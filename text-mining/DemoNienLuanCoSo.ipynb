       "'one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 oz episode you\\'ll be hooked. they are right, as this is exactly what happened with me. the first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word go. trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word. it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary. it focuses mainly on emerald city, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. em city is home to many..aryans, muslims, gangstas, latinos, christians, italians, irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away. i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn\\'t dare. forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...oz doesn\\'t mess around. the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, i couldn\\'t say i was ready for it, but as i watched more, i developed a taste for oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who\\'ll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who\\'ll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) watching oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side. a wonderful little production. the filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-bbc fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece. the actors are extremely well chosen- michael sheen not only \"has got all the polari\" but he has all the voices down pat too! you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams\\' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. a masterful production about one of the great master\\'s of comedy and his life. the realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional \\'dream\\' techniques remains solid then disappears. it plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with halliwell\\'s murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done. i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend, sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy. the plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable (even the well bread suspected serial killer). while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point 2: risk addiction, i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love. this was the most i\\'d laughed at one of woody\\'s comedies in years (dare i say a decade?). while i\\'ve never been impressed with scarlet johanson, in this she managed to tone down her \"sexy\" image and jumped right into a average, but spirited young woman. this may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was wittier than \"devil wears prada\" and more interesting than \"superman\" a great comedy to go see with friends. basically there\\'s a family where a little boy (jake) thinks there\\'s a zombie in his closet & his parents are fighting all the time. this movie is slower than a soap opera... and suddenly, jake decides to become rambo and kill the zombie. ok, first of all when you\\'re going to make a film you must decide if its a thriller or a drama! as a drama the movie is watchable. parents are divorcing & arguing like in real life. and then we have jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film! i expected to see a boogeyman similar movie, and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots. 3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents & descent dialogs. as for the shots with jake: just ignore them. petter mattei\\'s \"love in the time of money\" is a visually stunning film to watch. mr. mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. this being a variation on the arthur schnitzler\\'s play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect. each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat. the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter. the acting is good under mr. mattei\\'s direction. steve buscemi, rosario dawson, carol kane, michael imperioli, adrian grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive. we wish mr. mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work. probably my all-time favorite movie, a story of selflessness, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it\\'s not preachy or boring. it just never gets old, despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years. paul lukas\\' performance brings tears to my eyes, and bette davis, in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles, is a delight. the kids are, as grandma says, more like \"dressed-up midgets\" than children, but that only makes them more fun to watch. and the mother\\'s slow awakening to what\\'s happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling. if i had a dozen thumbs, they\\'d all be \"up\" for this movie. i sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me.i grew up on black and white tv and seahunt with gunsmoke were my hero\\'s every week.you have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt.we need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of under water adventure.oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about tv and the many movies.so any ole way i believe i\\'ve got what i wanna say.would be nice to read some more plus points about sea hunt.if my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submit,or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit,if this is so then i must go so lets do it. this show was an amazing, fresh & innovative idea in the 70\\'s when it first aired. the first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but things dropped off after that. by 1990, the show was not really funny anymore, and it\\'s continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today. it\\'s truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen. the writing is painfully bad, the performances are almost as bad - if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest-hosts, this show probably wouldn\\'t still be on the air. i find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand-selected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed. how can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity? i felt i must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success. as it is now, the show is just awful. i can\\'t believe it\\'s still on the air. encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film. bad mistake. i\\'ve seen 950+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it\\'s awful in almost every way: editing, pacing, storyline, \\'acting,\\' soundtrack (the film\\'s only song - a lame country tune - is played no less than four times). the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film. the only thing that prevents me giving this a 1-score is harvey keitel - while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort. one for keitel obsessives only. if you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie. if you are young or old then you will love this movie, hell even my mom liked it. great camp!!! phil the alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines. at first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed i didn\\'t find the jokes or oddness funny anymore. its a low budget film (thats never a problem in itself), there were some pretty interesting characters, but eventually i just lost interest. i imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking. for something similar but better try \"brother from another planet\" i saw this movie when i was about 12 when it came out. i recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air. the horror. the horror. as a young kid going to these cheesy b films on saturday afternoons, i still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero, a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end. i didn\\'t care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots. i love them now for the unintentional humor. but, about a year or so later, i saw psycho when it came out and i loved that the star, janet leigh, was bumped off early in the film. i sat up and took notice at that point. since screenwriters are making up the story, make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a well-worn formula. there are no rules. so im not a big fan of boll\\'s work but then again not many are. i enjoyed his movie postal (maybe im the only one). boll apparently bought the rights to use far cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished. people who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned, that this is not far cry... this is something mr boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks.. feeling loneley on the set mr boll invites three of his countrymen to play with. these players go by the names of til schweiger, udo kier and ralf moeller. three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz. so the tale goes like this, jack carver played by til schweiger (yes carver is german all hail the bratwurst eating dudes!!) however i find that tils acting in this movie is pretty badass.. people have complained about how he\\'s not really staying true to the whole carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we don\\'t really know what he looked like when he was kicking a**.. however, the storyline in this film is beyond demented. we see the evil mad scientist dr. krieger played by udo kier, making genetically-mutated-soldiers or gms as they are called. performing his top-secret research on an island that reminds me of \"spoiler\" vancouver for some reason. thats right no palm trees here. instead we got some nice rich lumberjack-woods. we haven\\'t even gone far before i started to cry (mehehe) i cannot go on any more.. if you wanna stay true to bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true boll experience, meaning most of it will suck. there are some things worth mentioning that would imply that boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes. until the whole cromed/albino gms squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh.. the movie far cry reeks of scheisse (that\\'s poop for you simpletons) from a fa,r if you wanna take a wiff go ahead.. btw carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes he\\'s on screen. the cast played shakespeare. shakespeare lost. i appreciate that this is trying to bring shakespeare to the masses, but why ruin something so good. is it because \\'the scottish play\\' is my favorite shakespeare? i do not know. what i do know is that a certain rev bowdler (hence bowdlerization) tried to do something similar in the victorian era. in other words, you cannot improve perfection. i have no more to write but as i have to write at least ten lines of text (and english composition was never my forte i will just have to keep going and say that this movie, as the saying goes, just does not cut it. this a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous. one of the actors is george clooney and i\\'m not a fan but this roll is not bad. another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack (the man of constant sorrow). i recommand this movie to everybody. greetings bart kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes, only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i\\'ve ever seen. sort of like a high school film project. what was rosanna arquette thinking?? and what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed midwest town? pretty hard to get involved with this one. no lessons to be learned from it, no brilliant insights, just stilted and quite ridiculous (but lots of skin, if that intrigues you) videotaped nonsense....what was with the bisexual relationship, out of nowhere, after all the heterosexual encounters. and what was with that absurd dance, with everybody playing their stereotyped roles? give this one a pass, it\\'s like a million other miles of bad, wasted film, money that could have been spent on starving children or aids in africa..... some films just simply should not be remade. this is one of them. in and of itself it is not a bad film. but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title. liam neeson was excellent as he always is, and most of the cast holds up, with the exception of owen wilson, who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke. but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it\\'s attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects. again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film. but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more. this movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies. horrible. there wasn\\'t a continuous minute where there wasn\\'t a fight with one monster or another. there was no chance for any character development, they were too busy running from one sword fight to another. i had no emotional attachment (except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them) scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies, lotr, star wars and matrix. examples >the ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old star wars with yoda, obee one and vader. >the spider machine in the beginning was exactly like frodo being attacked by the spider in return of the kings. (elijah wood is the victim in both films) and wait......it hypnotizes (stings) its victim and wraps them up.....uh hello???? >and the whole machine vs. humans theme was the matrix..or terminator..... there are more examples but why waste the time? and will someone tell me what was with the nazi\\'s?!?! nazi\\'s???? there was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion. the movie could not decide if it was a children\\'s movie or an adult movie and wasn\\'t much of either. just awful. a real disappointment to say the least. save your money. i remember this film,it was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 74/75 my dad took me my brother & sister to newbury cinema in newbury berkshire england. i recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of grizzly adams actor dan haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies. if anyone knows where to find this on dvd etc please let me know.the cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away, would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it. an awful film! it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe. they\\'ve taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition. my complaint is not that they\\'ve taken liberties with the facts; if the story were good, that would perfectly fine. but it\\'s simply bizarre -- by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film, so why did they come up with this dishwater-dull script? i suppose there weren\\'t enough naked people in the factual version. it\\'s hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist\\'s life -- we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they\\'d favored the rest of the film with same brevity. after the success of die hard and it\\'s sequels it\\'s no surprise really that in the 1990s, a glut of \\'die hard on a .....\\' movies cashed in on the wrong guy, wrong place, wrong time concept. that is what they did with cliffhanger, die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly \\'stop or my mom will shoot\\' stallone\\'s career. cliffhanger is one big nit-pickers dream, especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing, base-jumping, aviation, facial expressions, acting skills. all in all it\\'s full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk. stallone even managed to get out-acted by a horse! however, if you an forget all the nonsense, it\\'s actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills, and unintentionally, plenty of laughs. you\\'ve got to love john lithgows sneery evilness, his tick every box band of baddies, and best of all, the permanently harassed and hapless \\'turncoat\\' agent, rex linn as travers. he may of been henry in \\'portrait of a serial killer\\' but michael rooker is noteworthy for a cringe-worthy performance as hal, he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors \\'that man never hurt anybody\\' and whilst he surely can\\'t be, it really does look like ralph waite\\'s frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death. mention too must go to former \\'london\\'s burning\\' actor craig fairbrass as the brit bad guy, who comes a cropper whilst using hal as a human football, yes, you can\\'t help enjoy that bit, hal needed a good kicking. so forget your better judgement, who cares if \\'that could never happen\\', lower your acting expectations, turn up the volume and enjoy! and if you\\'re looking for qaulen, he\\'s the one wearing the helicopter. i had the terrible misfortune of having to view this \"b-movie\" in it\\'s entirety. all i have to say is--- save your time and money!!! this has got to be the worst b-movie of all time, it shouldn\\'t even be called a b-movie, more like an f-movie! because it fails in all aspects that make a good movie: the story is not interesting at all, all of the actors are paper-thin and not at all believable, it has bad direction and the action sequences are so fake it\\'s almost funny.......almost. the movie is just packed full of crappy one-liners that no respectable person could find amusing in the least little bit. this movie is supposed to be geared towards men, but all the women in it are so utterly unattractive, especially that old wrinkled thing that comes in towards the end. they try to appear sexy in those weird, horrible costumes and they fail miserably!!! even some of the most ridiculous b-movies will still give you some laughs, but this is just too painful to watch!! what an absolutely stunning movie, if you have 2.5 hrs to kill, watch it, you won\\'t regret it, it\\'s too much fun! rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isn\\'t anything more other than him, i still liked it. the music by a.r.rehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times, you really start liking it. first of all, let\\'s get a few things straight here: a) i am an anime fan- always has been as a matter of fact (i used to watch speed racer all the time in preschool). b) i do like several b-movies because they\\'re hilarious. c) i like the godzilla movies- a lot. moving on, when the movie first comes on, it seems like it\\'s going to be your usual b-movie, down to the crappy fx, but all a sudden- boom! the anime comes on! this is when the movie goes wwwaaaaayyyyy downhill. the animation is very bad & cheap, even worse than what i remember from speed racer, for crissakes! in fact, it\\'s so cheap, one of the few scenes from the movie i \"vividly\" remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school... & it\\'s the same kids over & over again! the fx are terrible, too; the dinosaurs look worse than godzilla. in addition, the transition to live action to animation is unorganized, the dialogue & voices(especially the english dub that i viewed) was horrid & i was begging my dad to take the tape out of the dvd/ vhs player; the only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes & comments like the robots & joel/mike on mst3k (you pick the season). honestly, this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie & survive it at the same time. heck, i\\'m planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on halloween for a b-movie night. because it\\'s stupid, pretty painful to watch & unintentionally hilarious at the same time, i\\'m giving this movie a 3/10, an improvement from the 0.5/10 i was originally going to give it. (according to my grading scale: 3/10 means pretty much both boring & bad. as fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it, then it will become as fun as counting to 15.) this was the worst movie i saw at worldfest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards! i can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film. it\\'s great to see j.beals but she\\'s only in the movie for a few minutes. m.parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for. the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable. the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch. there is no real emotional depth to the story. a movie revolving about an actor who can\\'t get work doesn\\'t feel very original to me. nor does the development of the cop. it feels like one of many straight-to-video movies i saw back in the 90s ... and not even a good one in those standards. the karen carpenter story shows a little more about singer karen carpenter\\'s complex life. though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details. cynthia gibb (portrays karen) was not a fine election. she is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb karen carpenter. i think that the role needed a stronger character. someone with a stronger personality. louise fletcher role as agnes carpenter is terrific, she does a great job as karen\\'s mother. it has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album. unfortunately they weren\\'t, though this movie was on the top of the ratings in usa and other several countries \"the cell\" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. this is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. this is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. this is the best movie of the year to date. i\\'ve read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. to negatively criticize this film is to miss the point. this movie may be a landmark, a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow. \"the cell\" has just opened the door to another world of imagination. so can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director tarsem singh that we don\\'t want any more? personally, i would more than welcome another movie by tarsem, and would love to see someone try to challenge him. we\\'ve all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer, and yes, i do agree that the \"genre\" is a bit overworked. the 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick; some of them worked, but most failed. but \"the cell\" does not blaze down the same trail, we are given a new twist, we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied. i like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how jennifer lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another. instead, she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long twizzlers and jaunted into another entity. \"the cell\" wants to let you \"see\" what it\\'s all about and not \"how\" it\\'s all about, and i guess that\\'s what some people don\\'t like. true, i do like explanations with my movies, but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in. i noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality, maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another. nonetheless, the set design was simply astonishing. i wouldn\\'t be surprised if this film took home a few oscars in cinematography, best costumes, best director and the like. if it were up to me it\\'d at least get nominated for best picture. i\\'ve noticed that i\\'ve kind of been repeating myself. not because there\\'s nothing else to say, but because i can\\'t stress enough how fantastic i thought \"the cell\" was. if you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye-popping feast then you are assured a good time. i guess this film was just a little too much for some people, writing it off as \"weird\" or \"crazy\". i am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind, so it was right down my alley. leaving the theater, i heard one audience member say \"whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs.\" if so, i want what he was smoking. **** (out of 4) this film tried to be too many things all at once: stinging political satire, hollywood blockbuster, sappy romantic comedy, family values promo... the list goes on and on. it failed miserably at all of them, but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end. although i appreciate the spirit behind war, inc., it depresses me to see such a clumsy effort, especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique, rather than simply the poor writing, direction, and production of this particular film. there is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war. but poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening. reminds me a bit of three kings, which similarly trivializes a genuine cause for concern. this movie was so frustrating. everything seemed energetic and i was totally prepared to have a good time. i at least thought i\\'d be able to stand it. but, i was wrong. first, the weird looping? it was like watching \"america\\'s funniest home videos\". the damn parents. i hated them so much. the stereo-typical latino family? i need to speak with the person responsible for this. we need to have a talk. that little girl who was always hanging on someone? i just hated her and had to mention it. now, the final scene transcends, i must say. it\\'s so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own. what crappy dancing. horrible and beautiful at once. war movie\\' is a hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichã©d dialogue, rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. the civil war-era \"cold mountain,\" starring jude law, nicole kidman and renã©e zellweger is such a film. then again, calling cold mountain\" a war movie is not entirely accurate. true enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts \"glory\" director edward zwick shame. however, \"cold mountain\" is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. the story centers around disgruntled confederate soldier inman, played by jude law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain, north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, ada monroe, played by nicole kidman. at first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier\\'s tribulations on the battlefield. indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived. \"cold mountain\" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. meanwhile, back at the farm, ada\\'s cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. coming to ada\\'s rescue is the course, tough-as-nails ruby thewes, played by renã©e zellweger, who helps ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon ada. within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn south unfolds. the characters with whom inman and ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of brendan gleeson as ruby\\'s deadbeat father, ray winstone as an unrepentant southern \"lawman,\" and natalie portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. all have been greatly affected and changed by \"the war of northern aggression,\" mostly for the worse. the dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of virginia and north carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it\\'s hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant. director anthony minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. the love story between inman and ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot. make no mistake, \"cold mountain\" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether. taut and organically gripping, edward dmytryk\\'s crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller, an unlikely \"message\" movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle. bivouacked in washington, dc, a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars. three of them end up at a stranger\\'s apartment where robert ryan, drunk and belligerent, beats their host (sam levene) to death because he happens to be jewish. police detective robert young investigates with the help of robert mitchum, who\\'s assigned to ryan\\'s outfit. suspicion falls on the second of the three (george cooper), who has vanished. ryan slays the third buddy (steve brodie) to insure his silence before young closes in. abetted by a superior script by john paxton, dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring bobs. ryan, naturally, does his prototypical angry white male (and to the hilt), while mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance (his role, however, is not central); young may never have been better. gloria grahame gives her first fully-fledged rendition of the smart-mouthed, vulnerable tramp, and, as a sad sack who\\'s leeched into her life, paul kelly haunts us in a small, peripheral role that he makes memorable. the politically engaged dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing, but it\\'s pretty much confined to young\\'s reminiscence of how his irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier (thus, incidentally, stretching chronology to the limit). at least there\\'s no attempt to render an explanation, however glib, of why ryan hates jews (and hillbillies and...). curiously, crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it -- the novel it\\'s based on (richard brooks\\' the brick foxhole) dealt with a gay-bashing murder. but homosexuality in 1947 was still beyond the pale. news of the holocaust had, however, begun to emerge from the ashes of europe, so hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against anti-semitism (the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer). but while the change from homophobia to anti-semitism works in general, the specifics don\\'t fit so smoothly. the victim\\'s chatting up a lonesome, drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd, even though (or especially since) there\\'s a girlfriend in tow. it raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tip-off to the original engine generating ryan\\'s murderous rage. \"ardh satya\" is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema. directed by the great director govind nihalani, this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success. even today, ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india. the film tells the real-life scenario of mumbai police of the 70s. unlike any police of other cities in india, mumbai police encompasses a different system altogether. govind nihalani creates a very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment. amongst various police officers & colleagues, the film describes the story of anand velankar, a young hot-blooded cop coming from a poor family. his father is a harsh police constable. anand himself suffers from his father\\'s ideologies & incidences of his father\\'s atrocities on his mother. anand\\'s approach towards immediate action against crime, is an inert craving for his own job satisfaction. the film is here revolved in a plot wherein anand\\'s constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors.this leads to frustrations, as he cannot achieve the desired job-satisfaction. resulting from the frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars, also turning him to an alcoholic. the spirit within him is still alive, as he constantly fights the system. he is aware of the system of the metro, where the police & politicians are a inertly associated by far end. his compromise towards unethical practice is negative. finally he gets suspended. the direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core. one of the best memorable scenes is when anand breaks in the underworld gangster rama shetty\\'s house to arrest him, followed by short conversation which is fantastic. at many scenes, the film has hair-raising moments. the practical approach of script is a major punch. alcoholism, corruption, political influence, courage, deceptions all are integral part of mumbai police even today. those aspects are dealt brilliantly. finally, the films belongs to the one man show, om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly. my first exposure to the templarios & not a good one. i was excited to find this title among the offerings from anchor bay video, which has brought us other cult classics such as \"spider baby\". the print quality is excellent, but this alone can\\'t hide the fact that the film is deadly dull. there\\'s a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the templars (& set the whole thing in motion), but everything else in the movie is slow, ponderous &, ultimately, unfulfilling. adding insult to injury: the movie was dubbed, not subtitled, as promised on the video jacket. one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist, the mafia middle-man titta di girolamo, a physically non-descript, middle-aged man originally from salerno in southern italy. when we\\'re introduced to him at the start of the film, he\\'s been living a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italian-speaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years, conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamo\\'s cash tell him that 10,000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. at the news, he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. meanwhile he tells us, the spectators, that when you bluff, you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. he says: you can\\'t bluff for a while and then halfway through, tell the truth. having eventually done this - bluffed only halfway through and told the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately, love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamo\\'s troubles. this initially unsympathetic character, a scowling, taciturn, curt man on the verge of 50, a man who won\\'t even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye, becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. at one point in his non-life, titta decides to feel concern about appearing \"ridiculous\". the first half of the film may be described as \"slow\" by some. it does indeed reveal di girolamo\\'s days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined, deliberate pace, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. however, scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. the existence of titta di girolamo - the man with no imagination, identity or life, the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (one theme by the scottish band boards of canada especially stood out). never was the contrast between the way hollywood and italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as le conseguenze dell\\'amore or l\\'imbalsamatore. another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist\\'s insomnia. not unlike the machinist (and in a far more explicit way, the al pacino film insomnia), le conseguenze dell\\'amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that\\'s been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious, it\\'s almost impossible to pin-point its cause (if indeed there is one). the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia (played by olivia magnani, grand-daughter of the legendary anna) and the memory of titta\\'s best friend, a man whom he hasn\\'t seen in 20 years, unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that titta eventually (though tentatively at first) accepts to look through again. though it\\'s never explicitly spelt out, the spectator knows that to a man like titta, accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences. a film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator\\'s expectations, le conseguenze dell\\'amore is a fine representative of that small, quiet, discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecittã during the second half of the 70s. the world is waiting for italy to produce more il postino-like fare, more la vita ã¨ bella-style films... neglecting to explore fine creations like le conseguenze dell\\'amore, l\\'imbalsamatore and others. your loss, world. i watched this film not really expecting much, i got it in a pack of 5 films, all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could i expect? and you know what i was right, they were all terrible, this movie has a few (and a few is stretching it) interesting points, the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch, the drummer is very like a drummer, i.e damned annoying and, well thats about it actually, the problem is that its just so boring, in what i can only assume was an attempt to build tension, a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious (i had my thumb on the fast forward button, ready to press for most of the movie, but gave it a go) and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking, coz they don\\'t half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot, i thought he looked a bit like a meercat, all this and i haven\\'t even mentioned the killer, i\\'m not even gonna go into it, its just not worth explaining. anyway as far as i\\'m concerned star and london are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london (who was actually quite funny) it wasn\\'t because of their acting talent, i\\'ve certainly seen a lot worse, but i\\'ve also seen a lot better. best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry. i bought this film at blockbuster for $3.00, because it sounded interesting (a bit ranma-esque, with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton), because there was a cute girl in a mini-skirt on the back, and because there was a restricted viewing sticker on it. i thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge. i was 100% wrong. having watched it, i have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker, since there is hardly any foul language, little violence, and the closest thing to nudity (honestly! i don\\'t usually go around hoping for it!) is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties (you see her panties a lot in this movie, because no matter what, she\\'s wearing a miniskirt of some sort). even the anti-religious humor is tame (and lame, caricatured, insincere, derivative, unoriginal, and worst of all not funny in the slightest--it would be better just to listen to ray stevens\\' \"would jesus wear a rolex on his television show\"). this would barely qualify as pg-13 (it is not rated), but blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent this--as if it was pornographic. any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of requiem for a dream, but they insist that zack and reba is worse. it is, but not in that way. in a way, this worries me--the only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning. if anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides (not this one, but better ones like the virgin suicides), it\\'s teenagers. if both of those movies were rated r purely because of the suicide aspect, then i have little chance of turning a story i\\'ve been writing into a pg-13 movie (the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve). suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers (i think it\\'s number 2), so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by it. just say no to this movie, though. 2/10. the plot is about the death of little children. hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings. during the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter. in the end the serial killer get caught. that\\'s it. but before you find out who dunnit, you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors. it is unbelievable how bad these actors are, including hopper. i could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time. just don\\'t watch the movie. i\\'ve warned you. ever watched a movie that lost the plot? well, this didn\\'t even really have one to begin with. where to begin? the achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms (that are strangely never actually heard in the house-great double glazing)? the house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away(?) or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable? or even the beginning which suggests a spate of 20+ killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house? or the bizarre ritual with the salt & pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of direction. add a lead actress who can\\'t act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty, but not in the way you hope. given a following simply for being banned in the uk in the 80\\'s (mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder) it offers nothing but curiosity value- and one classic \\'daft\\' murder (don\\'t worry-its telegraphed at least ten minutes before). after a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up. halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe. what do they do? slide down and run like the rest of us? no, of course not- they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weapon. it really is only a movie as they say.. okay, so this series kind of takes the route of \\'here we go again!\\' week in, week out david morse\\'s character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle - but what\\'s wrong with that!? david morse is one of the greatest character actors out there, and certainly the coolest, and to have him in a series created by david koepp - a great writer - is heaven!! due to the lack of love for this show by many, i can\\'t see it going to a season series - but you never know? the amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me - let\\'s hope something good can make it past a first series!!! after sitting through this pile of dung, my husband and i wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie. it was that listless and formulaic. but the u.s. propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves--disappointingly--that it\\'s the work of humans. call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes like, \"we have to steal the declaration of independence to protect it\" seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of iraq, etc. the fact that nicholas cage spews lines like, \"i would never use the declaration of independence as a bargaining chip\" with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took valium before shooting each scene. the \"reasoning\" behind each plot turn and new \"clue\" is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow. and there\\'s also a bonus side plot of misogyny, with dr. whatever-her-name-was being chided by all involved for \"never shutting up.\" she\\'s clearly in the movie only for looks, but they felt the need to slap a \"dr.\" title on her character to give her some gravity. at one point, cage\\'s character says, \"don\\'t you ever shut up?\" and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands, like she\\'s a child. truly grotesque. the only benefit to this movie was that it\\'s so astonishingly bad, you do get a few laughs out of it. the really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it. creepy.... it had all the clichã©s of movies of this type and no substance. the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watching it. the production was good; however, the script and acting were b-movie quality. the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors. the good actors didn\\'t hold their own nor did they lift up the others. this movie is not worthy of more words, but i will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines. james wood and cuba gooding, jr. play caricatures of themselves in other movies. if you are looking for mindless entertainment, i still wouldn\\'t recommend this movie. this movie is based on the book, \"a many splendored thing\" by han suyin and tackles issues of race relations between asians and whites, a topic that comes from han\\'s personal experiences as an eurasian growing up in china. that background, and the beautiful hong kong settings, gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time. other than that, the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself. the beautiful jennifer jones looks the part and gives a wonderful, oscar nominated performance as a doctor of mixed breed during the advent of communism in mainland china. william holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world. the acting is top notch, and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined. the cinematography really brings out fifty\\'s hong kong, especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments. the ending is a real tear-jerker. some may consider sentimental romances passã©, but, for those who enjoy classic hollywood love stories, this is a shining example. of all the films i have seen, this one, the rage, has got to be one of the worst yet. the direction, logic, continuity, changes in plot-script and dialog made me cry out in pain. \"how could anyone come up with something so crappy\"? gary busey is know for his \"b\" movies, but this is a sure \"w\" movie. (w=waste). take for example: about two dozen fbi & local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer. inside the jeep is ma and is \"confused\" as to why all the cops are about. within seconds a huge gun battle ensues, ma being killed straight off. the cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them. the cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet/pellet. ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed-damn that guy is tough. truly a miracle, not since the six-shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle. i had heard good things about \"states of grace\" and came in with an open mind. i thought that \"god\\'s army\" was okay, and i thought that maybe dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker. the film began with some shaky acting, and i thought, \"well, maybe it will get better.\" unfortunately, it never did. the picture starts out by introducing two elders -- mormon missionaries -- and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them. instead, the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries (something that undeniably exists, but rarely on the level that dutcher portrays) and it becomes almost laughable. dutcher\\'s only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience. by unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of mormon missionaries, dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly mormon audience. the film in no way reflects reality. missions are nothing like what dutcher shows (having served a mormon mission myself i can attest to this fact) and gang life in california certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity. the conclusion, which i\\'m assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all, was both unbelievable (c\\'mon, the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home -- and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other!) and cheesy. next time, dutcher, try making a movie that someone can identify with. this movie struck home for me. being 29, i remember the \\'80\\'s and my father working in a factory. i figured, if i worked hard too, if i had pride and never gave up i too could have the american dream, the house, a few kids, a car all to call my own. i\\'ve noted however, without a degree in something (unlike my father that quit at ninth grade) and a keen sense of greed and laziness, you can\\'t get anywhere. i would like to know if anyone has this movie on dvd or vhs. it\\'s made for tv, and i just saw it an hour ago. ic an\\'t find it anywhere! i\\'d love to show this to my friends, my pseudo friends, family and other relatives, see what they think and remind them that once upon a time, americans would work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished!! i think the feeling is still there, but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas... as a disclaimer, i\\'ve seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and i only just saw the musical this week. this allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn\\'t in the musical (however, it tainted me when i watched the musical :) ) i actually believe michael douglas worked quite well in that role, along with kasey. i think her \\'let me dance for you scene\\' is one of the best parts of the movie, a worthwhile addition compared to the musical. the dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical, as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger (easier to do in the movie of course). the decors, lighting, dancing, and singing are also much superior in the movie, which should be expected, and was indeed delivered. the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie, the new ones are quite good ones, and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion, especially compared to a musical which has few decors. the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking, and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters, but their dancing is impeccable, and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors. the story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an arab dignitary. the story goes downhill halfway through the movie and goldie\\'s charm just doesn\\'t save this movie. unless you are a goldie hawn fan don\\'t go out of your way to see this film. how this film could be classified as drama, i have no idea. if i were john voight and mary steenburgen, i would be trying to erase this from my cv. it was as historically accurate as xena and hercules. abraham and moses got melded into noah. lot, abraham\\'s nephew, lot, turns up thousands of years before he would have been born. canaanites wandered the earth...really? what were the scriptwriters thinking? was it just ignorance (\"i remember something about noah and animals, and lot and canaanites and all that stuff from sunday school\") or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible- from christians, jews and muslims, to historians, archaeologists, geologists, psychologists, linguists ...as a matter of fact, did anyone not get offended? anyone who had even a modicum of taste would have winced at this one! preston sturgis\\' the power and the glory was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television. in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kael\\'s the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz - orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis\\' screenplay here. as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site, kael overstated her case. there are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of charles foster kane: the newsreel (representing ralston - the henry luce clone), thatcher\\'s memoirs, bernstein, jed leland, susan alexander kane, and raymond the butler. each has his or her different slant on kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. and of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of kane\\'s story. this method also leads to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident. this is not the situation in the power and the glory. yes, like kane it is about a legendary business leader - here it is tom garner (spencer tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. but there are only two narrators - they are garner\\'s right hand man henry (ralph morgan) and his wife (sarah padden). this restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of kane in garner. henry, when he narrates, is talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. his wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in henry. typical example: although he worked his way up, tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later years. unions are troublemakers, and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. henry describes tom\\'s confrontation with the union in a major walk-out, and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life. but henry\\'s wife reminds him how tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the union\\'s headquarters - killing many people). so we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black. i\\'m not really knocking the power and the glory for not duplicating kane\\'s success (few films do - including all of orson welles\\' other films), but i am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one\\'s interest to the end. and thanks to the performances of tracy and colleen moore as his wife sally, the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home. when they marry, tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. but in america great business success comes at a cost. tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire (he expands it and improves it constantly). but it takes him away from home too much, and he loses touch with sally. and he also notices eve (helen vinson), the younger woman who becomes his mistress. when sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her. similarly tom too gets a full shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of henry). eve marries tom, and presents him with a son - but it turns out to be eve\\'s son by tom\\'s son tom jr. (philip trent). the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes tom to shoot himself. the film is not a total success - the action jumps at times unconvincingly. yet it does make the business seem real (note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line, and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). sturgis came from a wealthy background, so he could bring in this type of detail. so on the whole it is a first rate film. no citizen kane perhaps, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america. average (and surprisingly tame) fulci giallo which means it\\'s still quite bad by normal standards, but redeemed by its solid build-up and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance. the genre\\'s well-known weaknesses are in full gear: banal dialogue, wooden acting, illogical plot points. and the finale goes on much too long, while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall i say: limp affair. fulci\\'s ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing, though. yellow clues wherever you look. 3 out of 10 limping killers return to the 36th chamber is one of those classic kung-fu movies which shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s, whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of hollywood, and the protagonist gordon liu, the counterpart to the western\\'s clint eastwood. digitally remastered and a new print made for the fantastic film fest, this is \"presented in shaw scope\", just like the good old days. this film is a simple story of good versus evil, told in 3 acts, which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era. act one sets up the premise. workers in a dye-mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot, having their wages cut by 20% by incoming manchu gangsters. they can\\'t do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters, and their boss. at first they had a minor success in getting liu to impersonate a highly skilled shaolin monk (one of the best comedy sequences), but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times. act two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob. however, without real martial arts, he embarks on a journey to shaolin temple, to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly. after some slapstick moments, he finally gets accepted by the abbot (whom he impersonated!) but is disappointed at the teaching methods - kinda like mr miyagi\\'s style in karate kid, but instead of painting fences, he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple. nothing can keep a good man down, and he unwittingly builds strength, endurance and learns kung-fu the unorthodox way. act three is where the fight fest begins. with cheesy sound effects, each obvious non-contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment. but it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here, with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners, and the use of slow-motion only to showcase stunts in different angles. you may find the speed of fights a tad too slow, with some pause in between moves, but with yuen wo ping and his style being used ad-nausem in hollywood flicks, they sure don\\'t make fight scenes like they used to! return to the 36th chamber gets a repeat screening on monday, so, if you\\'re game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane, what are you waiting for? ***spoilers*** all too, in real life as well as in the movies, familiar story that happens to many young men who are put in a war zone with a gun, or rifle, in their hands. the case of young and innocent, in never handling or firing a gun, jimmy davis, franchot tone, has been repeated thousands of times over the centuries when men, like jimmy davis, are forced to take up arms for their country. jimmy who at first wanted to be kicked out of the us army but was encouraged to stay, by being belted in the mouth, by his good friend fred p. willis, spencer tracy, ended up on the front lines in france. with jimmy\\'s unit pinned down by a german machine gun nest he single handedly put it out of commission picking off some half dozen german soldiers from the safety of a nearby church steeple. it was when jimmy gunned down the last surviving german, who raised his arms in surrender, that an artillery shell hit the steeple seriously wounding him. recovering from his wounds at an army hospital jimmy fell in love with us army volunteer nurse rose duffy, gladys george. rose was really in love with jimmy\\'s good friend the happy go lucky fred despite his obnoxious antics towards her. it\\'s when fred was lost during the fighting on the western front that rose, thinking that he was killed, fell in love and later married jimmy. when fred unexpectedly showed up in the french town where jimmy, now fully recovered from his wounds, was stationed at things got very sticky for both him and rose who had already accepted jimmy\\'s proposal of marriage to her! with wwi over and jimmy marrying rose left fred, who\\'s still in love with her, a bitter and resentful young man. it was almost by accident that fred ran into jimmy on the streets of new york city and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and non-violent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the european western front. smug and sure of himself, and his ability to shoot a gun, jimmy had become a top mobster in new york city\\'s underworld! not only that but as fred later found out his wife rose had no idea what jimmy was really involved in with jimmy telling her that he works as a law abiding and inoffensive insurance adjuster. jimmy\\'s life of crime came full circle when rose, after she found out about his secret life, ratted him out to the police to prevent him from executing a \"valentine day\" like massacre, with his gang members dressed as cops, of his rival mobsters. while on trial jimmy came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then, after his three year sentence is up, get his life back together. ***spoiler alert*** hearing rumors from fellow convicts that rose and his best friend fred were having an affair behind his back jimmy broke out of prison ending up a fugitive from the law. it\\'s at fred\\'s circus, where he works as both manger and barker, that jimmy in seeing that rose as well as fred were true to him that he, like at his trial, had a sudden change of heart. but the thought of going back to prison, with at least another ten years added on to his sentence, was just too much for jimmy! it was then that jimmy decided to end it all by letting the police who by then tracked him down do the job, that he himself didn\\'t have the heart to do, for him! bela lugosi appeared in several of these low budget chillers for monogram studios in the 1940\\'s and the corpse vanishes is one of the better ones. bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then extracts fluid from their bodies so he can keep his ageing wife looking young. after a reporter and a doctor stay the night at his home and discover he is responsible for the brides\\' deaths, the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and drops dead shortly afterwards. you have got almost everything in this movie: the scientist\\'s assistants consist of an old hag, a hunchback and dwarf (her sons), a thunderstorm and spooky passages in bela\\'s house. bela and his wife find they sleep better in coffins rather than beds in the movie. the corpse vanishes is worth a look, especially for bela lugosi fans. great fun. rating: 3 stars out of 5. i cannot believe i enjoyed this as much as i did. the anthology stories were better than par, but the linking story and its surprise ending hooked me. alot of familiar faces will keep you asking yourself \"where i have i seen them before?\" forget the running time listed on new line\\'s tape, this ain\\'t no 103 minutes, according to my vcr timer and imdb. space maggot douses the campfire in his own special way and hikes this an 8. the 33 percent of the nations nitwits that still support w. bush would do well to see this movie, which shows the aftermath of the french revolution and the terror of 1794 as strikingly similar to the post 9/11 socio-political landscape. maybe then they could stop worrying about saving face and take the a**-whupping they deserve. it\\'s really a shame that when a politician ruins the country, those who voted for him can\\'t be denied the right to ever vote again. they\\'ve clearly shown they have no sense of character. what really stands out in this movie is the ambiguity of a character as hopelessly doctrinaire as robespierre; a haunted empty man who simplistic reductive ideology can\\'t help him elucidate the boundaries between safety and totalitarianism. execution and murder. self-defense and patriotism. his legalistic litmus tests aggravate the hopeless situation he\\'s helped create. sound like any belligerent, overprivileged, retarded yale cheerleaders you know of? wojciech pszoniak blows the slovenly deparidieu off the screen. as sympathetic as robespierres plight is, it\\'s comforting to know that shortly after the film ends he\\'ll have his jaw shot off and be sent to the guillotine. as someone has already mentioned on this board, it\\'s very difficult to make a fake documentary. it requires tremendous skill, pacing, patience, directorial \\'distance,\\' a plausible premise, a narrative \\'flow,\\' and really believable acting (aka great acting). such is not the case with \\'love machine\\'. it starts to show its faux hand about the 20-minute mark (with 60 minutes left to watch), and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in. it\\'s downhill from there. director gordon eriksen simply peaked too soon. but to be fair to eriksen, his problems started early: as he explains in the extras, he began wanting to do a real doc, couldn\\'t get funding, and settled for a cheaper way of making his film. the premise -- people who have secret lives by posting themselves on a porn website -- was perhaps more interesting in 1997-98, when the film was made. eriksen does a lot of tricky stuff -- a pushy \\'host,\\' hand-held cameras, zooms, grainy blacks and whites -- all, i guess, to elicit a sense of authenticity, but it just doesn\\'t work. the film is confusing and forced, but what ultimately brings it down is the believability of the actors and the pretty awful dialogue. the hills have eyes ii is what you would expect it to be and nothing more. of course it\\'s not going to be an oscar nominated film, it\\'s just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes. the plot is basically about a group of national guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert. it\\'s just them fighting back throughout the whole film, which includes a lot of violence (which is basically the whole film) as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing, and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience. i\\'d give the hills have eyes ii 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment, and that only. although even then i found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on, as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake. the hills have eyes ii is just decent entertainment, something to pass time if you\\'re bored, and nothing else. 4/10 i laughed all the way through this rotten movie. it\\'s so unbelievable. a woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage, has a breakdown in front of a real estate office. what happens? the office manager comes outside and offers her a job!!! hilarious! next thing you know the two women are going at it. yep, they\\'re lesbians! nothing rings true in this \"lifetime for women with nothing better to do\" movie. clunky dialogue like \"i don\\'t want to spend the rest of my life feeling like i had a chance to be happy and didn\\'t take it\" doesn\\'t help. there\\'s a wealthy, distant mother who disapproves of her daughter\\'s new relationship. a sassy black maid - unbelievable that in the year 2003, a film gets made in which there\\'s a sassy black maid. hattie mcdaniel must be turning in her grave. the woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids. sheesh! no cliche is left unturned. no spoilers!! after hitchcock\\'s successful first american film, rebecca based upon daphne dumarier\\'s lush novel of gothic romance and intrigue, he returned to some of the more familiar themes of his early british period - mistaken identity and espionage. as the u.s. settled into world war ii and the large scale \\'war effort\\' of civilians building planes, weaponry and other necessary militia, the booming film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes. these thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good, law abiding citizens. knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre, producer jack skirball approached hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption, war-time sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity. the darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven dorothy parker (during her brief stint in hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in nyc) who co-authored the script were a perfect match for hitchcock\\'s sensibilities. this often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25 year old barry kane (robert cummings) who, while at work at a los angeles airplane factory, meets new employee frank frye (norman lloydd) and moments later is framed for committing sabotage. fleeing the authorities who don\\'t believe his far-fetched story he meets several characters on his way to soda city utah and finally new york city. these memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful \\'freaks\\' and a popular billboard model patricia martin (priscilla lane) who, during the worst crisis of his life as well as national security, he falls madly in love with! of course in the land of hitchcock, patricia, kidnapped by the supposed saboteur barry, falls for her captor thus adding romantic tension to the mix. in good form for this outing, hitchcock brews a national network of demure old ladies, average joes, and respectable businessmen who double as secret agent terrorists that harbor criminals, pull guns and detonate bombs to keep things moving. it\\'s a terrific plot that takes its time moving forward and once ignited, culminates in one of hitchcock\\'s more memorable finales. look for incredibly life like nyc tourist attractions (all of which were recreated by art directors in hollywood due to the war-time \\'shooting ban\\' on public attractions). while saboteur may not be one of hitchcock\\'s most well known films, it\\'s a popular b-movie that is certainly solid and engaging with plenty of clever plot twists and as usual - terrific hitchcock villains. remember to look for hitchcock\\'s cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the film. hitchcock\\'s original cameo idea that was shot (him fighting in sign language with his \\'deaf\\' wife) was axed by the bureau of standards and practices who were afraid of offending the deaf! i just watched the dresser this evening, having only seen it once before, about a dozen years ago. it\\'s not a \"big\" movie, and doesn\\'t try to make a big splash, but my god, the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless. albert finney and tom courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie. the dresser is the story of sir, an aging shakespearean actor (finney), and his dresser norman (courtenay), sort of a valet, putting on a production of king lear during the blitz of london in world war ii. these are two men, each dependent upon the other: sir is almost helpless without the aid of norman to cajole, wheedle, and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of lear. and norman lives his life vicariously through sir; without sir to need him, he is nothing, or thinks he is, anyway. this is a character-driven film; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters, and as such, it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life. finney, only 47 years old, is completely believable as a very old, very sick, petulant, bullying, but brilliant stage actor. he hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they\\'re taking their bows! and courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser, who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer. employer is really the wrong term to use, though. for although, technically their relationship is that of employer and employee, most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple. yes, there are others in the cast of this movie, but there is no question that the true stars are finney, courtenay, and the marvelous script by ronald harwood. that is not to say that there aren\\'t other fine performances, most notably eileen atkins as the long-suffering stage manager madge. there is a wonderful scene where sir and madge talk about old desires, old regrets, and what might have been. although it doesn\\'t get talked about these days, it is worth remembering that the dresser was nominated for five academy awards: best actor nominations for both finney and courtenay, best picture, best director (peter yates), and best adapted screenplay. i had remembered this as being a good movie, but i wasn\\'t prepared to be as completely mesmerized as i was from beginning to end. if you want to see an example of what great acting is all about, and be hugely entertained all the while, then i encourage you to see the dresser. what happened? what we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the movie loses it. actually, it never really got going. there was a little excitement when we find out that angie is not really pregnant, then find out that she is after all, but that was it. steve martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie, was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie, other than to make it longer. i really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters, kate and angie, and maybe try not for a pure comedy, which unfortunately it was not, but maybe a drama with comedic elements. i think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here i can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot. i\\'ve just watched fingersmith, and i\\'m stunned to see the 8/10 average rating for the show. not only was the plot was difficult to follow, but it seems character development was randomly applied. the actors were adequate, but in the process of attempting to create twists and turns, their characters are rendered entirely one dimensional. once this happens, the story really falls flat and becomes tedious. and just in case anyone didn\\'t see the predictable lesbian undertones from miles way, this is hammered home in the most banal terms at the end of the film. the end scene is disappointing and phoned in, and anyone who sat back and went \"ohhh, so they were carpet munchers all along!\", must have been out for the evening. two stars for the tonsil hockey in the earlier scene which was at least a bit raunchy, none for the rest of it... so let\\'s begin!))) the movie itself is as original as cronenberg\\'s movies would usually appear... my intention to see it was certainly jjl being one of my favourite actresses. she is as lovely as usual, this cutie! i would not say it was my favourite movie of hers. still it\\'s quite interesting and entertaining to follow. the rest of the cast is not extremely impressive but it is not some kind of a miscast star array. ;) recommend with confidence!)))) besides being boring, the scenes were oppressive and dark. the movie tried to portray some kind of moral, but fell flat with its message. what were the redeeming qualities?? on top of that, i don\\'t think it could make librarians look any more unglamorous than it did. an unmarried woman named stella (bette midler) gets pregnant by a wealthy man (stephen collins). he offers to marry her out of a sense of obligation but she turns him down flat and decides to raise the kid on her own. things go ok until the child named jenny (trini alvarado) becomes a teenager and things gradually (and predictably) become worse. i\\'ve seen both the silent version and sound version of \"stella dallas\". neither one affected me much (and i cry easily) but they were well-made if dated. trying to remake this in 1990 was just a stupid idea. i guess midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of \"beaches\" to get this made. this (predictably) bombed. the story is laughable and dated by today\\'s standards. even though midler and alvarado give good performances this film really drags and i was bored silly by the end. stephen collins and marsha mason (both good actors) don\\'t help in supporting roles. flimsy and dull. really--who thought this would work? see the 1937 stanwyck version instead. i give this a 1. don\\'t torture a duckling is one of fulci\\'s earlier (and honestly, in terms of story-line, better...) films - and although not the typical \"bloodbath\" that fulci is known for - this is still a very unique and enjoyable film. the story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders are occurring. some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations - either as suspects, or those \"helping\" the investigation (or in some cases both) - include the towns police force, a small-time reporter, a beautiful and rich ex-drug addict, a young priest and his mother, an old man who practices witchcraft and his female protã©gã©, a mentally handicapped townsman, and a deaf/mute little girl. all of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns, until the actual killer is revealed... don\\'t torture a duckling is neither a \"classical\" giallo or a typical fulci gore film. although it does contain elements of both - it is more of an old-fashioned murder mystery, with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence (although nothing nearly as strong as some of fulci\\'s later works). this is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end. recommended for giallo/murder-mystery fans, or anyone looking to check out some of fulci\\'s non-splatter films - but don\\'t despair, don\\'t torture still has more than it\\'s fair share of violence and sleaze. some may be put off by the subject of the child killings, and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys, which is also kind of disconcerting - but if that type of material doesn\\'t bother you, then definitely give this one a look. 8.5/10 busty beauty stacie randall plays pvc clad, bad-ass bitch alexandra, the faithful acolyte of faust, an evil entity trapped in hell. determined to free her master, the malevolent minx breaks into a warehouse to steal a magical gem vital to her success; but whilst conducting a satanic ritual to summon faust, the silly mare accidentally enters the pentagram she has drawn on the floor, which results in the loss of the gem and the release of two diminutive, troll-like creatures called lite and dark. now alexandra must find a replacement gem, which isn\\'t going to be easy: the only other stone that will do the trick is worn around the neck of her ex-lover, police detective jonathan graves (peter liapis), who is investigating the warehouse robbery and who knows only too well what evil alexandra is capable of. meanwhile, wise-cracking inter-dimensional half-pints lite and dark get into all sorts of zany trouble as they try to find a way back home. in the warped movie world of jim wynorski, all females are big-breasted babes with the fashion sense of a cheap hooker. ghoulies iv is no exception: every woman in this filmâ—whether she be a police captain, a curator of antiquities, or a mental patient in an asylumâ—is hot, hot, hot and wears not a lot, and it\\'s this fact that makes this otherwise totally unwatchable piece of stv crap just about bearable. but be warned, even though the presence of semi-naked, quality crumpet makes the going slightly easier, there is still plenty about this film to warrant it being labelled as an ordeal: the acting is wooden and the dialogue is painful; the black humour (as the dvd blurb describes it) is about as funny as a knee to the knackers, with the comedic banter of lite and dark being particularly cringe-worthy; and the special effects are bargain basement, consisting of rubbery creatures and visual effects that would have looked dated ten years earlier. 3/10 solely for the high bimbo quotient. i really like salman kahn so i was really disappointed when i seen this movie. it didn\\'t have much of a plot and what they did have was not that appealing. salman however did look good in the movie looked young and refreshed but was worth the price of this dvd. the music was not bad it was quite nice. usually indian movies are at least two to three hours long but this was a very short movie for an indian film. the american actress that played in the movie is from the television hit series heroes, ali larter. her acting had a lot to be desired. however she did look good in the indian dresses that she wore. all the movie had not a lot to be desired and i hope salman does a lot better on his next movie. thank you. i\\'m not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movies..which it is not. even though marques houston did appear in \"hp3\", he played a totally different character (he was, eight years older) in this film. okay...so reid and martin weren\\'t the most talented and couldn\\'t carry a film all by themselves..but to trade on the hp franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference (albeit minor) to the earlier movies. i\\'m sure everyone who wanted to see it was \"hoodwinked\"--into thinking that they were seeing a sequel--not a totally different film with a familiar name. and i\\'m sorry...kym whitley is not funny, and could not hold a candle to the late robin harris, ketty lester, or dc curry in the earlier films. although meagen good and mari morrow are a substantial visual diversion...i have to give this a thumbs down!! just naming the film \"down to the last minute\" would have been ok. furthermore, the hudlin brothers (who produced the first three movies) were not involved in the making of this film. this film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen. the writer obviously bought the playbook \"how to write a space disaster movie\" and followed it play by play. in particular, the stereo-typical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space - putting on a brave show in the face of disaster - has been done time and time again. max q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw $50 million at the project. but, judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects, the producers could only muster $50 thousand. to learn that the film was nominated for a \"special visual effects\" emmy has me absolutely gob-smacked. i think a handful of high school students with a pass in media studies could have created more believable effects! and the plot holes are too numerous to mention. but i will pick one out as an example. now, i\\'m no nasa expert, but surely it\\'s highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear-shaped with the program. surely there is someone more experienced at mission control who the program director would call on rather than a twenty-nine year old who has not been in the control room before. the only saving grace for this film is the work of bill campbell. he manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script. i give this film 2 out of 10, with the above-average work of bill campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark. caddyshack two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up. robert stack is a horrible replacement for ted knight and jackie mason, while funny just cant compete with rodney dangerfield. ty webb is funny, being the only character from the original. most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original (henry wilcoxon for example) except for the hystericly funny lawyer peter blunt, being played by randy quaid. every line he says reminds me of the originals humor, especially the scene at his office (i don\\'t go in for law suits or motions. i find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f***ing baseball bat, make a bonfire with the chippindale,maybe roast that golden retriever (arff arff arff) then eat it. and then i\\'m comin\\' upstairs junior, and i\\'m grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs, and cramming your brand new bmw up your tight a**! do we have an understanding?). offsetting his small role however, is dan acroyd, who is obviously no replacement for bill murray. his voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny, its just stupid. overall caddyshack ii is a good movie, but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it. honestly - this short film sucks. the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience. the unearthed dvd is crisp and clear and i haven\\'t made up my mind if this helps or hinders it. if the film was a little grainy it might have added some \"creepiness factor\" to what was going on. i have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter - but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like nekromantik and visitor q among others, are more shocking than in aftermath. all this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull****. this is an expensive, beautifully filmed turd. it\\'s not that shocking, it\\'s not that disgusting. if you insist on viewing it - rent it. i give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia (there should definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos ;) - the filming is good and it does have some \"gore\" (if watching a rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore...) but other than that - absolutely nothing going for this over-hyped mess. on the other hand - genesis - cerda\\'s \"sequel\" to aftermath (now available as a \"double feature\" released by unearthed films) is an absolute masterpiece of a short film, really showing what a good director cerda really is when given the right material. although i don\\'t care for aftermath at all, genesis is so well made that i will forgive cerda and definitely keep an eye out for him in the future... i thought that mukhsin has been wonderfully written. its not just about entertainment. there\\'s tonnes of subtle messages that i think yasmin was trying to bring across. and yes, it might be confusing to some of you(especially if you didn\\'t watch sepet and/or gubra for 76 times). i bet u noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right? its really ironic how the characters relate. like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from gubra. and the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future. and i absolutely love the voice-overs. its crude yet awakeningly fresh. like, when they took a shot of the rumah tumpangan gamin signboard, then there was suddenly mukhsin\\'s voice saying \\'bismillahhirrahmannirrahim..\\' (the scene when he climbed the tree). it captured malaysian\\'s attitude(and in some mild way, sniggering at how pathetic it is) portrayed in the character. for example, even the kids can be really sharp tongued(complete with the shrill annoying voice) and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long. and how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl, when ur own life isn\\'t sorted out. all i can say is, this movie totally reached my expectation if not exceeded it. it kept me glued to the screen, i couldn\\'t even take my eyes off it. not even to make out in the cinema. ha ha. i am not a golf fan by any means. on may 26 about 10:30 pm the movie started with a scene in the late 1800\\'s. old movies i like but not golf however, within the first scene a young boy (harry vardon) is awaken by the voices of men. he goes outside to inquire what they are doing and is told they are going to build a golf something... so , then i turned the television off but something stirred me and it was back on. the movie is excellent. we then see this young boy now a man; professional golf player who is haunted with visions from his childhood. then we meet the true focus of the movie francis and the decisions he makes for golf. you meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that is so obvious during the period. then there is little eddie lowery his caddy with encouraging words and little pushes that are instrumental in francis winning. don\\'t want to give away too much . i was up until 2 a.m. this is super please see the movie. upon viewing tobe hooper\\'s gem, crocodile, in 2000, i developed a great interest in the college/crocodile niche of the exploitation/monster genre. i look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequels to these delightful bonbons of camp goodness. if only ed wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts. with ed writing the scripts, and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effects on a computer, all we\\'d need would be a cast of crocky fodder with russ meyer breasts and ren hoek pectoral implants. while tobe hooper\\'s crocky opus referenced his own movies, blood surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging themes from the chum bucket of other movies. see if you can look past the revenge of the nerds sequel sets to find the allusions/homages?/rip-offs to jaws, temple of doom, indiana jones\\' last crusade, the convent, godzilla 2000, and any james bond movie. also, try to find the ready-for-tv fade where the editor gave up on making sense of the stock. i was disappointed the crock didn\\'t get to try out its sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmentalism...or crocky appreciation, but the quasi-captain ahab of the story does get his tour de force speach. perhaps, in the coming years, we\\'ll see a crock galloping off after a shootout into a golden sunset. or hopefully, a monkey will flush a crocky down the toilet of an international space station for midgets and enjoy the exploitative waltz of zero-g monkey/midget/crocodile bloodshed. all-in-all, the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music irked me. it tries to be the epic adventure of the century. and with a cast like shã´ kasugi, christopher lee and john-rhys davies it really is the perfect b-adventure of all time. it\\'s actually is a pretty fun, swashbuckling adventure that, even with it\\'s flaws, captures your interest. it must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it. even if it\\'s made in the 90s, it doesn\\'t have a modern feel. it more has the same feeling that a old errol flynn movie had. big adventure movie are again the big thing in hollywood but i\\'m afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had. this on the other hand, just has the real feeling. you just can\\'t hate it. i think it\\'s an okay adventure movie. and i really love the soundtrack. damn, i want the theme song. the last hard men finds james coburn an outlaw doing a long sentence breaking free from a chain gang. do he and his friends head for the mexican border from jail and safety. no they don\\'t because coburn has a mission of revenge. to kill the peace officer who brought him in and in the process killed his woman. that peace officer is charlton heston who is now retired and he knows what coburn is after. as he explains it to his daughter, barbara hershey, coburn was holed up in a shack and was involved in a waco like standoff. his indian woman was killed in the hail of bullets fired. it\\'s not something he\\'s proud of, she was a collateral casualty in a manhunt. lest we feel sorry for coburn he lets us know full well what an evil man he truly is. heston is his usual stalwart hero, but the acting honors in the last hard men go to james coburn. he blows everyone else off the screen when he\\'s on. coburn gets the bright idea of making sure heston trails him by kidnapping hershey and taking her to an indian reservation where the white authorities can\\'t touch him. he knows that heston has to make it personal then. coburn\\'s gang includes, morgan paull, thalmus rasulala, john quade, larry wilcox, and jorge rivero. heston has chris mitchum along who is his son-in-law to be. the last hard men is one nasty and brutal western. andrew mclaglen directed it and i\\'m thinking it may have been a project originally intended for sam peckinpaugh. it sure shows a lot of his influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate the violence. of which there is a lot. for a little peckinpaugh lite, the last hard men is your film. maybe it was the title, or the trailer (certainly not the interview on the dvd, which is with the director as he keeps saying \"hi, kids\" into the camera like a buffoon), but i had expectations for entrails of a virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal, bloody killings by a weird japanese penetrator. turns out it\\'s way too sleazy for its own good, or bad, or whatever. there\\'s a problem- and one can see this also in the italian sexploitation flick porno holocaust, similar to this in many respects- in not having balance to the sex and violence. too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno, and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies! and with the killing scenes, there has to be at least a little tack, and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity, in creating the creature/killer/whatever. entrails of a virgin has neither. it\\'s safe to say it\\'s a pretty soulless movie, even if isn\\'t one of the very worst ever made- it\\'s there just for horn-dog japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their \\'other\\' heads. in this case, we\\'re given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls, nothing too salacious, and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by \"a murderer\" as he\\'s credited. first off, the director kazuo \\'gaira\\' komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on- we get spliced in (or phoned in, take your pick) clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere. it looks like it\\'s from another movie. then once settled into the house, there\\'s a \\'wrestling\\' scene that\\'s poorly choreographed and shot (yeah, we really need to see him \\'all\\' there), and then on to the rape and killings. first the rape, by the photographers, who promise the girls some jobs for their time. then the murderer, who like d\\'amato\\'s creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial, and who for an unknown reason kills the men and/or rapes the women one by one. now, the latter of those, taken by themselves, should be considered the highlights of the movie. this is like saying, however, that the croã»tons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad. an eye-gouging scene, a spike thrown like an olympic event (that scene, actually, is kind of cool), and finally the entrailing of the overly sex-crazed girl, whose inconsequential name i can\\'t remember. even *this* becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title! on top of this, the sex scenes, which become tedious through \\'gaira\\' and his indulgence in long-takes-without-cutaways where everything by the japanese censors is blurred anyway, are dubbed over by the actors (you\\'d think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough, hence the need to let them \\'speak\\' for themselves). but the overall feeling from entrails of a virgin is that of a lumpy one, where it\\'s just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror (watch as the last girl left alive, the virgin of the picture, tries to stop the murderer from getting to her, which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him!) you just want it to be done with, for the \\'i hate women\\' mantra to ease up or be rid altogether. the few scenes that actually attempt a depiction of revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute boy scout troop meandering tentatively between swimming holes. when sharif or, please god, palance try their hand at fiery oratory, they sound like kurtz swallowing a bug. the displays of strategic brilliance incorporate a map of cuba replete with smiling fishies in the ocean, and a positively vaudevillian hypothesis on how the bay of pigs came to pass. what does that leave us with? one comical dentistry scene; a surfeit of uppity hollywood peasants who address the camera as though it were a moving train; and, just for kicks, a passel of homoeroticism that is not limited to castro\\'s manic and unremitting cigar-fellatio. never trust a medved, but even a busted clock is right twice a day: this is a historically awful movie. this film took me by surprise. i make it a habit of finding out as little as possible about films before attending because trailers and reviews provide spoiler after spoiler. all i knew upon entering the theater is that it was a documentary about a long married couple and that imdb readers gave it a 7.8, rotten tomatoes users ranked it at 7.9 and the critics averaged an amazing 8.2! if anything, they underrated this little gem. filmmaker doug block decided to record his parents \"for posterity\" and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interviews with his parents, outspoken mother mina, and less than forthcoming dad, mike. i immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker (mike & mina\\'s son doug) was going to take us. as a matter of fact, i doubt that doug himself knew where he was going with this! life takes unexpected twists and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey. it is difficult to verbalize just how moved i was with this story and the unique way in which it was told. absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is a must-see even if you aren\\'t a fan of the documentary genre. this film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten. \"51 birch street\" is one of those rare filmgoing experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you. the best news of all is that hbo had a hand in the production so instead of playing to a limited art house audience, eventually, millions of people will have a chance to view this incredible piece of work. bravo!!!!!!!! stephen hawkings is a genius. he is the king of geniuses. watching this movie makes me feel dumb. but it\\'s a great movie. not highly entertaining, but very very intriguing. the movie centers around wheelchair bound stephen hawkings, a man who makes einstein look average, and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe, time, the galaxy, and black holes. everyone at sometime or another during a really intense high comes to a moment when they think they\\'v got the universe and the cosmos figured out and they swear as soon as they sober up they\\'ll write it all down. well here is a man who actually held that feeling for more then six hours. here is a man who despite suffering from lou gehrig\\'s disease has become the greatest mind the world has yet seen. watch this and listen in on how he has formulated theories on black holes. awesome. you won\\'t be the same after you see it. the story is about a psychic woman, tory, who returns to her hometown and begins reliving her traumatic childhood past (the death of her childhood friend and abusive father). tory discovers that her friend was just the first in a string of murders that are still occurring. can her psychic powers help solve the crimes and stop the continuing murders? you really don\\'t need to find out because, oh my god! this was so so so so bad! i know all the nora roberts fans will flock to this movie and give it tons of 10\\'s. then the rest of us will see an imdb score of 6 and actually think this movie is worth watching. but do not be fooled. the ending was predictable, the acting terrible (don\\'t even get me started about the southern accents *y\\'all*) and the story was trite. just remember....you were warned! oh god, i must have seen this when i was only 11 or twelve, (don\\'t ask how) i may have been young, but i wasn\\'t stupid. anyone could see that this is a bad movie, nasty, gross, unscary and very silly. i\\'ve seen more impressive effects at disneyland, i\\'ve seen better performances at a school play, and i\\'ve seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo, where they do nothing but sit in the water, ignoring the children tapping on the glass. the story is set in northern australia. a handful of ambitious young people, are trying out a new water sport, surfing in shark filled waters. it soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water. after they learn what, they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman, who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family. i think i have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years, the best of which is lake placid, and the worse of which is its sequel. blood surf would have to be the second worst croc flick i think, with primeval and crocodile tailing closely behind. the australian saltwater crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there, resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year. movies like blood surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature, but a good hour and a half of the viewer\\'s life. unless you really want to see it, avoid blood surf. \"fate\" leads walter sparrow to come in possession of a mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life, all based around the number 23. as the story unfolds in real life and fiction, sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end. the number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution. the film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential. the screenplay was probably the worst part about it. it was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie. it seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea, he just didn\\'t know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time. the second half of the film was running low on ideas, the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful. joel schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with phone booth and a few other films but the number 23 reminds me that he\\'s still capable of making a stinker. he has the movie drenched in style but he just can\\'t get a good focus. he moves the film at a clunky and slow pace. he switches from reality to what\\'s actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying. the actual book in the film that\\'s titled \"the number 23\" is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears. when carrey is finally done with book, we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery. at this point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. we impatiently wait for the movie to reach it\\'s horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished. the acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable. jim carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn\\'t even seem to be trying. he was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden. his narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character. virginia madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts. logan lerman was pretty bland as was danny huston. overall, the number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills. rating 3/10 we brought this film as a joke for a friend, and could of been our worst joke to play. the film is barely watchable, and the acting is dire. the worst child actor ever used and hasslehoff giving a substandard performance. the plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on. it tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable. just terrible this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life!! it was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous!! and i have never seen such bad acting in my life! the only good part about the movie were all the hot guys(especially drew fuller). i don\\'t know what these people were thinking when they made this movie!! i didn\\'t even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves. i mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn! i would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch! i was very disappointed!! the whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion. this is a typical steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds. i wouldn\\'t call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a steele novel knows how they all end. if you don\\'t want to know much about the plot, don\\'t keep reading. gilbert\\'s character, ophelia, is a woman of french decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident. gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she, otherwise a good actress, cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent. brad johnson, also an excellent actor, is matt, who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce. he is gentle, convincing and compelling in this role. the two meet on the beach through her daughter, pip, and initially, ophelia accuses matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid. all of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love. the chemistry between the two leads is not great, even though the talent of these two people is not, in my opinion, a question. they did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical. two people meet, tragedy, bigger tragedy, a secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then they get together. i wish there was more to it than that, but there it is in a nutshell. i wanted mindless entertainment, and i got it with this. in regard to the genre of romantic films, this one fails to be memorable. \"a secret affair\" with janine turner is far superior (not a steele book), as are some of steele\\'s earlier books turned into film. oh noes one of these attack of the japanese ghost girl movies... i don\\'t even remember how many i\\'ve seen. maybe it sells... but not to me. not scary at all. the japanese horror movies are have been very similar since the first one of these... also the pulling of the kid. i have seen that pulled under scene so many times in so many horror movies. cellphone scene is also nothing new... the dramaticness of the guy getting hit by a train kinda sucked... i mean it lacked all dramaticness... ok this is for kids 14-16 who listen to japanese rock and think they are so unique... we\\'ll let me tell you. there\\'s a million of you =d this is one of them. 3/10 i\\'ve seen worse but you won\\'t be missing anything by not seeing this! nicholas walker is paul, the local town reverand who\\'s married to martha (ally sheedy), but also is a habitual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to run away with his current affair, veronica (dara tomanovich). however in so doing, he gets a bout of amnesia (hence the name of the film). sally kirkland is also on hand as a crazy old coot who pines for the good reverand in a shades of \"misery\" type of way. it\\'s sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this. not the least bit john savage in a horridly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator. in a film billed as a \\'black comedy\\', one has to bring both elements into said movie. while this does bring the former in spades, it sadly contains none of the latter. furthermore you can\\'t emphasize with any of the characters and as thus, have absolutely no vested interest in them. technically not an all-together bad movie just an extremely forgettable one. eye candy: dara tomanovich gets topless; sally kirkland also shows some skin my grade: c- where i saw it: showtime showcase hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world. it only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap re-invented over and over again. take superheroes for example, for each x-man and spiderman, there are daredevil, elektra, ghost rider and hulk. japanese horror remakes are even worst. it only took the ring, which was pitch-perfect (mostly because of mr. gore verbinsky), to bring a ton of look-alike creepy-woman based horrors, e.g. the ring 2, the eye, dark water (which was fine, but pointless), and the grudges. the first grudge wasn\\'t entirely bad. it was scary most of the way, which is what one could expect from it. plus, the plot had some brains mixing narratives. grudge 2 is exactly like the previous; this could be a good thing, but hey, what boy men in black ii? was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain? for the grudge 2, the critic goes the same way. tired scares, bad acting (except for amber tamblyn), and clichã©s all over the place. three stories take place, on different places and time. there is aubrey (tamblyn) investigating what drove her sister karen (sarah michelle gellar) to death; allison (arielle kebbel) who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place; and finally, an american family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door. glad to say (and i mean it) that everything is tied up at the end, but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture, when everything else is simply tiresome and dull. the chills are all over there, a girl alone in the lockers, someone who shouldn\\'t enter a house, others that dig too deep. meanwhile, ghosts keep killing and killing and killing, which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the ebola epidemic. hey, doesn\\'t that seem just like another bad japanese remake, something called pulse? yeah, day after day it\\'s getting easier to hold a grudge... against hollywood bullshits. \"down periscope\" has been in our library since it first arrived in vhs. since then, we have acquired the dvd and a digital from cinema now. it is a quirky flick that does not go militarily overboard as either pro or con. it is first and foremost a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters, i am quite surprised that a sequel has never been offered. the movie has gained a following that borders on a cult obsession, even among the very young. i became aware of this while visiting the uss drum in mobile, alabama in 2002. a group of cub scouts, my grandson among them, had all taken up the roles from the movie and planned to relive it during their overnighter on board. it is a fun romp that makes you proud both of our navy and hollywood... which is rare company. thanks to kelsey grammar, lauren holly and rob schneider for making what could have been an otherwise unremarkable movie, such great entertainment! if you came here, it\\'s because you\\'ve already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it. i feel for you, i *really* do. and i profusely apologize as a canadian (because that\\'s what we do) that this film ever had to cross your eyes, if only for a moment. i hear there is no cure for the retinal bleeding reported out of every dozen cases. i, like everyone else, rented this movie believing it to be some stupid b-movie ripoff of blade. i thought, \"sure i could use a good laugh at a stupid movie.\" i\\'ll give the creators of this film one positive comment about their \\'creation\\': thanks for removing the rec xx/xx/xx from the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. i can see how that would have been a distraction from seeing this movie. and for the record, i *saw* the movie, but did not watch it. the dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmother\\'s trailer, i swear to god. you know what? i\\'m not writing anymore about this. it\\'s just too painful. deanna durbin, nan grey and barbara read are \"three smart girls\" in this universal film from 1936, which introduces deanna durbin to film audiences. it also stars ray milland, mischa auer, charles winninger, john king, binnie barnes and alice brady. it\\'s a sweet story about three young women, now living in switzerland with their divorced mother, who hear their father (winninger) is marrying again. not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him, they board a ship to america, with the help of the housekeeper/nanny, determined to stop the wedding. realizing that the intended, called \"precious\" (barnes) is nothing but a gold-digger aided and abetted by her mother (brady), they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy count. this is arranged by their father\\'s accountant (king). the man he chooses is a full-time drunk (auer), but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count (milland). what a mess. this is a delightful film, not cloying or overly sugary at all, with some nice performances, particularly by auer, milland, barnes and brady. the young women are pretty and all do good work. the emphasis, of course, is on young durbin, who is a natural actress and a beautifully-trained singer. in fact, her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult - she has no trouble with the high notes, as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice. she sings a delightful \"il bacio\" in a police station. one of the nicest things about the film is to see the father, played by charles winninger, not want his children around - until he sees them and gets to know them. barnes as the gold-digger isn\\'t all that young, but the girls\\' mother looks way up there, so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger, more glamorous woman. in fact, he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters. universal gives durbin the big star buildup here - she has the final shot in the movie. ray milland at this point was still paying his dues, and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is. very entertaining and of course, this led to a sequel and big stardom for deanna. if anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to, with conversation, character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new, better and different, those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing, directing, and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in italy and england. other days, other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment, made in 1992 with alfred molina, joan plowright, polly walker, josie lawrence, jim broadbent, miranda richardson, and michael kitchens in the major roles. under the brush stroke direction of mike newell, these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter\\'s eye. reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century, this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character, and the viewer, too. an artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us. i watched this series out of curiosity,wanting to see if they could possibly and with all this modern technology,out do cecil b. demille\\'s classic epic of 1956, starring charleton heston,yul brenner and sir cedric hardwicke. of course, i was let down. yes, they had all the biblical characters correct, but they didn\\'t give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes, that held your interest throughout the first movie. if you going to have a mini-series, you have to have some \"rivoting\" scenes, the \"burning bush\", parting the \"red sea\",drowning \"pharohs armies\", \"building sethi\\'s pyramids\", could have been done with todays\\' technology on the scale of blockbuster movies such as \"lord of the rings\" or the matrix. obviously, they didn\\'t want to leave a lasting impression of \"faith and sacrifice\", which is much needed in these trouble times. daniel day-lewis is the most versatile actor alive. english aristocratic snob in a room with a view, passionate irish thief in in the name of the father, an impudent, violent butcher in gangs of new york (in a performance ten times stronger than adrian brody\\'s in the pianist) and as the outrageous cristy brown with cerebral palsy in my left foot (just to name a few). his roles all influence eachother, but each is seperate, and utterly unique. he changes completely, with each character he takes on. and i\\'m beginning to believe that he can act as anything. anything. as cristy brown he is stunning. he does not ridicule the character, and he does not pity the character. a difficult achievement. and cristy brown comes to life. a smart man. an outrageous man. human. this movie, despite small scene-transition faults and the like, is an inspiration. yes, it\\'s predictable. but is it stupidly sentimental? no. i laughed. i cried. not a single moment of cheese. proof that this isn\\'t a hollywood movie. my favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant, when cristy is discussing painters with eileen, peter and her friends. here\\'s where daniel day-lewis reaches an acting climax. \"i\\'ll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that\\'s animated.\" \"wheel out the cripple!\" and his performance never slows down, never falters, and is beautiful. simply. he has a lot of screen time here. i watch it again again, and i never get tired of cristy\\'s perspicacious eyes, twitching and guttural speeches. a must-see. fo sho, yo! my guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts, and thus at least a quarter longer, because otherwise how can one explain its confused, abbreviated storyline. i was never completely lost, but i was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation. the movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slot. if it were longer, it might make more sense, but it still wouldn\\'t be much good. the movie\\'s most interesting idea is of the war between zeus and hera as being a war between the male and female, but the movie drops the ball on this, making hera\\'s followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what zeus\\' followers do or believe. the movie is also interesting because you don\\'t see the gods and there\\'s no real certainty that they exist. so it\\'s got a couple of intriguing ideas, but it doesn\\'t do anything useful with them. bad dialog, cardboard characters, and one interesting scene involving hercules and his three antagonistic sons. not unwatchable but also not worth watching. well, i like to watch bad horror b-movies, cause i think it\\'s interesting to see stupidity and unability of creators to shoot seriously good movie. (i always compare this movies to - for example - some spielberg\\'s works and again-and-again don\\'t understand the huge difference in what i see.) i like ed wood\\'s movies cause it\\'s so inept it\\'s very funny. but people!!! \"the chilling\" is not funny and is not even \"interesting\". it\\'s extremely boring horror movie without anything what makes even bad movies watchable. there\\'s no acting, no screenplay, no direction, no thrills and not even blood. it\\'s extremely inept amateurish film. it\\'s definitely the worst movie i had ever seen (and i had seen a lot of \"worst movies\" - believe me). i warned you !!! 1/10 this is the worst movie i have ever seen, as well as, the worst that i will probably ever see. i see no need to rehash what all the others have said previously, just be forewarned... this is not one of those bad movies you think you want to watch because you want to be able to make fun of it, its just plain bad bad bad bad bad. this movie is the equivalent to having a \"pet rock\" as your friend. you wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen. unfortunately, it never does. at least with a pet rock you knew what you were getting into. lion\\'s gate completely deceives on this bombshell... no...this is a disaster. after watching this film, you would swear george w. bush had his hands all over the making of this film... yes its that idiotic. stay away, unless of course you just want to watch the worst movie of all time. its probably how lion\\'s gate figured it would make some money off this piece of tripe. i have been a mario fan for as long as i can remember, i have very fond memories of playing super mario world as a kid, this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new. super mario galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing mario franchise. there is much very different about this game from any other mario before it, while still keeping intact the greatest elements of mario, the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space. the story begins much like any other mario game, mario receives a letter from princess peach inviting him to a celebration at her castle in the mushroom kingdom. upon arriving at peach\\'s castle mario finds bowser and his son (bowser jr.) attacking the castle with their airships. bowser kidnaps princess peach and then lifts her castle up into space. in the midst of the castle being lifted into space mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet. mario is found by a talking star named luma and is taken back to the luma\\'s home, a floating space station, here mario meets many other lumas and also meets their leader, a woman named rosalina. rosalina tells mario that bowser has taken away the space station\\'s power stars and scattered them across the universe, it is up to mario to help the lumas find them and save peach, thus the adventure begins. the way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies, each galaxy consists of multiple planets that mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the power stars. mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity, some planets are small and others are big, many planets are similar to classic mario environments. the best thing about the game are the controls, all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same, but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game. you shake the remote mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game, and it will as well activate the shooting stars. you can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment. then there is the graphics, these are by far the best graphics on the wii, it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks, you could probably almost say it looks as good as some 360 games. my only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to, and also the story is pretty weak. the worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game, no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at 4 lives. still these minor problems aside it\\'s a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging. this is the type of game that we\\'ve been waiting for on the wii. a perfect 10 out of 10! this short film that inspired the soon-to-be full length feature - spatula madness - is a hilarious piece that contends against similar cartoons yielding multiple writers. the short film stars edward the spatula who after being fired from his job, joins in the fight against the evil spoons. this premise allows for some funny content near the beginning, but is barely present for the remainder of the feature. this film\\'s 15-minute running time is absorbed by some odd-ball comedy and a small musical number. unfortunately not much else lies below it. the plot that is set up doesn\\'t really have time to show. but it\\'s surely follows it plot better than many high-budget hollywood films. this film is worth watching at least a few times. take it for what it is, and don\\'t expect a deep story. okay, last night, august 18th, 2004, i had the distinct displeasure of meeting mr. van bebble at a showing of the film the manson family at the three penny in chicago as part of the chicago underground film festival. here\\'s what i have to say about it. first of all, the film is an obvious rip off of every kenneth anger, roman polanski, oliver stone and terry gilliam movie i\\'ve ever seen. second of all, in a short q & a session after the show mr. van bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual manson family members or charlie himself, calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them, that the film was based on his (van bebble\\'s) take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on tv and in the news (and i\\'m assuming from the autobiography and the book helter skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative). so i had second dibs on questions, i asked if he was trying to present the outsider, mtv, sex drugs and rock \\'n roll version and not necessarily the true story. this question obviously pissed off the by now sloshed director who started shouting \"f*** you, shut the f*** up, this is the truth! all those other movies are bullsh**!\" well anyway, i didn\\'t even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when i read the tagline for the film, \"you\\'ve heard the laws side of the story...now hear the story as it is told by the manson family.\" excuse me, if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers them to be liars that he doesn\\'t want to have anything to do with, how in god\\'s name can he tell the story for them!? this is the most ridiculous statement i have ever heard! the film was obviously catered to the sex drugs and rock \\'n roll audience that it had no trouble in attracting to the small, dimly lit theatre, and was even more obviously spawned by the sex drugs and rock \\'n roll mind of a man who couldn\\'t even watch his own film without getting up every ten minutes to go get more beer or to shout some sort of rocky horroresque call line to the actors on screen. this film accomplishes little more than warping the public\\'s image of actual events (which helped shape the state of america and much of the world today) into some sort of slasher/comic book/porno/rape fantasy dreamed up by an obviously shallow individual. the film was definitely very impressive to look at. the soundtrack was refreshing as it contained actual samples of charlie\\'s work with the family off of his lie album. the editing was nice and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music videos. all in all this film would have made a much better addition to the catalogues at mtv than to the underground film festival or for that matter the minds of any intellectual observers. i felt like i was at a midnight rocky horror viewing the way the audience was dressed and behaving (probably the best part of the experience). the cast was very good with the exception of charlie who resembled some sort of stoned dungeons and dragons enthusiast more than the actual role he was portraying. the descriptions the film gave of him as full of energy, throwing ten things at you and being very physical about it all the while did not match at all the slow, lethargic, and chubby representation that was actually presented. all in all the film basically explains itself as sadie (or maybe it was linda) declares at the end, \"you can write a bunch of bullsh** books or make a bunch of bullsh** movies...etc. etc.\" case in point. even the disclaimer \"based on a true story\" is a dead giveaway, signalling that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and has made a difference in the world. all you have to do is a little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the the crap, or actually, maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book instead. all i can say is this, when the film ended i got a free beer so i\\'m glad i went, but not so glad i spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to shut the f*** up for asking the director a question. peace. i bought this game on an impulse buy from walmart. i am glad i did. it was very entertaining listening to sean connery and playing the game. i thought the graphics were the best i have ever seen in a movie/game remake. the bonus levels were very hard! the sniper one i think was too hard, it made me so frustrated i didn\\'t play the game for a week and a half. there were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it. the only thing i might change was the upgrade system. i didn\\'t notice any difference from un-upgraded equipment to the upgraded, such as buying an armor upgrade didn\\'t seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life meter. i really liked the q copter. i think the developers did a good job. no, this hilariously horrible 70\\'s made-for-tv horror clinker isn\\'t about a deadly demonically possessed dessert cake. still, this exceptionally awful, yet undeniably amusing and thus enjoyable cathode ray refuse reaches a breathtaking apex of absolute, unremitting silliness and atrociousness that\\'s quite tasty in a so-execrable-it\\'s-downright-awesome sort of way. richard crenna, looking haggard and possibly inebriated, and yvette mimieux, who acts as if she never got over the brutal rape she endured in \"jackson county jail,\" sluggishly portray a disgustingly nice and respectable suburbanite couple whose quaint, dull, sleepy small town existence gets ripped asunder when the cute german shepard they take in as the family pet turns out to be some ancient lethal evil spirit. pretty soon mimieux and her two repellently cutesy kids kim richards and ike eisenmann (the psychic alien moppets from the disney \"witch mountain\" pictures) are worshiping a crude crayon drawing of the nasty, ugly canine entity in the den. boy, now doesn\\'t that sound really scary and disturbing? well, scary and disturbing this laughably ludicrous claptrap sure ain\\'t, but it sure is funny, thanks to curtis (\"night tide\") harrington\\'s hopelessly weak direction, cartoonish (not so) special effects, an almost painfully risible\\'n\\'ridiculous plot, and a game cast that struggles valiantly with the absurd story (besides the leads, both martine beswicke and r.g. armstrong briefly pop up as members of a satanic cult and victor jory has a nice cameo as a helpful native american shaman). favorite scene: the malicious mephestophelion mutt puts the whammy on crenna, practically forcing him to stick his hand into a wildly spinning lawnmower blade. while stuck-up snobby fright film fans may hold their noses at the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly smelly schlock, devout tv trash lovers should deem this endearingly abominable offal the boob tube equivalent to alpo. it is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen, and who will die. it is about 4 women and a man who on a vacation. this was made during the end of the ultra nazi seventies, when blonde women were supposedly ultra american survivors and brunettes were all deserving of death. this movie, like the others of that era, contrives to bring this about, and the viewer knows this. there is no mystery or suspense. the people squabble, but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of the time, it is laughable. the five people happen upon two savage young characters, and go nuts. everyone is nuts, so that the director-writer team can justify their nazi propaganda. for some reason, the guy is attracted to the blonde, who is really not much to look at, and ignores a super hot looking brunette that any heterosexual man would go nuts over. one must remember that in the seventies, movies were meant to appeal to women and not men. totally crap and totally depressing. marion davies stars in this remarkable comedy \"show people\" released by mgm in 1928. davies plays a hick from savannah, georgia, who arrives in hollywood with her father (dell henderson). the jalopy they arrive in is a hoot - as is davies outrageous southern costume. davies lands a job in slapstick comedy, not what she wants, but it brings her success. she meets fellow slapstick star william haines, who is immediately smitten with her. well, davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio (\"high art studios\") and lands a job in stuffy period pieces. a handsome but fake actor (andre telefair) shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious hollywood star. davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life, but of course learns that is not who she really is. marion davies is wonderful throughout, as she - outrageously - runs the gamut of emotions required of a \"serious\" actress. william haines is his usual wonderful comedic self, and there are cameos by charles chaplin, john gilbert, and other famous stars of the day, including the director of the film, king vidor. this is a silent film with a few \"sound effects\" as sound pictures were just coming into their own. a treasure of a film. the performance of every actor and actress (in the film) are excellently natural which is what movie acting should be; and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that i am never tired of seeing it over and over again. however, i am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors\\' and director, attenborough\\'s credits that puzzles me: aren\\'t they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent, long lasting film for the audience? i am hoping i would get some answers to my puzzles from some one (possibly one of the \"knowledgeable\" personnel (insider) of the film. while star trek the motion picture was mostly boring, star trek the final frontier is plain bad. in this terrible sequel, the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the federation that ambassadors representing earth, romulus and kronos (the klingon home world) have been kidnapped by a renegade vulcan bent on his quest to attain a starship to venture into the great barrier. there, he hopes to find god. using mysticism and bad writing, he persuades many of the senior officers of the enterprise to betray kirk and get a hold of the ship. they do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a god-like alien. this one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin. at the core is a good idea that is never really developed. the plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before. it is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco. the action scenes don\\'t have the suspense of wrath of kahn, the philosophy is boring, and the humor is stale. now i will focus most of my anger on william shatner. when he takes the director\\'s chair, the ego gets bigger. most of the focus is on him, spock, and mccoy, but does not give the others enough to do. moreover, whereas shatner is usually guilty of over-acting in previous movies and television spots, he is just plain bad in this one. now kirk is reckless, a practical jokers, and silly. one of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song, \"row row row your boat\" in a round by a campfire. in any case, this is the worst of the star trek franchise. i should have given it three out of ten instead of five. despite later claims, this early-talkie melodrama has very little in common with \"citizen kane\": it\\'s a biopic of a ruthless but human fictional plutocrat, told in flashback but hopping around time. the scriptwriter, preston sturges, shows none of his later gift for sparkling dialog, and none of the myriad cinematic innovations of \"kane\" are evident. still, it\\'s very watchable, with a young spencer tracy (his old-man makeup makes him look just like, well, an old spencer tracy) showing depth and authority, and colleen moore -- a little past her prime, and not physically well matched -- playing a multifaceted woman-behind-the-man. there\\'s also helen vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in movie history, sending the final third into ecstatic soap-opera reverberations. the surviving print is jumpy and has missing audio snippets, and there are some plot holes left open (how would she know whose son it was if she\\'s sleeping with both of them?), and the music is awfully hokey. for all that, i was quite fascinated. this is the best version (so far) that you will see and the most true to the bronte work. dalton is a little tough to imagine as rochester who jane eyre declared \"not handsome\". but his acting overcomes this and zelah clark, pretty as she is, is also a complete and believable jane eyre. this production is a lengthy watch but well worth it. nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true \\'romance\\' in literature, this is the way to see it. i own every copy of this movie and have read and re-read the original. the filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this. apparently, the people that wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this so-called \"movie.\" they described \"blindingly choreographed intrigue and violence.\" i saw no \"intrigue.\" i instead saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie. i saw no \"violence.\" at least, i saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief as to what could possibly hurt a man with \"impervious\" skin--but here i am perhaps revealing too much of the \"plot.\" furthermore, as a viewer of many and sundry films (some of which include the occasional kung fu movie), i can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unwatchable. whatever you may choose to do, i will always remain correct, jonathan tanner p.s. i was not blinded by the choreography. i liked boyle\\'s performance, but that\\'s about the only positive thing i can say. everything was overdone to the point of absurdity. most of the actors spoke like you would expect your 9-year-old nephew to speak if he were pretending to be a jaded, stone-hearted cop, or an ultra-evil villain. the raspy voice-overs seemed amateurish to me. i could go buy a cheap synthesizer and crank out better opening music. and what\\'s with the whole 1984ish police torture stuff? it was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story. cox added a lot of things, in fact, that he apparently thought would be really cool, but had nothing to do with the story. that\\'s a big disappointment because one of the things that makes borges\\' stories so good is his minimalism -- they are tightly bound, with no superfluous details. this movie is just the opposite. i stopped watching after the scene where lonnrot is questioning the guy from the yidische zaitung, or thereabouts. i wasted $4 renting this, but at least i can get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully saving others from making the same mistake. it\\'s terrific when a funny movie doesn\\'t make smile you. what a pity!! this film is very boring and so long. it\\'s simply painfull. the story is staggering without goal and no fun. you feel better when it\\'s finished. so well made, no cgi crap. has anyone else been on the \"jumping crocs\" tour of darwin\\'s adelaide river before? black water was way realistic; rogue was a bit cringeworthy. thought the blonde chick was excellent in it - haven\\'t really seen her before. and the other chick is a babe, she is always excellent. v. suspenseful - i would compare it to jaws over any other man eating animal flick. got the hole aussie thing down pat without going ott with struths and crikeys, as well. loved it! the assignment is an outstanding thriller with several plot twists driven by character, rather than star turns, the need to stage special effects, obligatory romance, and endless car chases. however, there is a car chase in here, and a dandy it is. aidan quinn is wonderful as both the terrorist and the naval officer \"recruited\" to eliminate him. it is rare that a second or third tier actor, such as quinn, is given an important starring role like this that carries a film. usually, such a role is given to an a-list actor with box office draw, which is probably why i never heard of this film before i saw it. donald sutherland is great as the morally ambiguous, somewhat creepy at times, agent that recruits quinn. ben kingsley is fine also as the israeli agent. the plot is very complex and there are multiple story lines, which converge in gradual fashion toward the end, and not all at once as we\\'re used to seeing. the paranoia and claustrophobia of these type of thrillers is captured and portrayed with both moral ambiguity and frightening intensity. the locations are convincing and effective. the soundtrack is nothing special, but rarely do we get all of the above mentioned qualities these days, without dumb and/or meaningless plot developments; unconvincing star turns; loud, annoying, music video type soundtracks; a villain that hams it up; and repeatedly a cast, costumes, and plot that cater mostly to an audience under 25. this is an outstanding thriller, which most assuredly did not get its just due upon its release. ***1/2 of 4 stars. this is one of the finest movies i have ever seen....the stark scenery...the isolation...the ignorant bigoted people hiding behind their religion...a backdrop for some wordliness and sophistication...the acting is completely natural...but for me as a\"foodie\\' the best is the actual choosing and preparation of the feast..i have spent time in paris and know the cuisine well...whether or not the cafe anglais really exists i don\\'t know but i do know of similar establishments and babette\\'s menu and choice of wines are authentic...and of course the end where despite themselves the perfect meal mellows them back to friendship is the only ending there could be..this is a 10 out of 10 film and should be seen by anyone with enough brain and taste to understand it set in the 1794, the second year of the french republic formed after the execution of louis xvi, this film portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders danton (gerard depardieu, at his finest) and robespierre (a commanding performance by the polish actor wojciech pszoniak). the moderate revolutionary danton has returned to paris from his country seat where he has been since being deposed as leader of the committee of public safety in the previous year by robespierre. he is opposed to \"the reign of terror\" which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens, mainly by guillotine, who are thought to be opposed to the revolution. danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade robespierre to curb the bloodletting. but robespierre and the committee are afraid that the popularity of danton will lead to them being overthrown, and put danton and his supporters on trial for being traitors. this was the first french language film made by andrzej wajda after he had arrived in france from poland. his polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the solidarity trade union, which had opposed the polish government in the late seventies and early eighties. his previous film \"man of iron\" (1981) had dealt with the solidarity union and its leader lech walesa, and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of walesa and the polish leader general jaruselski, and that between danton and robespierre. danton/walesa are the voice of reason opposed to robespierre/jaruselski who continue dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent. the film is based on the polish play \"the danton affair\" written by stanislawa przybyszewska in the 1930s, and on its release the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical. but what the film does is to concentrate on the behind-the-scenes meetings of the committees and the scenes in the national assembly and the courtroom rather than the activities on the streets of paris. usually i\\'m a bit of a fan of the bad eighties & early nineties film featuring now has beens...but this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through. guys dressing up as girls has been done to death - but never so pathetically. corey haim\\'s performance was abysmal as usual, nicole eggert was not much better. this has no redeeming qualities, even if you are a number #1 fan of an actor/actress in this piece of trash - stay away! i have now seen quite a few films by pedro almodã³var, but this would have to be the most disappointing so far. this film seemed to lack the zaniness that is usually everywhere in his films, and the story just never got me interested. many almodã³var regulars appear in this film, so it\\'s not like there was a lack of on-screen talent, but this film just seemed more serious than his other films. if there was a comedic edge to this movie, i certainly couldn\\'t find it, and it made for one surprisingly weak movie. i greatly enjoyed margaret atwood\\'s novel \\'the robber bride\\', and i was thrilled to see there was a movie version. a woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder, and his buddy, an ex-cop journalist, tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead woman\\'s crazy female friends. it\\'s fortunate that the movie script fixes ms. atwood\\'s clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men, victims of scheming women... heh. okay, you got me. if these guys are mentioned in the book, and i\\'m pretty sure they\\'re entirely made up for the movie, i\\'ll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy. apparently, the three main female characters of the novel aren\\'t enough to carry the movie. zenia\\'s manipulations aren\\'t interesting unless we see them happen to a man, and a man\\'s life is screwed up. roz, charis, and toni tell their stories -- to a man. because it\\'s not important if a man doesn\\'t hear them. i liked the characters in the book. it hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a man\\'s story. i normally do not look for feminist angles on media, and i tried to enjoy the movie as is. if i hadn\\'t read the book, i might have enjoyed the movie a lot more. so if you like the cop and the ex-cop, and you want to read more about them, you\\'re out of luck. read the novel, if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot. it\\'s the same plot: the movie excavated it, ironed it, and sprinkled it with male angst. it\\'s like zenia\\'s revenge on margaret atwood. this movie gets a 10 because there is a lot of gore in it.who cares about the plot or the acting.this is an italian horror movie people so you know you can\\'t expect much from the acting or the plot.everybody knows fulci took footage from other movies and added it to this one.since i never seen any of the movies that he took footage from it didn\\'t matter to me.the italian godfather of gore out done himself with this movie.this is one of the goriest italian movies you will ever see.no gore hound should be without this movie in their horror movie collection.buy this movie no matter what it is a horehounds dream come true. ingrid bergman, playing dentist walter matthau\\'s faithful receptionist who harbors a little crush on her boss, is absolutely wonderful in this film. she handles the witty repartee in the script with aplomb and steals a terrific scene where she and goldie hawn talk in a record booth (ingrid\\'s monologue is a front, but her face tells you she believes in it with all her heart). matthau is an odd choice for the leading man (he\\'s too old for goldie hawn and too unrefined for bergman, not to mention too unfocused to be a dentist), but i liked the way he tries hard to please goldie and stumbles around trying to free himself from a lie. hawn (who won a supporting oscar) is just as fresh and bubbly as she is today. this bedroom farce isn\\'t terribly sophisticated (and faintly reminds one of \"any wednesday\" besides), but it\\'s a welcome relief from the noisy, teen-oriented comedies they turn out today. \"cactus flower\" is a lovely sigh! *** from **** \"a bored television director is introduced to the black arts and astral projection by his girlfriend. learning the ability to separate his spirit from his body, the man finds a renewed interest in his life and a sense of wellbeing. unfortunately, the man discovers while he is sleeping, his spirit leaves his body and his uncontrolled body roams the streets in a murderous rampage,\" according to the dvd sleeve\\'s synopsis. the synopsis isn\\'t entirely correct, as it turns out. anyway, the movie opens with a dizzying \"out-of-body\" example of handsome director winston rekert (as paul sharpe)\\'s newly discovered \"astral body\" experience; it also foreshadows an upcoming dogfight. young andrew bednarski (as matthew sharpe), being a kid, draws pictures of \"the blue man\", as his murder spree begins. handsome detective john novak (as stewart kaufman) discovers the victims are connected to mr. rekert. mr. novak\\'s investigation leads to the supernatural; a prime example of which is karen black (as janus), with whom rekert fears he is falling in love. several in the cast perform well; but, \"the blue man\" winds up tying itself up in a knot. aka \"eternal evil\", its unsatisfying story tries to be far too clever for its own good. ah yes the 1980s , a time of reaganomics and sly , chuck and a host of other action stars hiding in a remote jungle blowing away commies . at the time i couldn`t believe how movies like rambo , missing in action and uncommon valor ( and who can forget the ridiculous red dawn ? ) made money at the box office , they`re turgid action crap fests with a rather off putting right wing agenda and they have dated very badly . troma`s war is a tongue in cheek take on these type of movies but you`ve got to ask yourself did they need spoofing in the first place ? of course not . troma`s war lacks any sort of sophistication - though it does make the point that there`s no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wing ones - and sometimes feels more like a grade z movie than a send up . maybe it is ? this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces (\"the fall of the house of usher\", \"dance of death\" (poem) ) is actually quite creepy from beginning to end. it is similar to some of the old black-and-white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house (for example, \"the cat and the canary\", \"the old dark house\", \"night of terror\" and so on). boris karloff plays a demented inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize the guests. he dies early in the film (or does he ? ) and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences. i won\\'t go into too much detail here, but it is definitely a must-see for fans of old dark house mysteries. watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room. dan basinger 8/10 i am so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie! jack frost was my introduction into the films produced and distributed by a-pix entertainment, and without exception, everything this company deals with is pure crap! first, and this is very important, never ever watch this movie sober! why would you? unlike many other entertaingly bad movies, this one i feel was made intentionally bad. i just can\\'t get over how fake the snowman is, which is why its always shown only briefly, the way it moves is the best! this movie is waaaaaaaaaaay better than the michael keaton piece of crap, becuz that was made too be a good movie, and that version is as bad as this. \"revolt of the zombies\" proves that having the same director revamp and recycle an idea doesn\\'t necessarily make lightning strike twice. the halperin brothers, responsible for the horror classic \"white zombie\", made this trite piece of garbage a mere few years later to cash in on its popularity and even recycled close-ups of lugosi\\'s eyes from that previous film. there was a court battle with the \"white zombie\" film\\'s rights owners, who didn\\'t want the halperins to be able to use the word \\'zombie\\' in this title. that word was the only thing that could help this film, because, as everyone knows, bad films can make much more money simply by having the word \\'zombie\\' appear in the title. knowing what victor halperin was capable of a few years before only makes this uninteresting film more insulting. it seems he never directed another horror film after this debacle. the zombies here seem not to be true walking dead, but simply hypnotism victims. wanna create a mind-controlled army of zombies? be ready to crack a few eggs, including your own. the lame plot: man falls in love with scheming woman who plays with his heart and becomes engaged to him only to make his friend, whom she loves, jealous. this sends man into a spiral of madness in which he tries using zombie mind-control techniques to change things to his advantage in an attempt to win over a woman who isn\\'t worth spit. this includes one of the most blatantly obvious plot developments i\\'ve ever seen. you\\'d have to be blind or stupid not to see the ending coming. the acting isn\\'t even good. this movie makes the racially insensitive \"king of the zombies\" (which appeared on the same double bill dvd i bought) seems like an atmospheric horror masterpiece by comparison and reminds us that not every black and white film is a classic. it makes the atomic age sci-fi alien zombie cheese fest \"invisible invaders\" seem like a serious drama. this is one big ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic it could probably make many a korean film fan twitch (south korean films are often known for their use of melodrama). the credits list the ironically named company favorite films. i\\'m not sure whose favorite film this would be, but they\\'re obviously an idiot. not recommended for fans of: zombies, romance, or classic films. the complaints are valid, to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women. i am okay with these night time soaps, like grey\\'s anatomy, or ugly betty, or west wing, because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end. however, when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men (taye diggs, tim daly, and chris lowell) into sexual tension and romps, and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called little hospital, it seems like general hospital...or a female counterpart to baywatch. that was what men wanted and they had it, so if this is what women want so be it, but the idea that this is a high brow show (or something men will watch) is unrealistic. this movie was one of the best movies that i have seen this year. i didn\\'t see any cameos in the movie, but it is still pretty good. it is similar to anchorman in the humor department, but i think this is a better put together movie. it actually has a point. if you are going to see a whole bunch of t&a you will be disappointed. just a well put together movie!!!! if you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor, you will find this to be a really good movie. i definitely think that ebert and roeper\\'s review of this movie is right on. i mean, i don\\'t really like ebert on most movies, but this is the movie that i will agree about. the movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there. there is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie. yea, sure, you get laughed at when it is found out about, but it still suggests that you wait. steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet, it is still funny. i remember seeing this film in the mid 80\\'s thought it a well paced and well acted piece. i now work quite often in berkeley square and the had to get a copy of dvd to remind myself how little the area has changed, although my office is newish it just 30 seconds away from \"the bank\". even jack barclays car dealership is still there selling bentleys and rolls royces. it\\'s look like the dvd is due a region 2 release soon. the region 1 copy i is very poor quality. let\\'s hope they\\'ve cleaned it up. only the slightly dodgy escape sequence from the court spoils what would otherwise be a great film but i guess is in line with the caper tag the film goes with. two hours ago i was watching this brilliant movie which overwhelmed me with its imprisoning photography. it is quite understandable how it won the prize of best camera in cannes 2000. close ups predominated it. close ups of walls, humans and of many other things. the warm colored lighting (which is also usually by the director) gave the movie a warm atmosphere. only two persons are principally to be seen in most of it. an interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the movie nearly all the time. each one of these themes represented a certain atmosphere during the whole movie. silence and slow movements characterize the movie. some scenes were extended moments or a serious of close-ups. not only tony leung deserves a prize for his superb acting since maggie cheung was also so brilliant. i wonder how many dresses she was wearing in the different scenes. the story was also connected somehow with the history of hong kong and the region the 1960s. this prevented me from understanding some details of the it especially at the end. in short i would recommend the fans of artistic movies to watch it in the cinema. luckily for bill murray this is such a light-weight project since he pretty much has to carry it. meatballs is the story of low-rent camp northstar and how its counselors deal with the campers as well as one another. then there is much made of their wealthy rivals from across the lake named camp mohawk which culminates in a two-day olympiad competition. above it all is bill murray clowning around and making a pretty memorable film debut. the film is sprinkled with medium-sized laughs, chuckles, and more than a few guffaws along the way. the biggest laughs come from the pranks played on the nerdy camp director. three of them involve the counselors moving his bed outside in various locations while he\\'s sleeping. morty, or \"micky\" as everyone calls him, wakes up along the side of a road, strung up in some trees several feet above the ground, and finally floating on a raft in the middle of the lake! there are also some funny moments involving the counselors hitting on one another, but this is a pg rated film with little in the way of raunchiness. the film takes a serious note involving a shy camper named rudy who is played by chris makepeace. of course it\\'s up to murray to teach the kid how to open up, and give him the confidence he needs to run a marathon during the olympiad. the sentimentality of rudy\\'s situation seems tacked on to a great degree. notice how when murray first sees the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he tells him, \"you must be the short depressed kid we ordered.\" makes you wonder if that line was really in the script or murray was just ad-libbing while the cameras were rolling. in other words, murray might as well have said to makepeace, \"you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp films who doesn\\'t fit in.\" but before it\\'s all over, murray\\'s performance makes this plot device more than bearable. he really seems to have some good chemistry with makepeace. the film culminates with the games between the two rival camps. very little of the events we are shown are even slightly believable, but \"it just doesn\\'t matter\". this is a pretty good film on many levels. don\\'t let the absurd 5.6 rating this film is currently getting scare you off. murray will keep you laughing throughout. just be warned..... avoid the sequels!!!! especially the one with corey feldman!! 8 of 10 stars. the hound. \"the danish bladerunner\" is boldly stated on the box. are you kidding me?! this film is a complete drag. when i\\'m thirsty and go for a soda in the kitchen, i usually pause the vcr, so i won\\'t miss anything. not this time. i actually found myself looking long and hard in the fridge, just so i wouldn\\'t have to go back. why the hell is there not one sciencefiction-scriptwriter out there who has the vaguest clue about how computers work? it\\'s mindboggling. one of the premises of film, is that our hero (who\\'s a hacker), has a little computerassistant to help him (the microsoft office paperclip finally caught on in the future). when he loses the assistant in the movie, he\\'s helpless and can\\'t get into any computers. he\\'s a hacker! it\\'s like saying, that you can\\'t drive your car, if you don\\'t have your lucky \"driving-cap\" on. i won\\'t even go into the lightning-effect when he recieves electroshock... this movie shows a clip of live animal mutilation of an animal getting hacked by a machete and getting its skin ripped off. i know these horrible things happen in the world, but im watching movies based on the fact that what im watching is not actually happening on the screen. these live animal clips are not meant to be in movies, they are meant to show people that belong to certain organizations to help the horrible things that humans to do other species. this should be banned and destroyed. i have also contacted netflix and other resources to collaborate getting this movie off the market!! this movie should be removed from the public. the person who made this movie needs psychological help. anyone who thinks kool moe dee, carol alt, and corey feldman comprise a list of good actors must be smoking something i\\'d love to try sometime. where to begin: lousy soundtrack, hammy acting, \"action\" in places. this is the typical amateurishly written hack fodder that washed-up has-been and never-was\\'s love to star in. i actually felt embarrassed for the \"stars\" in this \"film\". the only thespian missing to top this turd was gary coleman, who if he would have been in the movie, would have made it at least somewhat howlingly bad, rather than just plain bad. there was one part in the film where carol alt screamed, \"do you think i\\'m an idiot?!?\" yes, carol, i do, your agent does, and please for the love of all that is decent and holy... go away and stop degrading yourself like this! this film is something anna nicole smith would take part in. i would tell you what the plot was, but that would be one more sentence fragment to this article, plus my mind drifted many times during the movie anyway, so i barely paid attention. this film could have been a decent re-make, and gosh knows it tried (or ms. english tried). assembling talented actors together with a successful & experienced writer/director should be a formula for a decent film. but ms. english\\'s experience - according to her imdb bio - is exclusively limited to television work, and it is glaringly obvious throughout this film. i am surprised that none of the reviews i have read mention what i found most unlikeable about this film, and what kept it from reaching even a portion of its potential: it looked and felt like it was made for television. to give some credit to ms. english, many of the jokes that simply did not work on a movie screen would have been terrific on tv (and maybe a laugh track would have helped). so much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on tv but looked awkward or odd on a big screen. if the whole film had been chopped up into a mini-series or a sit-com, i think it could have worked. but this is cinema and sadly ms. english\\'s talents didn\\'t translate. i cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors & the writers that i felt like i came out of the theater half shriveled! meg ryan is her usual perky, cute self (except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face), but where did she have a chance to use her talent?! she has made films where she doesn\\'t recreate her stereo-typed role and done them well... but not here. annette bening seemed to simply go through the motions - such a great talent and yet such a poor performance! i enjoyed the other women characters but they were more caricature than substance, and it was sad to see. what worked in this film in the 1930s doesn\\'t translate to the 2000s, and no one helped ms. english get the changes & updates or subtleties right. if only she (as writer, director and producer) had reached out for some assistance, i think it could have been good. but it was not. it\\'s so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director and come away feeling it was a waste of everyone\\'s time & money! this new yorker cartoon i saw yesterday is appropriate: a few movie execs are having a meeting & the caption reads: \"let\\'s remake a classic with worse everything!\" i find it very intriguing that lee radziwill, jackie kennedy\\'s sister and the cousin of these women, would encourage the maysles\\' to make \"big edie\" and \"little edie\" the subject of a film. they certainly could be considered the \"skeletons\" in the family closet. the extra features on the dvd include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women. i\\'d say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating. (i.e. \"are they nuts? or am i missing something?\"). this movie is hard to come by. netflix does not have it. facets does, though. c\\'mon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode. it\\'s just an old 60\\'s tv show ! this episode of star trek is notable because of the most serious babe (yeoman barrow\\'s) ever used on star trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location. unlike the tng and voyager series which were totally confined to sound stages. this use of an outdoor location (and babe) gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar show. except a few notable exceptions i.e \"the city on the edge of forever\" , \"assignment earth\" and \"tomorrow is yesterday\" the old series of star trek needs to be seriously moth-balled and put out of it\\'s boring misery. half a dozen good episodes from 79 is quite a poor batting average. this is typical of the boring stuff gene roddenberry produced back then actually, contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on, he actually made a lot of rubbish! he doesn\\'t deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as irwin allen for example. just look at the set of the bridge of the enterprise from a modern point of view. they used wobbly plywood for the floor, cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels. you can clearly see the folds in the paper ! every expense spared or what ! i just watched this movie on it\\'s premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. i liked (not loved) \"mork & mindy\" as a kid, mostly for robin william\\'s zany energetic performance. this movie made me remember why. was the original show great? not really, but robin certainly was. which brings me to this movie. i was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). but, of course, the real focus was on robin. it was interesting to see robin\\'s journey from struggling street jester to national t.v star, and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife. and my hat is off to star chris diamantopoulos as he portrayed mr. williams with integrity, sensitivity, and heart; not just a cute impression, although it was even dead-on. (on an unrelated note, i noticed that robin\\'s struggles were in some ways similar to andy kaufman, who was under-appreciated by network t.v. and held back creatively, but that\\'s the \"taxi\" behind the scenes biopic.) all in all, this was a very enjoyable flick, in which i felt i got to know a little more of the man behind the orkan. the acting was solid by all- never melodramatic like i suspected- and the story moved along well. performances that were particularly good were by those who played garry marshall and john belushi (the scene in which belushi heckles robin was a hoot!). not a great masterpiece by any means (i would have liked to have seen a tad more about pam dawber), but definitely watchable, especially for those robin williams and \"mork & mindy\" fans out there. nanoo, nanoo! i caught this film on azn on cable. it sounded like it would be a good film, a japanese \"green card\". i can\\'t say i\\'ve ever disliked an asian film, quite the contrary. some of the most incredible horror films of all time are japanese and korean, and i am a huge fan of john woo\\'s hong kong films. i an not adverse to a light hearted films, like tampopo or chung king express (two of my favourites), so i thought i would like this. well, i would rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious, badly acted film ever again. i think the director steven okazaki must have spiked the water with quaalude, because no one in this film had a personality. and when any of the characters did try to act, as opposed to mumbling a line or two, their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake. i honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted before...the only person who sounded genuine was brenda aoki.. i find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy, because i didn\\'t laugh once. even more surprising is that cbs morning news called this \"a refreshing breath of comedy\". it was neither refreshing, nor a breath of comedy. and the ending was very predictable, the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things. avoid this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting. i actually think that \"spike of bensonhurst\" is a better acted film than this...and i walked out half way through that film! before i begin, let me get something off my chest: i\\'m a huge fan of john eyres\\' first film project: shadowchaser. the film, a b-grade cross of both the terminator & die hard, may not be the work of a cinematic genius, but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit (& spawned two sequels & a spin off). judge and jury begins with joseph meeker, a convicted killer who was sent to death row following his capture after the so-called \"bloody shootout\" (which seems like a poor name for a killing spree â– meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store), being led to the electric chair. there is an amusing scene where meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love (who was killed during the shootout), expressing his revenge for the person who killed her â– michael silvano, a washed-up football star who spends his days watching his son alex practicing football with his high school team (and ends up harassing his son\\'s coach). but once executed, meeker returns as a revenant (or as kelly perine calls \"a hamburger without the fries\"), whose sole aim is to get his revenge, which basically means making silvano\\'s life a misery. let me point out the fact that judge and jury is not a true horror film. it is a supernatural action film, with meeker chasing silvano, using his ability to change form (which amounts to david keith dressing up as everything from an elvis impersonator, a french chef (with an accent as bad as his moustache), a drag queen, a clown & a stand-up comedian), a shotgun which fires explosive rounds & an invulnerability to death (although that doesn\\'t stop martin kove from shooting keith with a desert eagle), to pay silvano back for killing meeker\\'s wife. director john eyres does not seem interested in characterisations, instead focusing solely on action scenes, which the film has plenty of. but that is the film\\'s main flaw, since there\\'s nothing to connect the action scenes together. the acting is surprisingly good, with keith delivering the best performance, supported ably by kove, as well as paul koslo, who plays the washed-up cop quite well. kelly perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse. ye lou\\'s film purple butterfly pits a secret organization (purple butterfly) against the japanese forces in war torn shanghai. ding hui (zhang ziyi) and her ex-lover hidehiko itami (toru nakamura) find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meeting. i agree with the reviewer from paris. the film substitutes a convoluted, semi-historical conflict for a plot, without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes. the sudden time shifting doesn\\'t help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless. normally i don\\'t mind dark movies, but the absence of light, the bone-jarringly shaky camera footage, and the generally bad film-making techniques really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in. i also agree with the viewer from georgia that this film \"has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography\", but i don\\'t think that helps the movie. the backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the 20th century, and i don\\'t believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were a michael bay film. the overly melodramatic moments don\\'t add to its watchability. the actors are all suitably melancholy. zhang ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films, brooding and looking generally annoyed. however, at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst love-making scene since michael biehn and linda hamilton in the terminator. all in all, a very disappointing film, especially seeing as how it comes from the director of suzhou he. 2/10 after hearing about george orwell\\'s prophetic masterpiece for all of my life, i\\'m now 37, but never having read the book, i am totally confused as to what i\\'ve just seen. i am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel, as i\\'m sure most are, but only through hearsay and quotes. without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery, and even with it i\\'m still no more educated about the story of 1984 than i was before i watched it. on the plus side... the cinematography is amazing, hurt & burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate. the prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film making. now for the down sides, and there are plenty... there is a war going on, (at least as far as the propaganda is concerned), but why & with who? nothing is explained. there are a couple of names bandied about (eurasia etc), but they mean nothing without explanation. who is winston? what does he do? where does he come from? where does he work? why is he changing news reports? why isn\\'t he on the front line? why doesn\\'t he eat the food in the canteen? what is that drink he\\'s drinking through the entire film? why is he so weak & ill? why isn\\'t he brainwashed like the rest of them? what\\'s the deal with his mother & sister? what happened to his father? a little back story would have been nice, no scrub that, essential for those like myself that haven\\'t read the book. without it, this is just a confusing and hard to follow art-house movie that constantly keeps you guessing at what is actually going on. the soundtrack was dis-jointed and badly edited and the constant chatter from the big brother screens swamps the dialogue in places making it even harder to work out whats going on. i accept that this may have been an artistic choice but it\\'s very annoying all the same. also, i know this has been mentioned before, but why all the nudity? it just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage. i personally can\\'t abide the way hollywood feels it has to explain story lines word for word these days. we are not all brainwashed simpletons, but this is a few steps too far the other way. i can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that you\\'ve read the book because if this film really is the \\'literal translation\\' that i\\'ve seen many people say, i would find it very hard to understand why 1984 is hailed as the classic it is. there\\'s no denying that it was light years ahead of it\\'s time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date, (maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be?), but many sci-fi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storyline. i guess i have to do what i should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if i\\'m to make any sense out of this. all in all, very disappointed in something i\\'ve waited for years to watch. this cute animated short features two comic icons - betty boop and henry. henry is the bald, slightly portly boy from the comics who never speaks. well here he does speak! he wants to get a puppy from betty boop\\'s pet store, and when he is left to mind the store - some hilarious hijinks ensue. betty sings a song about pets, henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey, but everything works out in the end. i just got back from this free screening, and this \"osama witch project\" is the hands-down worst film i\\'ve seen this year, worse than even \"catwoman\" - which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fiction. in \"september tapes,\" a \"film crew\" of \"documentary journalists\" heads to afghanistan - despite being thoroughly unprepared for the trip, the conditions and, oh yeah, the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wife\\'s death on sept. 11 - to track down osama bin laden. they \"made\" eight tapes on their journey, which now \"document\" their travels and, of course, their attempts to kill the terrorist leader. (the eight tapes, thankfully, all end at points significant in the narrative, which is convenient for a \"documentary.\") the psychotic, idiotic protagonist - who is given to long, significant speeches that he probably learned watching \"macgyver\" - cares nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent crew as he gets them further and further into danger through a series of completely dumb mishaps. i don\\'t know why he didn\\'t just wear a sign on his back that said \"shoot me.\" the crew\\'s translator, supposedly their sensible voice-of-reason, does little more than whine and gets baffled as the idiot hero leads them into doom. you wish they\\'d brought along someone on their trip to call them all morons. around \"tape 4,\" i began rooting for the terrorists to shoot the film crew. i remember seeing this film in the theater in 1984 when i was 6 years-old (you do the math). i absolutely loved it. i was tarzan for the 2 weeks after seeing it (climbing the furniture, jumping around making monkey sounds). it started a fascination with tarzan and monkeys, but oddly enough a longer lasting love for christopher lambert (keep in mind that i saw highlander very shortly after this). 1984 was the last time i saw that film, until about a month ago. it happened to be on cable as i was getting ready for bed at 3:30 am and even though it was late and i was tired and i had to be at work at 9:00 am, i stayed up to watch this movie that i loved as a kid. upon viewing it i realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that, that andie macdowell\\'s voice was dubbed by someone else. ian holme was of course solid as usual, and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up, but what was most surprising was how good lambert was as tarzan. he was great! the depth he managed to capture in so few lines, his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark, were just amazing. as i stated earlier i am lambert fan, but i\\'m used to highlander, the hunted and fortress. in this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again. so to make a short story way too long, i was a little disappointed that the film was not that good, but i was glad to see that lambert was good and i do not regret staying up until 6:00am to see it. a family is traveling through the mid west. there\\'s widower ben (charles bateman), his girlfriend nicky (ahna capri) and ben\\'s little daughter k.t. (geri reischl). then hit a town named hillsboro where everyone acts more than a little strangely. their car breaks down and they\\'re forced to stay. they soon find out a witches coven has a spell over the town and is up to incredible evil. the story is not that good. people just figure things out of nothing and they just happen to find out where the witches are at the end. also there are a lot of loopholes left dangling at the end. the acting is pretty poor too. bateman and capri are bland and everybody else is about the same. only old pros strother martin and l.q. jones give good performances. still this movie does work. it forgoes blood and gore (there\\'s some but this is pg) and manges to work with some very creepy visuals and atmosphere. the acting hampers a lot of it but it still works. martin especially chews the scenery in his role. i can\\'t explain exactly why i (sort of) like this movie but it did work on me. it\\'s a quiet kind of horror that isn\\'t made anymore. hardly a masterwork but this deserves to be rediscovered. a 7. francis ford coppola wrote and directed this stunningly personal story of a married woman\\'s flight from her husband--and the reality that perhaps the youthful glee and excitement of her younger years are behind her. we learn little about this woman\\'s marriage except that she has been feeling her independence slipping away as of late; she\\'s also recently learned she\\'s pregnant, which has further complicated her heart (she doesn\\'t want to be a complacent wifey, despite the maternal way she speaks to her husband over the phone). she meets two men on her journey: a former college football hero who--after an accident during a game--has been left with permanent brain damage, and a sexy, strutting motorcycle cop who has a great deal of trouble in his own life. the clear, clean landscapes (as photographed by the very talented wilmer butler) are astutely realized, as are the characters. shirley knight, james caan, and robert duvall each deliver strong, gripping performances, most especially since these are not very likable people in conventional terms. some scenes (such as knight\\'s first call home from a pay-phone, or her first night alone with caan where they play \\'simon says\\') are almost too intimate to watch. coppola toys with reality, turning the jagged memories of his characters into scrapbooks we\\'ve been made privy to. he allows scenes to play out, yet the editing is quite nimble and the film is never allowed to get too heavy (there are at least two or three very frisky moments). it\\'s a heady endeavor--so much so that the picture was still being shown at festivals nearly five years later. some may shun coppola\\'s unapologetic twisting of events in order to underline the finale with bitter irony, however the forcefulness and drive behind the picture nearly obliterate its shortcomings. *** from **** this movie was not very well directed. they almost totally disregarded the book.i guess they were trying 2 save time. the only upside 2 me was that the actor who played finny was cute. some of the dialog between the main characters appeared a little gay which was not the case in the book. major parts of the book were once again chopped out.you lost the over all effect it was not as haunting as the book and left me lacking severely. also the strong language although it was brief was very unnecessary. also i was surprised ( not pleasantly) by a new character that was no where in the book.one of my favorite characters (leper) was poorly interpreted and portrayed. he seemed more sinister in the movie than the real leper was in the book. over all disappointing. the buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make kevin bacon disappear. sadly, they stopped there. they should have continued to make the script disappear, then the silly set, and finally every visible element of this film. because, there\\'s nothing else there to show. gary thompson and andrew marlowe are listed as the writing credits for this film. i don\\'t really think they exist. i think they bought this script at \"scripts-r-us\", where you buy a standard blank \"monster movie\" script and just fill in the blanks. there\\'s a monster stalking us. let\\'s split up. (they actually \"let\\'s split up\" in this movie). hit alien/giant-bug/monster/invisible-man with crowbar. not dead yet. burn huge-rabbit/shark/invisible-man in unsurvivable fire. not dead yet. you know, the standard stuff. even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie (ir glasses, spraying with something like paint) were handled badly. what is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie. they psychological issues for the subject, the deterioration of the mind due to the process, treating an invisible subject, and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than 2 seconds and would have been far more interesting. had there been any desire to save kevin bacon in the end, it would have been a much better movie. all in all, it stunk. i would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie, but i don\\'t want to do any spoilers. suffice it to say that these characters are so stupid they don\\'t think about pulling the plug on a machine rather than... a young girl becomes a war-time marine\\'s pen-pal, and when he visits at war\\'s end expecting someone a bit more \"available,\" comic complications ensue. all ultimately works out well, naturally, but not before everyone involved has thoroughly chewed the scenery. errol flynn\\'s dead-on impression of humphrey bogart from \"casablanca\" is a highlight, as are various send-ups of his own swashbuckling image (the \"jumping\" scene in the kitchen with forrest tucker is a riot). it is tucker, though, who \"tucks\" the movie under his arm, lowers his head and barrels over the goal line. he demonstrates the comic flair more fully developed twenty years later in \"f-troop\" and imparts a liveliness and energy that flynn repeatedly plays off to raise his own performance. eleanor parker does a fine job as the woman being pursued, and little patti brady charms as tucker\\'s actual pen-pal friend. a fine, lightweight \"coming home\" comedy in a genteel setting that children and romantics of all ages should find entertaining. this movie is a perfect adaptation of the english flick unfaithful. ashmit plays the role of richard gere, emran that of olivier and malikka the perfect cheating wife role of lane.they have changed the second half of the film to adapt for the indian masses. even then the movie has got the full traces of unfaithful, though it couldn\\'t catch up with the original. it was a cheap soft porn of the bollywood lovers, where mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone dared to show. emran did more roles like this and was even nicknamed the serial killer. in the future if the indian directors plan to remake a english movie then they have to look into the feasibility of the plot with the indian censors. though the film bombed at the box office, the actors got the undue recognition. in future the directors should be a little more careful in remaking a oscar nominated film. all said, this is not a family film, so take the extra caution while watching it at home with family. robert altman\\'s downbeat, new-fangled western from edmund naughton\\'s book \"mccabe\" was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following. aside from a completely convincing boom-town scenario, the characters here don\\'t merit much interest, and the picture looks (intentionally) brackish and unappealing. bearded warren beatty plays a turn-of-the-century entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel; once the profits start coming in, beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action. altman creates a solemn, wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place, but the action in this sorry little town is limited--most of the story being made up of vignettes--and altman\\'s pacing is deliberately slow. there\\'s hardly a statement being made (just the opposite, in fact) and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds. it\\'s a self-defeating picture, and yet, in an altman-quirky way, it wears defeat proudly. ** from **** what seemed at first just another introverted french flick offering no more than baleful sentiment became for me, on second viewing, a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation. spoiler of sorts follows. poor cedric; he apparently didn\\'t know what hit him. poor audience; we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch. these two guys just didn\\'t belong together from their first ambiguous encounter. as much as mathieu and cedric were sexually attracted to each other, the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for mathieu, an intellectual being, to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beach. on a purely technical note, i loved the camera action in this film. subtitles were totally unnecessary, even though my french is \"presque rien.\" i could watch it again without the annoying english translation and enjoy it even more. this was a polished, very professionally made motion picture. though many scenes seem superfluous, i rate it nine out of ten. i don\\'t think i\\'ve ever gave something a 1/10 rating, but this one easily gets the denomination. i find it hard just to sit through one of his jokes. it\\'s not just that the jokes are so bad, but combine that with the fact that carson daily has zero charisma, can\\'t set up or finish a punchline, and you\\'ve got a late night comedy recipe that will really turn your stomach. i have watched the show, never in its entirety, but many times still. it just creeps up on me after conan. i usually watch a minute or two just to see if carson daily is still the worst talk show host ever. actually if you ever do see him interviewing a guest, it\\'s just that, an interview. i feel so sorry every time he has a guest on and their confused smiles try to mask their body language that\\'s screaming, \"get me the hell away from this freak!\" i do recommend watching the show, not for a laugh, but to ponder, how he got on the air and what he\\'s still doing there. watch as much as you can, i think you will find its complete awkwardness...interesting. in the standard view, this is a purely awful movie. however, it rates a near perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale. i can think of few actual comedies that make me laugh as hard as i did watching this movie. andy griffith\\'s ghost dressed in native american garb dancing sends me into hysterics everytime. i wouldn\\'t waste the gas or energy driving to the video store to rent it, but if you happen to be laying on the couch at 3 in the morning and it comes on tv, check it out. from the film\\'s first shot - keira knightley as elizabeth bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn, thus invoking all the clichã©s cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong-minded rebellious female character in period drama - i knew i was in for something to make me want to kill myself. joe wright seemed not only to have not read the book, but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact jane austen\\'s subtle, nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling, delicate social interaction in eighteenth century english drawing-rooms, but a sort of u-certificate wuthering heights. thus we were treated to every scene between elizabeth and darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason, in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain. not to mention that jane austen, and in particular p & p, is not about passion, sexual tension or love. it\\'s about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society. which was completely ignored, so that the bennets\\' house was a rambunctious, chaotic place where everybody shouts at once, runs around, leaves their underwear on chairs, and pigs wander happily through the house; the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a matrix reloaded style dance-orgy; and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety. the genius of jane austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety, and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap. so both the brilliance of jane austen and the very factor that allows her plots - particularly in this film - to function was completely erased. subtlety in general was nowhere int his film, sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances. it was so obviously trying to be a *serious* film. the humour - which is pride & prejudice, both austen\\'s methodology and her appeal - was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po-faced melodrama, and when it was allowed in, was handled so clumsily. pride & prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points, yes, but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour, they are embedded in it. you can\\'t lose jane austen\\'s technique, leaving only the bare bones of the story, and expect the themes to remain. not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy-handed mystical-numinous fauxbrow cinematography. elizabeth bennett is supposed to be a woman, an adult, mature and sensible and clear-sighted. keira knightley played the first half of the film like an empty-headed giggling schoolgirl, and the second half like an empty-headed schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine. elizabeth\\'s wit, her combative verbal exchanges, her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybody\\'s follies including her own, her strength and composure, and her fantastic clear-sightedness were completely lost and replaced with ... what? a lot of giggling and staring into the distance? rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs, she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation - and not genuinely raging, either; no, these were petulant hissy fits. and where the great strength of austen\\'s elizabeth (at least in austen\\'s eyes) was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety, knightley\\'s elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention. furthermore, she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong-minded, and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it. an astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance. in which quest for blandness and weakness, she was ably matched by matthew macfayden. donald sutherland as mr bennet seemed weak, ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes mr bennet so fascinating and tragic. his special bond with lizzie, as the only two sensible people in a world of fools, was completely lost, not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools, and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact. mr bingley was no longer amiable and well-meaning to the point of folly, but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs, and the woman who was playing jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all. the script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of jane austen - delivered with remarkable clumsiness - and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy. just get the bbc adaptation on dvd and save yourself the heartache. i\\'ve always enjoyed films that depict life as it is. life sometimes has boring patches, no real plot, and not necessarily a happy ending. \"a river runs through it\" is the perfect name for this film (and norman maclean\\'s novel). life ebbs and flows like a river, and it has it\\'s rough spots, but it is a wonderful trip. robert redford brings a lot to the film. his narration has a friendly feel that fits the picture perfectly. as a director, he is restrained and calm, and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes. as for the acting, craig sheffer and brad pitt work surprising well as brothers. i don\\'t know quite how to describe tom skerritt and brenda blethyn\\'s performances, except that they truly feel real. \"a river runs through it\" is a wonderful film. 8.6 out of 10 the story is very trustworthy and powerful. the technical side of the movie is quite fine.. even the directing of it. the main problem is with the castings, that turned that movie into almost another local and regular clichã© with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression. beside the small role of the father, rafael (played impressively by asi dayan), all other actors were unfortunately not in their best. the role of the elder blind girl, played by taly sharon, was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role. therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile. there were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie. but after all it\\'s a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future. this movie was not so much promoted here in greece,even though it got good actors , great script and rather good photograph was not a so called \"blockbuster\" movie in my country. the movie itself is very powerful,it\\'s about the hard time that a newcomer had to go through when he returns in his home-village after been released from a 5yo prison time(drugs) the end is rather sad.... mourikis is trying to keep up with his part and he handles it pretty well... lambropoulou is great and very sexy in a strange way and of course hatzisavvas is for one more time close to excellency... 7 out of 10 because very few greek movies can make such an impression! mystery men has got to be the stupidest film i\\'ve ever seen, but what a film! i thought it was fabulous, excellent and impressive. it was funny, well-done and nice to see ridiculous super heroes for a change! and being able to pull it off! this was great! i\\'ll definitely watch it again! you know that mouthwash commercial where the guy has a mouth full of listerine or whatever it is and he\\'s trying really hard to keep from spitting it up into the sink? that\\'s a great metaphor for this movie. i kept watching, even though it was really difficult. but keeping mouthwash in your mouth will leave you with a minty fresh feeling. this movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth. i should have spit it out when i had the chance. the premise is corny enough to be fun. for the first time in like a thousand years, gargoyles have returned to romania, and all of the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things are long dead. it\\'s up to michael pare and some other secret agents to get to the bottom of things before the gargoyles run amok. unfortunately, the premise is completely lost in bad dialog and less than enthusiastic acting on the part of the human leads. the best acting is done by the cg gargoyles. in the end, this movie feels like a poor man\\'s van helsing. if you check your brain at the door, this might get you through a dreary monday night. i gave it 3 out of 10 stars. i can\\'t believe it that was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life. i laughed a couple of times. ( probably because of how stupid it was ) if someone paid me to see that movie again i wouldn\\'t. the plot was so horrible , it made no sense , and the acting was so bad that i couldn\\'t even tell if they were trying. that movie was terrible rating: f this is one of a rarity of movies, where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch it with a bottle of vodka. to be completely honest we are a group of people who actually know the man, mo ogrodnik, and decided to drink ourselves stupid to this film. the cinematic aspect of wolfgang something\\'s photography seems to have left out both close-ups and breasts. mo and wolfgang\\'s collaborative effort revealed the passion of the two actresses, plastic peens holding passion. there\\'s also beetle banging. as violet would have put it: \"this (plastic peen) goes up your butt\". the rat porn and subsequent rat smashing is awesome. alright. so if you are still reading, let us explain who we are. mo ogrodnik teaches at nyu and we are a group of her students, who, finishing a film class with her, decided to get poop- faced and watch here directorial debut. she also wrote uptown girls. i can\\'t tell you how much that\\'s been hammered into our skulls. so this movie is quite the experience. at the very bottom of this post will be a drinking game we created for this movie. about 13 minutes into this game, none of us could see straight. the sheer amount of dido\\'s in the first thirty minutes created enough reasons to drink to pacify an elephant.there was something secretly pleasurable about seeing two underage girls hit on a kurt cobain lookalike with absolutely no context, save for his mysterious scene at the convenience store where he was oh-so-naturally reading a local newspaper. because that\\'s what we all do. the heart-shaped glasses were delightfully derivative of lolita. and something about that provocative scene of the nude chin-up boy suggests the director\\'s history of homosexual pornographic experiments. we wish we were kidding. enough intellectual contemplation. on to the drinking game! this will ensure that the viewing experience is a positive one. it\\'s very simple, and very likely to send at least one member of your party to immediate care. the mo ogrodnik/ripe drinking game: 1. every time you see anything related to pornography, take a drink. 2. every time you see auteur mo ogrodnik\\'s name appear, take a drink. 3. sex. 4. (plastic peen) require two drinks. 5. any time somebody points a gun at another character, take a drink. -at this point you will probably need to refill/pee pee any remaining sobriety from your body.- 6. any time there is blood (including \"lady blood\"), please take a sip! 7. the underused hula-hoop girl requires one drink per second. 8. gratuitous use of the \"magic black man\" requires one drink. 9. if you can\\'t figure out the through-line, keep drinking, beyotch. 10. whenever you are able to predict a line, take a drink. trust us. it\\'s easy. that\\'s it, internet! keep drinking, and try not to get riped. -hawaiian smirnoff punch, jr. even though i\\'m quite young, the beatles are my absolutely favourite band! i never had the chance to hear their music as it was releases but have loved them since i can remember. it\\'s the sort of film that is worth trying the once. i can see why it wasn\\'t released in the cinema but it is certainly a great film to put on the tv. i was flicking through my tv guide and happened to see this film, it didn\\'t much details except something like, \\'john lennon and paul mccartney meet after the beatles have broken up, jared harris stars\\'. i\\'d never heard of him (he played john) or aiden quinn who played paul. however they are certainly underestimated actors! the film had a slow start but as it developed, i could see how well quinn but especially harris played their characters. as a huge fan, i sort of know what the real lennon and mccartney are like. the script was brilliant and harris got lennon\\'s accent, personality and mannerisms spot on! quinn played mccartney quite well but sometimes went into his irish accent. the make-up artists made them look excellent. this paragraph may be counted as a *spoiler*: as i mentioned before, it got off to a slow start but soon developed and became quite an emotional film. i found the bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musicians. as for lennon\\'s rude line in the italian restaurant, totally unnecessary. the ending was very poignant and brings a tear to my eye whenever i watch it. it is quite different from the other biographical films i\\'ve seen where it\\'s about how the beatles got together and became famous, and those never really did the characters that well. e.g. \\'backbeat\\'. in conclusion, i would say, if you\\'re a beatles or john lennon or paul mccartney fan, give it a chance you may have pleasent surprise. at only about 95 minutes long, it\\'s worth waiting for the film to develop. if anyone does know whether the meeting of 1976 really did happen please send it to the \\'comments page\\' for this film, i\\'d be very interested. an american werewolf in london had some funny parts, but this one isn\\'t so good. the computer werewolves are just awful: the perspective is all off, it\\'s like seeing them through a distorting mirror. the writers step on the throat of many of their gags. american boy says to parisian girl, \"is there a cafe\\' around here?\" instead of just leaving it at that, they have to have the girl sigh and respond, \"this is paris.\" originally i was a tenacious d fan of their first album and naturally listened to a few tracks off the p.o.d. and was rather disappointed. after watching the movie, my view was changed. the movie is pretty funny from beginning to the end and found my self engaged in it even though it was really was a stupid storyline because of the attitudes that kg and jaybles portray in the movie. much more entertaining and enjoyable than movies i have seen in the theaters lately. ex. saw iii (dull and dragging), casino royale (way to homo-erotic) which in prior installments i have really enjoyed if you enjoyed borat, you will enjoy the tale of the greatest band on earth this is just one more of those hideous films that you find on lifetime tv which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic manner. along with other such nasty films as \"the burning bed,\" \"enough,\" or \"monster,\" this film takes a disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why she\\'s not such a bad person after all. give us a break! here\\'s my question to the filmmakers: if letourneau were a man, and vili were a 12 year old girl, would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person? answer: hell no. imagine switching the genders in this film, and then you\\'ll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage. were the genders switched, there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal. instead, we\\'d likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man preying upon a young girl, his lascivious behavior landing him in prison, and his brainwashed victim suffering from stockholm syndrome. the only reason letourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sex. let\\'s call a spade a spade. letourneau is a pedophile. plain and simple. no ifs, ands or buts. she\\'s a criminal who belongs in prison, and deserves our derision and contempt, but certainly not our pity or empathy. the premise of this movie was decent enough, but with sub par acting, it was just bland and dull. spoilers the film does not work because of the nature of the death, it was accidental, so although it was a murder it wasn\\'t like the guy set out to do it. also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree. there is no emotion in this film. the first 20 minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister, and hearing her message. it was dull and boring. with some polishing, and better acting it could have been pretty good. the lives of the saints starts off with an atmospheric vision of london as a bustling city of busy, quaint streets and sunshine. i was hoping it would maintain this atmosphere, but it gets bogged down in a story that goes pretty much nowhere. othello works for big, fat mr. karva, his crime-boss step-dad (at least i think that is what he is supposed to be because it\\'s never really defined, but he does drop kittens into deep fat friers, so trust me, he\\'s a prick) doing scrappy little errands while his skanky girlfriend gives daddy hand-jobs. one of his colleagues is runner, a black dude who is always dashing from a to b. until the day he comes across almost mute homeless child who grants him his wish of being able to stop running. runner dumps the lost boy in othello\\'s flat, where he promptly starts granting more wishes. keen to have some of his own desires fulfilled, karva has the boy kidnapped. but he isn\\'t sure of what would really bring him happiness. is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another hand-job? either way, i don\\'t want to see the little boy grant him the second. it just takes ages to get going and there are loads of repetitive scenes. the ending tries to be shocking but since there\\'s hardly any back-story on investment in any of these characters it only serves as a release for the bored audience. writer tony grisoni, a favourite of terry gilliam, tries to blend in some kind of religious allegory which ends up being pretentious as all hell, ironically. if he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters suddenly acting all weird then it would have been a more enjoyable film. as it is, we are introduced to a bunch of annoying loudmouths who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy. who\\'s origins are never revealed. that\\'s just plain irritating! aside from sporadic moments of atmosphere and a moody score, this film has little to recommend. i can\\'t emphasize it enough, do *not* get this movie for the kids. for that matter, you\\'d best spare the adults from it as well. all right, perhaps i\\'m overexaggerating a little. this isn\\'t the worst kids\\' movie... no, let me rephrase that. this isn\\'t the worst movie made by dissilusioned adults for dissilusioned adults and somehow marketed towards kids (that would be \"jack\", which i\\'ve been meaning to review / gut like a fish). adults won\\'t learn anything surprising (well, if you must, fast-forward to just before the end credits for a educational bit about an interesting cosmic phenominon). we don\\'t usually end up doing as adults what we wanted to do as kids as reality tends to get in the way. well, duh, i could have told you that (so can four years of college at an art school, but i degress). i have no idea what the heck kids could possibly get out of this movie. most likely it will only upset them (we get to watch the moment when russ was traumatized at eight years old). there\\'s a better movie, \"kiki\\'s delivery service\", that has essentially the same message but handles it litely instead of drilling it into your head. and the adults will like it too! by the way, there is a moment in the movie made with amature mst3k-ers in mind, if they think of that other bruce willis movie with a sad little kid in it. is nothing else on tv? are you really bored? well, then watch phat beach. however, don\\'t rent it and definitely do not buy it. that would be a big mistake. i watched this on tv and found myself laughing at certain points. i did not laugh long and i did not laugh hard. however, there were subtle jokes and comments i laughed at. if you are looking for an extremely funny \"hood\" movie then watch friday. if you are looking for a powerful emotional movie (something that this movie tries at..kind of) watch something like hoop dreams or jason\\'s lyric. if you are lookin for some good black \"booty\" go watch a dominique simone porn flick, because the nudity in this movie is nearly non-existent. however, if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable, go ahead and watch it. you will be slightly amused. ***3 out of 10*** the elegant documentary - don\\'t watch this movie ... if you\\'re an egotistical know-all student of physics. this much less than one percent (miniscule fraction) of the population may find that this show just tells them what they have already learned and already know. do watch this movie! - if you\\'re one of the massive majority of people that fall into the greater than 99% of the population that does not study or already have a sound knowledge of the theories of physics including relativity, quantum, string and m-theory. what a brilliantly architected documentary. starting with some helpful historical background you will be lead step by elegant step into a universe of pure magic - and dimensions beyond. i have always had a huge appreciation of mathematics. this movie can easily give you an insight into what an exquisitely beautiful language mathematics is without making you feel like you\\'re about to fail the grade. the show is repetitive at times as the original format was a mini-series split over three shows. it therefore makes sense to give us polite little reminders of the principles being presented. i found this immensely helpful as it kept reminding me of the multitude of questions and possible answers that make up this amazing tapestry of our very existence. we are all (and everything around us) is vibrational-energy with a natural tendency towards harmony. this movie may blow your mind - or at least help you realize that the universe is far far bigger than that which we see around us (even with the hubble telescope) and far far smaller than the protons and neutrons within the atoms we learned about in high-school. m-theory holds many magnificent magnitudes of \\'possibility\\'. it just seemed so appropriate that all of this elegance should by it\\'s very nature move (by admission by the many brilliant scientists presenting) out of the realm of science and into the realm of philisophy. you do not have to be religious at all to feel like this movie brought you one step closer to god. bravo brian greene. well done indeed. p.s. if you\\'re interested in feeling even more comfortable and at home in your place in the universe and would like some more insight into the \\'possibilities\\' quantum mechanics blended with spirituality (of all things) can bring then i highly recommend that you also watch \"what the bleep!? - down the rabbit hole\". yes i know they make a few silly mistakes by suggesting a shaman may not be able to see a boat if he hasn\\'t seen one before (my eyes process light reflections just fine - i see things everyday that i\\'ve never seen before) and brain cells are cells in the body that actually don\\'t divide. but if you can get over these little hurdles and put down the things you don\\'t like and hang on to those that you do - there is a lot to like about this film. then watch \"the secret\" (2006 documentary about the law of attraction - search for imdb title \"tt0846789\"). this information just might change your life profoundly - forever. if you search deeper you might even find the universe is talking to us with thought (if you\\'ll listen) - and some are - and that is truly incredible. there is a modern day jesus/mohammad/buddha (those, among others, that history suggests have communicated with the non-physical) alive today and she lives in texas. i know some of you know what i\\'m talking about. i do not consider myself religious by any traditional definition but i have never felt more at home or as comfortable in the universe as i do now. in 1993, with the success of the first season of batman: the animated series, warner brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit-show with producing a feature-length movie, originally slated for direct-to-video, but bumped up to theatrical status. it would become known as batman: mask of the phantasm. ten years after phantasm, we have had an additional three feature-films released from the boys at the wb, sub-zero, return of the joker, and now, mystery of the batwoman joins the family. the plot is basic and in many ways similar to mask of the phantasm: a new female vigilante modeling herself after batman has begun targeting operations run by gotham mob boss rupert thorne and oswald cobblepot aka the penguin. now, batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the batwoman before she crosses the line. the animation is the sleeker, futuristic style that was utilized for batman: the animated series\\' fifth and sixth seasons (aka the new batman adventures). , it\\'s quite nicely done, and just as sleek as return of the joker\\'s animation. there is also some use of cgi, but it\\'s minor compared to the overabundance of it in sub-zero. the music was alright. different and exotic and similar to the justice league score, although the points in the score when the old animated batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans\\' rodent-shaped hearts. kevin conroy, as always, does a wonderful job as bruce wayne and batman. it\\'s also great to have the old batman: the animated series alumni back; that includes bob hastings (commissioner gordon), robert costanzo (detective bullock), tara strong (barbara gordon/batgirl; her cameo hints at the romantic-relationship between her and bruce that was mentioned in batman beyond), and efrem zimbalist jr.(alfred). villains were also great - especially given that rupert thorne, the old mob boss from the original series, appears for the first time since the fourth season. overall, while not quite reaching the standard set by mask of the phantasm ten years ago, motb carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated batman films. and if you have the dvd and are a hardcore fan, you will love the five-minute short chase me. i think this movie was supposed to be shocking. but the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it\\'s been made ...and simply is. it\\'s one-and-a-half hour of torment. even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie (the five girls). sure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way, which is basically fine, since it\\'s a horror-movie. and i (usually) like horror-movies. i\\'ve no problem with violence in these type of movies per se. however all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever. it\\'s no spectacle other than that it\\'s simply grotesque. it\\'s so lame it even gets boring, and really quick too. the worst thing (if the above wasn\\'t bad enough for ya) about this movie is that they\\'ve tried to copy the blair whitch project, by filming with cheap hand-held-cameras. but (again, this too) serves no end whatsoever. in the \"blair which\", sure enough, there\\'s an explanation, namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch. in this film, there\\'s no other explanation than: \"hey ya\\'ll we wanted this to look like the blair whitch!!\" the sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about. the girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you can\\'t make out what they\\'re saying. also, no effort has been made to make anything any better, sound-wise or other wise. than finally, there\\'s the soundtrack, which is just as bad as the rest, and varies from cheap euro-house to the worst grungy hard-rock... my advise: don\\'t watch this under any circumstances. why can\\'t a movie be rated a zero? or even a negative number? some movies such as \"plan nine from outer space\" are so bad they\\'re fun to watch. this is not one. \"the dungeon of horror\" might be the worst movie i\\'ve ever seen (some of anyway. i had to fast forward through a lot of it!). fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advancing age, there may be worse movies i\\'ve seen, but thankfully, i can\\'t remember them. the sets appeared to be made with cardboard and finished with cans of spray paint. the special effects looked like a fifth grader\\'s c+ diorama set in a shoebox. the movie contained unforgivable gaffs such as when the marquis shoots and kills his servant. he then immediately gets into a scuffle with his escaping victim, who takes his flintlock and shoots him with it, without the gun having been reloaded! this movie was so bad my dvd copy only had name credits. i guess no company or studio wanted to be incriminated. though i guess when you film in your garage and make sets out of cardboard boxes a studio isn\\'t needed. this movie definitely ranks in my cellar of all time worst movies with such horrible sacrileges as \"the manipulator\", the worst movie i have ever seen with an actual (one time) hollywood leading man-mickey rooney. the only time i would recommend watching \"the dungeon of harrow\" (or \"the manipulator\" for that matter) would be if someone were to pay you. (i\\'m kind of cheap) i\\'d have to have $7 or $8 bucks for \"dungeon\" and at least ten for \"manipulator\". phil-the never out of the can cinematographer this movie took me by surprise. the opening credit sequence features nicely done animation. after that, we\\'re plunged into a semi-cheesy production, betraying its low budget. the characters, typical american teens, are introduced slowly, with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this. by the time the shlitz hits the fan, we know each one of the characters, and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities. it\\'s a slow uphill set-up, kind of like the ride up a slope of a really tall roller coaster. thankfully, once the action kicks in, it\\'s full blown old school horror! steve johnson\\'s make-up effects are awesome. equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films. and the scares are jolting. kevin tenney delivers his best movie ever, with heart-stopping surprises and creepy suspenseful set-ups. the tongue-in-cheek, sometimes cheesy, humor marks this film as pure 80s horror, as opposed to the sullen tone of earlier genre fare like \"night of the living dead\" or \"hills have eyes.\" but for true horror fans, this one is worth checking out. play it as the first entry on a double bill with the 1999 remake of \"house on the haunted hill.\" the set-up and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder what film they were actually remaking? though i\\'d heard that \"cama de gato\" was the worst brazilian movie of the decade, i watched it giving it a chance; after all, first-time director/producer/writer alexandre stockler managed to make his debut feature (shot in video) for just us$ 4,000 and -- though it looks even cheaper -- i can\\'t begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theaters with no big sponsors or production companies behind it (then as i watched it i realized why). but whatever chances you\\'re ready to give to \"cama de gato\", they shrink to zero within 10 minutes: it\\'s an unbelievably preposterous, verbose, ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray brazilian upper-middle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neo-nazis hooked on bad sex, drugs and violence (and they\\'re made to look like closeted gays too), made with no visible trace of talent, imagination, expertise or notion of structure. visually and aurally, it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on youtube -- only here it lasts ninety two (count\\'em) minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness, and it\\'s not even funny-bad. we\\'ve all seen the story before: bored young guys want to have fun, go partying, take drugs and everything goes wrong -- there\\'s gang-rape, spanking, murder, the accidental death (falling down the staircase!!) of the mother of one of the boys, culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill. moral and literal garbage, get it? the film is heavily influenced by larry clark (especially \"kids\" and \"bully\"), but clark\\'s films -- though also moralist and sexploitative -- are high-class masterworks compared to this crap. i don\\'t think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audience\\'s throat: stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his non-stop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion -- you do get numb-minded with so much babbling, yelling, inept direction, shaky camera and terrible acting going on. stockler doesn\\'t care a bit about technique (the quality of the images, framing, sound recording, soundtrack songs, dialog, sets, editing, etc is uniformly appalling), but he\\'s a narcissistic control-freak: he anticipates the criticisms he\\'s bound to get by adding subtitles with smartie/cutie comments, and by making the protagonists comment at one point how far-fetched and phony it all is (i could relate to that). despite his megalomaniac ambitions, stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure -- he can\\'t even decide if he wants gritty realism (hand-held video camera etc) or stylization (repetition of scenes, use of alternate takes, etc). damn, he can\\'t even decide where to put his camera (there\\'s use of subjective camera for the three leads)! the dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever; the plot exists simply to justify the director\\'s profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for. all you see is a filmmaker being hateful, preachy, condemning, moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent (or technique) to go with it. it\\'s very disappointing to find caio blat in this mess. certainly one of the most promising young film actors in brazil, with his sleepy-eyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall sal mineo\\'s, blat can be highly effective under good direction (as in \"carandiru\", \"lavoura arcaica\", \"proibido proibir\"). here, he\\'s told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly under-equipped \"actors\" in recent memory. he also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes (so goddawful they look rather like web-cam porn). the film opens and ends with real interviews with \"typical\" (?) middle-class youth -- stockler wants us to take those interviews as \"proof\" of what he\\'s trying to preach in fiction. but he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees, selecting a highlight of abject, racist, sexist, stupid statements (which only shows assholes exist everywhere). stockler wants to prove that brazilian middle-class youths are all present or future fascists because they\\'re middle-class and enjoy recreational drugs (is he saying all neo-fascists are on drugs?? or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior?? i couldn\\'t tell). with its dogmatic self-righteousness, headache-inducing technique and mind-bending boredom, \"cama de gato\" is bad for a 1,000 reasons but, above all, it\\'s harmful in a very insidious manner: it gives detractors of brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument. \"cama de gato\" is best unwatched, unmentioned, buried and forgotten. an unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of the secret of nimh and the land before time, this was a very touching bittersweet cartoon. i remember this very well from my childhood, it was funny and sad and very beautiful. well it starts out a bit dark, a dog who escaped the pound, and gets killed by an old friend, ends up in heaven, and comes back. but it becomes sweet when he befriends an orphaned girl who can talk to animals. some scenes were a bit scary contrary to other cartoons, like the dream sequence of charlie, but everything else was okay,and the songs were fair. a memorable role of burt reynolds and dom deluise, i just love that guy, ahehehe. and judith barsi of jaws the revenge, may god rest her soul, poor girl, she didn\\'t deserve to die, but she is in heaven now, all good people go to heaven. overall this is a very good animated movie, a don bluth classic enough to put anime and disney to shame. recommended for the whole family. and know this, if you have the original video of this, you\\'ll find after the movie, dom deluise has a very important and special message, gotta love that guy, ahehehe. this movie was a failure as a comedy and a film in general. it was a very slow paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message, but the message was a clichã©, hopeless mess to begin with. this movie falls on shameless environmental point, even making a self-righteous point of destroying an suv and promoting animal planet. in sitting through this, i couldn\\'t help but notice that steve carell got no more than a single truly funny line. the only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief lines to wanda sykes. her character gets frequent, cringe-worthy lines where they absolutely do not fit. far from the brilliance of bruce almighty, evan almighty blows its whole record-breaking budget on special effect plot devices that turn out to barely advance the plot. the movie spends the first half building up to the construction of evan\\'s ark, but by the end, we learn that the ark was completely meaningless, and the whole plot was a just a vessel for the stupid gags and even stupider messages. the movie concludes when we learn that the whole ark, flood, and animal gathering was just a weak political statement by none other than god. yes, god was trying to influence politics. it is so gratifying to see one great piece of art converted into another without distortion or contrivance. i had no guess as to how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreated as a film worth seeing. if you loved bulgakov\\'s book you would be, understandably, afraid of seeing some misguided interpretation done more for the sake of an art-film project than for actually bringing the story\\'s deeper meaning to the screen. there are a couple examples of this with the master and margarita. as complex and far-fetched as the story is, the movie leaves out nothing. it is as if the filmmaker read bulgakov\\'s work the same way an orchestral conductor reads a score--with not a note missed. why can\\'t we find such talent here in the u.s. ? so now my favorite book and movie have the same title. this movie is very violent, yet exciting with original dialog and cool characters. it has one of the most moving stories and is very true to life. the movie start off with action star leo fong as a down and out cop who is approaching the end of his career, when he stumbles on to a big case that involves corruption, black mail and murder. this is where the killings start. from start finish fong delivers in this must see action caper. this movie also co-stars richard roundtree. i really enjoyed this film as a child but as i got older i realized that this film is pretty cheesy and not very good. i would not recommend this film and the action is very, very bad. the day has finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of azumi\\'s fate as an assassin, fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she rampaged through so mercilessly during the first saga. that\\'s as poetical as i\\'ll get when talking about azumi 2: death or love, because when i cringed over the heavy sentimentality of house of flying daggers and complained about the credibility of aya ueto portraying a blood-driven assassin, after watching azumi 2 i started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever before. not only does the determination of each assassin feels sluggish and uninspiring but also many important elements are omitted from the entire experience. in azumi 1 we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics (which is their number one priority) as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape. but i won\\'t hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in azumi\\'s way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma. by the way, chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of go go, minus the cool weapon and sense of menace. this brings me to the final blow which is the action, simply disguised in the title as the \\'death\\' side of the epic. in the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons. to no one\\'s surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily. in azumi 1, the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between azumi and bijomaru in comparison to the fights in azumi 2 was at least climaxed and worthwhile. some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter. i am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched. the romance side of azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution. as a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation, i won\\'t lie and i\\'ll admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first azumi film, but i\\'ll step right up and say that after watching azumi 2, the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece. for what it\\'s worth, azumi 2: death or love could have gone straight to video, with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins, doing their best to restore the peace, with an unwavering courage to die trying. this has to be the worst piece of garbage i\\'ve seen in a while. heath ledger is a heartthrob? he looked deformed. i wish i\\'d known that he and naomi watts are an item in real life because i spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him. orlando bloom is a heartthrob? with the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him, i can\\'t say i agree. rachel griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but geoffrey rush looked as if he couldn\\'t wait to get off the set. i\\'m supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers? this is a far cry from butch cassidy, which actually was an entertaining film. this was trite, cliche-ridden and boring. we only stayed because we were convinced it would get better. it didn\\'t. the last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious. heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel, and women and children are dying because of their presence. that\\'s not funny. but it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on, because all we could think of was the black knight from monty python and the holy grail. i kept waiting for them to say \"i\\'ll bite yer leg off!\" we were howling with laughter, as were several other warped members of the audience. when we left, pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was. i may not have paid cash to see this disaster (sneak preview), but it certainly wasn\\'t free. it cost me 2 hours of my life that i will never get back. a very ordinary made-for-tv product, \"tyson\" attempts to be a serious biopic while stretching the moments of angst for effect, fast forwarding through the esoterics of the corrupt sport of boxing, and muddling the sensationalistic stuff which is the only thing which makes tyson even remotely interesting. a lukewarm watch at best which more likely to appeal to the general public than to boxing fans. i\\'m sure deep in the recesses of jack blacks mind the character of nacho libre is absolutely hilarious but no it isn\\'t. you can tell ol jacks having a whale of a time hammin it up playing a smarmy, slimy mexican friar with dreams of becoming a wrestler but this movie is a total misfire in just about every single department. i just sat there through most of the movie thinking \"is this supposed to be funny\" and \"this is the guy from tenacious d right?\". the truth is this film has nothing to offer. at all! it\\'s a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff acting and direction. you\\'ll watch endless moments where you think something funny is surely about to happen but it just doesn\\'t. i was bored stupid about 10 minutes in but though it would surely pick up. it didn\\'t. 90 minutes later i\\'d barely managed to stave off an aneurism it was that painful. it\\'s like, remember years ago when you\\'d see anything with your fave actor in it, even some of their really early pap from before they were famous, and you\\'d be really embarrassed that said actor was actually in such a load of plop. yeah it\\'s like that. i\\'ve enjoyed some of jack black\\'s earlier movies like shallow hall and i\\'m really looking forward to seeing pick of destiny but come on man. if you do this to us again jack i\\'m gonna have to come round there and hammer your kneecaps or something. at the least give you a serious talking to. i know it\\'s a clichã© but this is one of the worst movies i\\'ve ever seen and for so many reasons.... i haven\\'t read the anne rice novel that this movie was based on, but who knows, maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting queen of the damned and is probably better for your health. it isn\\'t that this movie is necessarily bad for your health, but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie. you can count the number of pages by anne rice that i\\'ve read on one hand, but after seeing this movie and interview with a vampire, i get the feeling that she writes really good novels. the plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history. still, stuart townsend\\'s voice-over narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than brad pitt\\'s vampire narrative ever did, and you can tell that queen of the damned\\'s limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the anne rice storyline. while interview decided to go with lace and elegance, queen relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously. one can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places. the costumes and rock & roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack. however, i\\'ll give credit where credit is due. the soundtrack is excellent. korn and disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like butthead. the film opens with a very cool goth-rock zoom & splice montage, but after the first ten minutes or so, the directing degenerates quickly. it\\'s as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn\\'t enough time and enough money to do an anne rice novel justice. what results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects. unfortunately, queen of the damned fails to do the genre justice just as its john carpenter counterparts fail to impress. where are the yellow contacts? where\\'s the pale blue make-up? scene after scene, i shook my head reminiscing about the days of salem\\'s lot and fright night when low budget was done right. there are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage. props to aaliyah, and may her soul forever rest in peace. she might have become a renowned actress, had her life not been taken from us so prematurely, for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing. did i mention that the soundtrack was good? let\\'s see, what else can i say? it wasn\\'t too long. the anne rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like francis ford coppola got his hands on it. there are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot. but all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of second-rate vampire movies out there. the director of this movie went on to direct a new battlestar galactica mini series if that tells you anything. jy jimboduck-dot-com while i count myself as a fan of the babylon 5 television series, the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start. although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there, the pace of the gathering is slow, the makeup somewhat inadequate, and the plot confusing. worse, the characterization in the premiere episode is poor. although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems, i remember the gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series. leonard maltin gave this film a dreaded bomb rating in his 1995 movie and video guide. what film was he looking at? kid vengeance or god\\'s gun are bombs. this film is a delight. it is fantastic. it is literate. it is well mounted. it is beautiful photographed, making a brilliant use of colors. right from the opening scene the film grabs your attention and tips you off that this film is a well-done satire of the whole spaghetti western genre. the film is played for laughs from the beginning to the end with homages to douglas fairbanks, 77 sunset strip, and the famous showdown in the good, the bad, and the ugly. edd byrnes, george hilton, and gilbert roland work brilliantly together to make the satire work. it is too bad mr. maltin rated this film so poorly as it is undeserved. one can only guess as to his reason. i suspect that he missed the point of the movie entirely and was expecting something more serious than this film is meant to be. kudos belong to everyone involved in this project. this film is a little gem waiting to be discovered by people who care about literate movies and appreciate satire. i don\\'t believe there has ever been a more evil or wicked television program to air in the united states as the 700 club. they are today\\'s equivalent to the ku klux klan of the 20th century. their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand. their daily constant attacks upon millions and millions of americans, as well as billions of humans the world over, who don\\'t happen to share their bigoted, cruel, monstrous, and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television has ever seen. the lies they spout and the ridiculous lies they try to pass off as truth, such as the idea of \"life after death\" or \"god\" or \"sin\" or \"the devil\" is so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill, so lost are they in their fantasy. sane people know that religion is a drug and shouldn\\'t let themselves get addicted to that type of fantasy. however, the 700 club is in a class by itself. they are truly a cult. while i believe in freedom of speech, they way they spread hatred, lies, disinformation, and such fantastic ideas is beyond all limits. i hope that one day the american psychiatric association will finally take up the study of those people who delude themselves in this way, people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all. treatment for such afflicted individuals is sorely needed in this country, as so many people have completely lost their minds to the fantasy of religion. the 700 club though, is even more horrible as it rises to the legal definition of \\'cult\\' but due to the 700 club\\'s vast wealth (conned daily from the millions of americans locked in their deceitful grip) they are above the law in this country. for those of you who have seen the movie \"the matrix\" you know that movie was a metaphor for religion on earth: the evil ones who are at the top of each of the religions who drain the ones they have trapped and cruelly abuse for their own selfish purposes, and those millions who are held in a death sleep and slowly being drained of their life force represent those many people who belong to religions and who have lost all ability to perceive what is really going on around them. in less civil times, the good townsfolk would have run such monsters as those associated with the 700 club out of town with torches and pitchforks. but in today\\'s world where people have lost all choice in their choices of television that is presented to them, we have no way to rid ourselves of the 700 club plague. the television ratings system and the \"v\" chip on tv\\'s should also have a rating called \"r\" for religion, so that rational people and concerned parents could easily screen such vile intellectual and brutal emotional rape, such as presented by the 700 club every day all over our country, from themselves and their children. if you wish to see shakespeare\\'s masterpiece in its entirety, i suggest you find this bbc version. indeed it is overlong at four and a half hours but jacoby\\'s performance as hamlet and patrick stewart\\'s as claudius are well worth the effort. it never ceases to amaze me how clear \"hamlet\" is when you see it in its length and order as set down by the bard. every film version of \"hamlet\" has tinkered with its structure. olivier concentrated on hamlet\\'s indecision, gibson on his passions. jacoby is able to pull all of these aspects of hamlet\\'s character together with the aid of shakespeare\\'s full script. why does hamlet not kill claudius immediately? hamlet says \"i am very proud, revengeful, ambitious...\" hamlet is extremely upset, not only for his father\\'s death (and suspected murder), or his mother\\'s marriage to his uncle, but also, and mostly, because claudius has usurped the throne belonging to hamlet. he is furious at his mother for marrying claudius (marriages between royal kin is not unknown; done for political reasons) but that her marriage solidified claudius\\' claim to the throne before he could return from wittenburg to claim it for himself. he is, therefore, impotent to do anything about it. and this is true even after he hears his father\\'s ghost cry vengeance. he cannot simply kill the king or he will lose the throne in doing so. he must \"out\" the king\\'s secret and here is the tragedy! at the moment hamlet is successful in displaying claudius\\' guilt in public, he has opportunity to kill him and does not. why? he wants it all! he wants revenge, the throne and the damnation of claudius\\' soul in hell. hamlet overreaches himself in classic tragic form. his own hubris is his undoing. he kills polonius thinking it is claudius and the rest of the play spirals down to the final deaths of rosencrantz, guildenstern, ophelia, laertes, gertrude, claudius and hamlet himself. the golden door is the story of a sicilian family\\'s journey from the old world (italy) to the new world (america). salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in sicily, take the arduous journey across the raging seas, and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. in short, they believe that by risking everything for the new world their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. the imagery of the new world is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative. silver coins rain from heaven upon salvatore as he anticipates how prosperous he\\'ll be in the new world; carrots and onions twice the size of human beings are shown being harvested to suggest wealth and health, and rivers of milk are swam in and flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the new world will yield. all of this imagery is surrealistically interwoven with the characters and helps nicely compliment the gritty realism that the story unfolds to the audience. the contrast between this imagery versus the dark reality of the sicilian people helps provide hope while they\\'re aboard the ship to the new world. the voyage to the new world is shot almost in complete darkness, especially when the seas tempests roar and nearly kill the people within. the dark reality i referred to is the old world and the journey itself to the new world. the old world is depicted as somewhat destitute and primitive. this is shown as salvatore scrambles together to sell what few possessions he has left (donkeys, goats and rabbits) in order to obtain the appropriate clothing he needs to enter the new world. i thought it was rather interesting that these people believed they had to conform to a certain dress code in order to be accepted in the new world; it was almost suggesting that people had to fit a particular stereotype or mold in order to be recognized as morally fit. the most powerful image in the film was when the ship is leaving their homeland and setting sail for the new world. this shot shows an overhead view of a crowd of people who slowly seem to separate from one another, depicting the separation between the old and new worlds. this shot also suggested that the people were being torn away from all that was once familiar, wanted to divorce from their previous dark living conditions and were desirous to enter a world that held more promise. as later contrasted to how the new world visually looks, the old world seems dark and bleak as compared to the bright yet foggy new world. i thought it was particularly interesting that the statue of liberty is never shown through the fog at ellis island, but is remained hidden. i think this was an intentional directing choice that seemed to negate the purpose of what the statue of liberty stands for: \"give me your poor, your tired, your hungry\" seemed like a joke in regards to what these people had to go through when arriving at the new world. once they arrived in the americas, they had to go through rather humiliating tests (i.e. delousing, mathematics, puzzles, etc.) in order to prove themselves as fit for the new world. these tests completely changed the perspectives of the sicilian people. in particular, salvatore\\'s mother had the most difficult time subjecting herself to the rules and laws of the new world, feeling more violated than treated with respect. where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the new world would provide, the reality of what the new world required was disparaging and rude. salvatore doesn\\'t change much other than his attitude towards what he felt the new world would be like versus what the new world actually was seemed disappointing to him. this attitude was shared by mostly everyone who voyaged with him. their character arcs deal more with a cherished dream being greatly upset and a dark reality that had to be accepted. the film seems to make a strong commentary on preparing oneself to enter a heavenly and civilized society. cleanliness, marriage and intelligence are prerequisites. adhering to these rules is to prevent disease, immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating. perhaps this is a commentary on how america has learned from the failings of other nations and so was purposefully established to secure that these plagues did not infest and destruct. though the rules seemed rigid, they were there to protect and help the people flourish. nifty little episode played mainly for laughs, but with clever dollop of suspense. somehow a martian has snuck aboard a broken-down bus on its way to nowhere, but which passenger is it, (talk about your illegal immigrants!). all-star supporting cast, from wild-eyed jack elam (hamming it up shamelessly), to sexy jean willes (if she\\'s the martian, then i say let\\'s open the borders!), to cruel-faced john hoyt (the most obvious suspect), along with familiar faces john archer and barney phillips (and a nice turn from bill kendis as the bus driver). makes for a very entertaining half-hour even if the action is confined to a single set. i had before a feeling of mislike for all russian films. but, after seeing this film i havenâ´t. this is a unique masterpiece made by the best director ever lived in the ussr. he knows the art of film making, and can use it very well. if you find this movie: buy or copy it! i watched mask in the 80\\'s and it\\'s currently showing on fox kids in the uk (very late at night). i remember thinking that it was kinda cool back in the day and had a couple of the toys too but watching it now bores me to tears. i never realised before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really was. it\\'s just plain awful! it is no where near in the same league as the transformers, he-man or thundercats and was very quickly forgot by nearly everyone once it stopped being made. i only watch it on fox kids because ulysses 31 comes on straight after it (that\\'s if mask doesn\\'t put me to sleep first). one of the lesser 80\\'s cartoons that i hope to completely forget about again once it finishes airing on fox kids! phantasm ....class. phantasm ii.....awesome. phantasm iii.....erm.....terrible. even though i would love to stick up for this film, i quite simply can\\'t. the movie seems to have \"sold out\". first bad signs come when the video has trailers for other films at the start (something the others did not). also too many pointless characters, prime examples the kid (who is a crack shot, funny initially but soon you want him dead), the woman who uses karate to fight off the balls (erm not gonna work, or rather shouldn\\'t) and the blooming zombies (what the hell are they doing there, there no link to them in the other phatasms). also there is a severe lack of midgets running about. the only good bits are the cracking start and, of course, reggie b. (possible spoiler coming up) to me this film seems like a filler between ii and iv as extra characters just leave at the end so can continue with main 4 in iv. overall very, very disappointing. 3 / 10 ludicrous. angelic 9-year-old annakin turns into whiny brat 19-year-old annakin, who somehow seems appealing to amidala, 5 years his senior. now 22-year-old jedi warrior hero annakin has a couple of bad dreams, and so takes to slaughtering children, his friends, and the entire framework of his existence because a crazy old man convinced him a) his precious wife might really die, and b) only he can prevent this. ludicrosity squared. i think the people who like this movie are not paying attention. the story is ridiculous. the characters are unbelievable (literally, not the perverted sense of \"fantastic\", \"wonderful\", etc.). obi-wan kenobi was the wise and kind anchor for the entire series, but in the climax, he hacks off annakin\\'s legs, lets him burn in the lava, and leaves him to suffer. doesn\\'t anyone think that\\'s a little out of character? not to mention it was pretty stupid to take a chance on him living, as it turns out. i was expecting at least a story that showed consistent characters with plausible motivations. none of that here. the story could have been written by a 10 year old. oh yeah, the cgi is pretty cool. scotty (grant cramer, who would go on to star in the great b-movie \"killer klowns from outer space\") agrees to help three middle-aged guys learn how to \\'dialog\\' the ladies in this bad \\'80\\'s comedy. not bad as in \\'80\\'s lingo, which meant good. bad as in bad. with no likable characters, including, but not limited to, a kid who\\'s the freakiest looking guy since \"friday the 13th part 2\"\\' a girl who leads men on and then goes into hissy fits when they want to touch her, and the token fat slob, because after all what would an \\'80\\'s sex comedy be without a fat slob?? well this one has two. this movie is pretty much the bottom of the barrel of \\'80\\'s sex comedies. and then came the sequel thus deepening said proverbial barrel. my grade:d- eye candy: too numerous to count, you even see the freaky looking kid imagined with boobs at on point, think \"bachlor party\" but not as funny, and very disturbing. where i saw it: comcast moviepass if you keep rigid historical perspective out of it, this film is actually quite entertaining. it\\'s got action, adventure and romance, and one of the premiere casting match-ups of the era with errol flynn and olivia de havilland in the lead roles. as evident on this board, the picture doesn\\'t pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling. to get beyond that, one need only put aside the history book, and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. i know, i know, that\\'s hard to do when you consider custer\\'s last stand at the little big horn and it\\'s prominence in the history of post civil war america. so i guess there\\'s an unresolved quandary with the picture, no matter how you look at it. there\\'s a lot to take in here though for the picture\\'s two hour plus run time. custer\\'s arrival at west point is probably the first head scratcher, riding up as he does in full military regalia. the practical joke by sharp (arthur kennedy) putting him up in the major\\'s headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble. ironically, a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy, as in custer\\'s first meeting with libby bacon, and subsequent encounters that include tea reader callie (hattie mcdaniel). i hadn\\'t noticed it before in other films, but mcdaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the forties, mantan moreland. so much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been moreland hamming it up in a dress. with that in mind, the owl scene was a hoot too. as for flynn, it\\'s interesting to note that a year earlier, he portrayed j.e.b. stuart opposite ronald reagan\\'s depiction of general custer in \"santa fe trail\", both vying for the attention of none other than olivia de havilland. in that film, reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of custer that history remembers, while in flynn\\'s portrayal here it\\'s more than evident. but it doesn\\'t come close to that of richard mulligan\\'s take on the military hero in 1970\\'s \"little big man\". let\\'s just say that one was a bit over the top. the better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture. that and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story. most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival sharp just before riding into the little big horn, in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on one\\'s point of view. earlier, a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into custer\\'s character, when he stated - \"you take glory with you when it\\'s your time to go\". the film quickly gets to a major chase scene with ever increasing destruction. the first really bad thing is the guy hijacking steven seagal would have been beaten to pulp by seagal\\'s driving, but that probably would have ended the whole premise for the movie. it seems like they decided to make all kinds of changes in the movie plot, so just plan to enjoy the action, and do not expect a coherent plot. turn any sense of logic you may have, it will reduce your chance of getting a headache. i does give me some hope that steven seagal is trying to move back towards the type of characters he portrayed in his more popular movies. interesting and short television movie describes some of the machinations surrounding jay leno\\'s replacing carson as host of the tonight show. film is currently very topical given the public drama surrounding conan o\\'brien and jay leno. the film does a good job of sparking viewers\\' interest in the events and showing some of the concerns of the stakeholders, particularly of the nbc executives. the portrayal of ovitz was particularly compelling and interesting, i thought. still, many of the characters were only very briefly limned or touched upon, and some of the acting seemed perfunctory. nevertheless, an interesting story. any film about wwii made during wwii by a british production company has no latter-day peer in my opinion, respectfully. the confluence of so many things near and dear to my heart are in at dawn we dive: as a descendant of admiral horatio nelson and student of all aspects of world war two and particularly naval warfare, i favor depictions of subs and action in the north atlantic and especially those which include the german side of things. for those unacquainted with target priorities, an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here. the pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of the ealing, rank and british-gaumont studios back in the day: frankly i prefer its quieter, more cerebral approach for its humanity and realism that engages far better than any over-produced hollywood movie ever could. this reminds me of powell and pressburger\\'s the 49th parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive eric portman, a favorite of mine. john mills receives second billing and a smaller font in the titles, so this is clearly meant to be mr. portman\\'s film but the whole cast shines. as for the title sequence, am i the only one who is utterly charmed by gainsborough production\\'s lovely pre-cgi gainsborough girl? a brilliant horror film. utterly gruesome and very scary too. the thing is a remake from john carpenter, but please, do not let that put you off this film. it is simply brilliant. the start of the film has the alien\\'s spacecraft hurtling towards the earth centuries before mankind walked the planet with an explosion that unleashes the film\\'s title in amazing shining white and blue stating \\'the thing\\'. one of the best opening credits for a horror film ever. the cast of actors who play the twelve man science team are a joy to behold and the locations for the setting of their station in antartica is visually impressive on dvd widescreen. it must have been great in the cinema. i regret not seeing this on the big screen. kurt russell is excellent as macready, the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat a lethal shape changing monstrosity that has infiltrated their base. all the actors in this are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and tension as to who the thing has infected. my favourite scene in the whole film has to be when macready tests everyone thats still alive for infection, it is tense, scary and finally spectacular. i love it because its funny as well. special mention must go to rob bottin for his truly amazing make up effects and shape changing designs of the alien itself. if he didn\\'t get an oscar for best visual effects at the time then he damn well should have. this is also debatable as to whether this is john carpenter\\'s greatest film...its certainly a gruesome masterpiece. wait for a cold winter night. get some budweiser from the fridge. sit down and watch the thing, a horror masterpiece of flame throwing heroes fighting shape changing towers of gore and slime. utterly brilliant. ten out of ten. i absolutely love this film. everything about it. it almost felt like watching me and my friends on screen. the way this movie was filmed was a pure masterpiece, very original and creative. i related to these characters and even had the same thoughts as some. i\\'m really glad i ran across this movie. if only there were more genius\\' like justin out there! no one can say i wasn\\'t warned as i have read the reviews (both user & external), but like most of us attracted to horror movies... curiosity got this cat. (come on, we all scream at the people in the movie not to go into the dark room, but you know that\\'s horror aficionados are always dying to know what\\'s in there even if we know it\\'ll be bad). the bottom line is that this movie left me angry. not because it pretends to be real (who cares...gimmicks are allowed), or because the actors and dialogue are so lame (is this an unusual event in horror movies?) or even because the movie is so bad (and i am being polite here). what really got me mad is that the film is not only a rip off of bwp, but also a half-hearted lazy rip off at that. i don\\'t believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could outdo bwp then kudos to them, but they didn\\'t even try. the movie was made with little effort or care and that is the most unforgivable sin in horror (or any) movie! a new way to enjoy goldsworthy\\'s work, rivers and tides allows fans to see his work in motion. watching goldsworthy build his pieces, one develops an appreciation for every stone, leaf, and thorn that he uses. goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, the rivers, and the tides inspires and affects his work. although, i was happy the film covered the majority of goldsworthy\\'s pieces (no snowballs), i do feel it was a bit long. the film makers did a wonderful job of bringing goldsworthy\\'s work to life, and created a beautiful film that was a joy to watch. if you liked william hickey in \"prizzi\\'s honor\", he resurrects his character, as don anthony in \"mob boss\". this is a very weak \"godfather\" satire with few laughs. stuart whitman looks perplexed as to what he\\'s doing in this schlock-fest? morgan fairchild\\'s performance is one of the better efforts in the movie, and that alone is not a good sign for sure. eddie deezen vacillates between \"three stooges\" slapstick and a bad woody allen imitation. fatally flawed, \"mob boss\" is so derivative that boredom quickly overcomes comedy and the film drags on with car chases, hidden weapons in a restaurant bathroom, and numerous other nonsense. - merk i have seen most, if not all of the laurel & hardy classic films. i have always enjoyed there comical stupidly, even after watching it over and over again. this new film attempts to bring back the classic with two new actors who resemble both laurel & hardy, however fails miserably for various reasons. one of which is how out of place their cloths are (still early 20th century) however are both portrayed in the 90\\'s setting. some of the former dialogue was brought back, however it also fails miserably to come close to the classic series. this film could very well be the worst film i have ever seen and should be pulled off the shelf and locked away forever. the real laurel & hardy are surly spinning in their graves at such a bad imitation. i just started watching the show around july. i found it by mistake, i was channel surfing during a vacation. it is a great show, i just wish it wasn\\'t on so late at night. it\\'s on at 12:30 am. as a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time. i read some comments. i did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60\\'s and not believing that this stuff can happen. i grew up in the 60\\'s. i\\'m hispanic and i had a \"white\" boyfriend plus we had black friends in high school. i believe people get along because of their interests and personalities and it has nothing to do with being a certain race or color. i can\\'t wait till the show goes on dvd so i can buy it. this way i can see it from the beginning. this film is well cast, often silly and always funny. lemmon and matthau work their tag team magic to perfection. brent spiner is just a riot as the egotistical tyrant of a cruise director. from the first \"hare krishna\" to the last \"you ought pay him fifty bucks for calling you two studs\", i thought this was a totally entertaining fun comedy i have just given a 10 for thieves highway, i mention this for two reasons one to prove i\\'m not a git who only gives bad reviews but 2 because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the night. we all know pretty woman is a chick flick but you can\\'t avoid them all, they\\'ll eventually get you. pretty woman for me does two things, two terrible horrible ghastly things, firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer, you know with absolutely great friends, leg warmers lots of giggling, borrowing each others make up. you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this is a street walker prostitute we\\'re talking about here, has a great life, she\\'s healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament. my feeling is this \\'happy hooker\\' type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character, which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it? if i make a film about a chef but don\\'t want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place? by bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have, what a cop out, really really lame. secondly, \\'pretty woman\\' insults romance itself, edward lewis played by richard gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this \\'lady\\' that is without his plastic friend, yep don\\'t leave home without it, especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another, even when he first meets her it\\'s the lotus esprit turbo that does all the work, necklaces here diamonds there limos over there, money money money, where\\'s the charm? where\\'s the charisma, don\\'t mention that attempt at the piano please. girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most. guys who like this film will not even have realized that old eddy has less charm than a calculator, as they probably don\\'t either so it wont have registered. more importantly anyone who likes this film will hate \\'thieves highway\\' a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject. i\\'ll finish on a song: pretty woman hangin round the street pretty woman, the kind i like to treat pretty woman, i don\\'t believe you you\\'re not the truth no one could spend as much as you mercy pretty woman, wont you pardon me pretty woman, i couldn\\'t help but see pretty woman, and you look lovely as can be do you lack imagination just like me pretty woman, shop a while pretty woman, talk a while pretty woman, sell your smile to me pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah pretty woman, look my way pretty woman, say you\\'ll stay with me..and i\\'ll pay you..i\\'ll treat you right this movie was terrible. the plot was terrible and unbelievable. i cannot recommend this movie. where did this movie come from? this movie was not funny and wasted the talent of some great actors and actresses including: gary sinise, kathy bates, joey lauren adams, and jennifer tilly. i strongly dislike this show. i mean, like, basically everyone at that school is perfect, and rich, and i doubt a boarding school would look as cool as that. and why do they suddenly allow girls into the school? isn\\'t that just a little weird? anyways, jamie lynn spears cannot act. she always has the same facial expression, which really annoys me. she is basically emotionless, and all the guys seem to like her. and shouldn\\'t chase tell her he likes her? its not that hard! really! none of this show is real life, and she isn\\'t \"a girl like me\" because majority of the regular girls do not go to boarding school, do not have designer clothes, and do not live by the beach. fake fake fake. normally i don\\'t like series at all. they\\'re all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fast. these series however, are well played, the story follows through all episodes and even if you miss one, the story will still be catching your mind. the episodes are all filmed on a hospital and takes you further and further in to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lies just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital. holy sh*t this was god awful. i sat in the theater for for an hour and ten minutes and i thought i was going to gouge out my eyes much in the manor oedipus rex. dear god. this movie deserves no more credit than anything done by a middle school film buff. please save your money, this movie can offer you nothing. unless you enjoy sideshows and sleeping in movie theaters. you know, h3ll, bring your girlfriend and make things interesting. you will be the only ones there anyway. f@ck this slide show. ye be warned. i recommend not watching this. hello. how are you? i\\'m pretty good. enjoying this day? i am. this comment was one-hundred times more fun than pretending to watch this daym movie. this is sad. this movie is without a doubt a perfect 10/10.. for all you people out there who are rating this film low grades because it has no \"good plot\" or anything like that, thats ridiculous, saying that a jackie chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot! you watch jackie chan for the fight scenes, for the action its not so much concentrated on a good story or anything like that, if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other american films from that era and even later you will realize that jackie chan\\'s movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while american movies had good plots but shitty action scenes compared to what jackie chan was doing at the time. porn is watched for the porn, jackie chan is watched for the action, i think you people are rating it bad because there\\'s no plot because you think thats how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained. sure the middle of the movie was boring, very boring, but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that. this did change the way how american action movies were created, they have even stollen scenes from this movie. if you want a true man, a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of jackie chan\\'s, hes pure in everyway. he literally makes american movies look like a walk in the park, and even in todays movies. american movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more. police story and many other jackie chan films are pieces of work of a true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do. a masterpiece i saw this at the london film festival last night, apparently the shorter version. james mcnally\\'s summary of the content of the film is very good. nossiter very deftly blends his investigation of the wine business into wider concerns about globalisation, homogenisation, the effect of the mass media, the power of capital and the need for diversity. the film is shot on hand-held dv which some might find offputting, but which does enable nossiter to catch people off guard on a number of occasions which probably would not have been possible using more conventional equipment. despite the sprawling feel of the film, the editing is very sharp, not only giving us a parade of the world\\'s dogs, but also undercutting a number of interviewees\\' comments with somewhat contradictory visual images, and giving others sufficient rope to hang themselves. to a degree this evoked michael moore\\'s recent work (although nossiter operates in a more subtle way), but probably the roots of the film go back to marcel ophuls\\' \"the sorrow and the pity\", both in the way the film is constructed and in the emergence of \\'salt of the earth\\' french peasants as the stars. de montille pere et fils were present at the lff screening and answered questions afterwards. we do indeed all need a little disorder - bravo hubert! overall an excellent film with implications that go way beyond the world of wine into the way we construct ourselves as people, and organise our world. i can\\'t believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of 6! it is barely watchable and unbelievably boring, certainly one of the worst films i have seen in a long, long time. in a no-budget way, it reminded me of star wars episodes i and ii for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train wreck. this film should be avoided at all costs. it\\'s one of those \"festival films\" that only please the pseudo-intellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it makes it \"different\", therefore good. bad film-making is not \"different\", it\\'s just bad film-making. this movie really woke me up, like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber. this guy john (ben chaplin) leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial english town, until the stunningly gorgeous, wild, girl-to-die-for nadia (nicole kidman), ordered by email from russia, enters his life to become his beloved wife, by johns plan. however a glitch turns up - nadia does not speak a word of johns language. although calm and emotionless on the outside, john becomes so interested in beautiful nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service, he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process. what happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor john from his slumber of a decently-paid safe-feeling clerk into a decision-making decently thinking action figure, giving the viewer a subliminal message \"you would have probably acted likewise\". kidman, cassel & kassovitz make a great team acting russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing, \"almost\" only due to the slight accent present in their russian dialogues, however slight enough to amaze a native russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right. nicole kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles, at least from the cultural background. the pace of the film is fast and captivating, and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear, you rather feel that you\\'re in the middle of the plot, and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out. my advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy. to sum it up, it has an unusual plot, great acting, and ideas below the surface. like the idea of the \"rude awakening\" from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a society\\'s machine, the life which members of the fight club were so keen to quit and the machine of which pink floyd sings (\"welcome to the machine!\"). i bet that in the end, john was rather off with sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all. thank you, writers, for the great story, and everyone else for this great movie! please make a sequel! and you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever, because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 99.9999 percent of the potential viewers, i am sure of it. ed wood rides again. the fact that this movie was made should give any young aspiring film maker hope. any screenplay you might have thought of using to line a litterbox or a birdcage should now not seem that bad. do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of tylenol or rolaids. watching this movie made me realize that boa vs. python was not that bad after all. it probably would have been better to do this movie in claymation as at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film. it is understandable why this director has so many aliases. there is a bright side to watching this movie in that if you can get someone to bring you a bag of chips, then you can eat your way out of the cocoon of cheese that surrounds you enabling you to make your toward your tv set\\'s cocoon of cheese that surrounds it. this sports a nice, deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk. the first third of this movie was nothing but talk, and more talk. most of that was a bunch of women bitching about everything to each other. the first five listed actors in here are women so that verifies that it\\'s really a \"chick flick\" and little else. this probably plays on the lifetime network. there was a quick murder scene and then more talk. by halfway through, they had lost me. by the way, sally field looked about 15 years old in here. i think this movie has got it all. it has really cool music that i can never get out of my head. it has cool looking characters. is really funny(you know, the kind that you\\'ll crack up on the ground and you\\'ll keep saying the funny parts over every day for three weeks).despite the bad acting, bad cgi, and bad story(about cops going after a robot), its really cool. its one of those movies you and all of your family can watch, get together, eat pizza, laugh like crazy, and watch it two more times. there are so many funny parts, like when kurt was trying to get edison\\'s attention and gave him the finger, and then threw a paint ball gun at him so they could play paint ball. on that part, i kept saying \"remember, remember?\"to my cousins who saw it and showed them what happened. there was also a really funny part when edision ran into the room and kurt was there(just before they fought) and kurt was talking about his \"strange dream\" and how he was \"superman\". i loved that part, although it has been a while since i saw it, so i don\\'t remember that part. everything the actors said were funny, like how kurt says, \"i worship you, like a god!\" to the robot. although there was some bad things, in all it was a great movie. man, i can\\'t stop laughing. i wish i had that movie. ); howard (kevin kline) teaches english at the high school in a small indiana city. he is finally getting married to emily (joan cusack), much to his parents delight. the town is abuzz, too, because one of its own, cameron (matt dillon) has been nominated for an acting oscar. everyone, including howard and emily, is watching the academy awards on television as cameron is declared the winner! in his acceptance speech, cameron announces that he was able to fulfill his role as a gay military man, in part, because of lessons he learned from a gay teacher he had in high school. you guessed it, its howard! but, howard has never \"come out\"; in fact, he believes he is straight! with the whole town, and members of the media, waiting and observing the happenings, will howard and emily go ahead and get married? or, is howard truly gay and realize he can not go through with the ceremony? this is a wonderful, funny, and humane film about a gay man and his situation. as the man-who-did-not-realize-he-was-gay, kline is excellent and touching. the rest of the cast is equally fine, with cusack a stitch as the mixed-up fiancã© and dillon, bob newhart, debbie reynolds, tom selleck, and others on hand to delight the audience as well. the costumes are very nice and the setting in the lovely indiana heartland is beautiful. then, too, the script, the direction, and the production are very, very nice. but, the insightful, humorous, and the thoughtful look at the gay population is the film\\'s best asset, no doubt. for those who would be offended by a gay-themed film, yes, just skip over this one. but, for everyone who wants to laugh heartily, and gain a better understanding of the gay situation at the same time, this is definitely the best film out there. when the opening shot is u.s. marines seriously disrespecting the u.s. flag, a movie has a tough road ahead, but unfortunately it was downhill from there. there is a military adviser credited, who is also apparently a retired u.s. marine, making it even more baffling that this incredible breach of protocol, and law, went unnoticed. even more baffling is the way they simply glossed over how a marine is reported kia, then buried, in very short order, without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body, or if there even was a body. the u.s. government is still finding the missing from wwii, and it takes months to identify the remains. military shot down remain mia for months or years and are only declared kia when the remains have been positively identified, or after years of red tape. here we are expected to believe that it happens within a matter of days or weeks. maybe this happens in denmark, but not in the u.s. clearly none of the people involved ever had the slightest involvement with, or respect for, the u.s. military. beyond that, there are a number of other utterly laughable moments when characters come up with zingers out of nowhere. there must have been some really extended meetings between auteur and actors as they struggled to find their motivation for such hogwash. having a script that worked might have helped, but this one seems to have been made up on the spot, working from cliffs notes. there\\'s no way to know if the script was this awful originally, or if it was the auteur, or the middle-management kids at the studio who bear responsibility. either way, this is an awful movie that should have never been made. we usually think of the british as the experts at rendering great adventure from the imperial age, with the likes of the four feathers (1939) and zulu, simply because the imperial age was, for the most part, british. here, in the wind and the lion, we see a wonderful rendering of america\\'s own imperial age. america\\'s projection of power under teddy roosevelt is the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who, despite her gentility, is smitten by the rough, manly nobility of her captor, who in turn is disarmed by her beauty and scorn. (politically correct prigs eager to see some slight of \"native\" peoples or cultures can rest assured, that the way arabs and muslims are depicted here is far more flattering than the way their modern counterparts depict themselves on the current world stage.) what makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy - and vivid history. though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be sean connery\\'s noble brigand, candace bergen\\'s feisty heroine, john huston\\'s wily john hay or steve kanaly\\'s spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, roosevelt\\'s \"big stick\". there is a transcendent scene at the end, when the little boy is symbolically swept away by the dashing moor on his white steed. this is high adventure at its best. i had been looking forward to seeing dreamgirls for quite a while...what with all it\\'s raving reviews, nominations and media attention. and i must say, the first quarter of the movie was good! it really portrayed the black music scene back then. however, as the movie wore on, me and my whole family were bored out of our wits. the singing just kept coming, one after the other. i mean seriously, just one more music number and it would have broke even with rent. furthermore, i noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters; i just didn\\'t care what happened to them! even when eddie murphy\\'s character died of a drug overdose, i knew i should have been sad, but i just couldn\\'t feel any emotion for that character. the characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot, but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me in. finally, the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care, which goes along with the lack of character development. this movie reminded me of a copy-cat movie based on ray, chicago, and rent (ray and chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion). overall i think this movie would best suit someone who doesn\\'t really care about an overall story, yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances. one of starewicz\\'s longest and strangest short films follows a toy dog in search of an orange after becoming animated by the tear of the mother of a girl who longs for an orange. the dog comes upon an orange after falling out of the back of a car on his way to be sold, but at night must protect the orange when he comes enters a devilish nightclub featuring many bizarre and scary characters. with the help of a stuffed cat, the dog gets the orange back to the little girl and she is saved from a terrible scurvy death. the mascot features new techniques i have not yet seen in starewicz\\'s films. the addition of sync sound and a mixture of live action with the stop-motion animation makes for a new twist on starewicz\\'s old style of puppetry. live scenes of moving cars and people\\'s feet walking by as a puppet sits on the concrete sidewalk is impressive and fresh. the honking of cars and cries of street vendors is noteworthy due to the fact that small studio shifts to sound were costly and starewicz\\'s utilization of the new technology seems like old hat. new puppet characters in this film are frightening contributions to the devil\\'s club scene. twigss and newspaper shreds come to life. skeletons of dead birds lay eggs which hatch skeleton chicks. characters come flying in from all over on pats and pans and rocking horses. a new editing technique uses quick zooms which are accomplished through editing to speed up the pace of what before might have been a slow scene. overall, starewicz is able to update his style of film-making to meet the demands of a new audience making this film one of the best examples of his work. nice character development in a pretty cool milieu. being a male, i\\'m probably not qualified to totally understand it, but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive victorian environment from the start. it isn\\'t as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher. what makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters. each has their own \"thing\" that they contend with. once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs, they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion. what i enjoyed about this movie is that it didn\\'t go for cheap comedy when it could have. it didn\\'t try to pound a lesson into us. the people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light. i did have a little trouble with the alfred molina character having such an epiphany so quickly, but, within this world, it needed to happen. good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people. prussic gas, a murderer donning a red clansman suit and hood wielding a white whip, and the murders of college school girls at the hands of paid convicts enlisted by a mysterious mastermind who keeps his face hidden within an office containing aquariums of turtles and fish. the inspectors at scotland yard, higgins(ijoachim fuchsberger)and his superior sir john(siegfried schã¼renberg)certainly have their hands full with this case. it all seems to center around student ann portland(uschi glas), who, when she turns 21, is to inherit a great deal of wealth. the girls who are targeted share a room with ann, but the reason for their murders remains a mystery sy\\'s finest must figure out. the staff of the girls\\' dormitory all seem to be hiding something and certain members of the faculty are falling prey to the killer in the red monk robe disguise, talented enough to precisely strangle the necks of those attacked with the whip. two prisoners are commissioned by a mystery man to use the newly created toxic gas created by a scientist murdered at the beginning of the film during what was supposed to be a monetary exchange for his creation. it\\'s a clever scheme where a driver, greaves(gã¼nter meisner)meets the convicts(..who hide in a barrel)who are assisted by a corrupt prison guard. taken blindfolded to the secret room of the mastermind, he gives them orders on who to kill and how. uncovering this operation is a top priority for higgins and sir john for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regards to the murders and why they are happening. under suspicion are girls\\' dormitory headmistress, her author brother, a sweaty, incredibly nervous chemistry teacher, a snooping gardener, and the bannister. some are red herrings until they are disposed of, throwing the viewer for a loop each time until the real mastermind is discovered. the ending features multiple twists. out of the krimi films i\\'ve seen, the college girl murders is the closest to a giallo with it\\'s colorful killer, a convoluted plot yielding lots of surprises and potential suspects, & sordid shenanigans between adults and the college girls at the dormitory. i think you can also see the influence of james bond on this particular krimi film with the villain mastermind\\'s secret hideout with an alligator pit(..which isn\\'t used), the fake bible/water pistol, when opened, fires the gas into the face of startled victims, the greaves\\' royles royce which has latches that cause flaps to darken the windows without revealing the passenger in the back seat, and the peep holes used to spy on the girls in their rooms and while swimming. many might consider sir john a liability due to his bumbling, buffoonish behavior and how he often undermines higgins\\' abilities to get at the truth(..perhaps poking fun at know-it-all british inspectors who harm a case more than solve it)..i felt he was used as comedy relief, particularly with his attempts at psychoanalyzing suspects and potential victims, often misunderstanding what are told to him. higgins, using the skills adopted over his years as an investigator, instead follows the clues/facts, often avoiding sir john as much as possible. capable direction by the reliable alfred vohrer who keeps the pace humming at a nice speed, and the screenplay is full of interesting characters and lurid content..the fact that so many of the adults surrounding the dormitory are suspect, any of them might be the one wielding the whip or calling the shots behind those murdered girls\\' executions. i\\'d say this may be one of the best(..if not the best)examples of the krimi genre, for it keeps you guessing, always one more ace up it\\'s sleeve..the revelations unearthed at the very end are quite eye-opening(..and, you even get a literal unmasking of the real mastermind pulling the strings to top it all off). i was very lucky to see this film as part of the melbourne international film festival 2005 only a few days ago. i must admit that i am very partial to movies that focus on human relations and especially the ones which concentrate on the tragic side of life. i also love the majority of scandinavian cinematic offerings, there is often a particular deep quality in the way the story unfolds and the characters are drawn. character building in this film is extraordinary in its details and its depth. this is despite the fact that we do encounter quite a number of characters all with very particular personal situations and locations within their community. the audience at the end of the screening was very silent and pensive. i am still playing some of those scenes in my mind and i am still amazed at their power and meaningfulness. this movie is really bad. most of it looks like it was filmed either in a park or a basement. there\\'s a giant spider but all we see of it is one leg. there are some worms that live in a cave that are just cheap sock puppets with cardboard teeth. and the plot is a bunch of post-apocalyptic mumbo jumbo that makes no sense at all. the whole thing is just laughable. i think this is one hell of a movie...........we can see steven fighting around with his martial art stuff again and like in all segal movies there\\'s a message in it, without the message it would be one of many action/fighting movies but the message is what makes segal movies great and special. i saw this movie in the theater, and was thoroughly impressed by it. then again, that was when claire danes was a good actress, not the foolish, arrogant, hollywood-ized bitch she is today. anyway, this film really struck me as one of the more raw, realistic, beautiful friendship films. how far would you really go for your best friend? i was moved to tears at the end, and still tear up when i watch it now (i own it). i remember as soon as i left the theater, i called my best friend and sobbed to her how much i loved her. this is a great film to watch with your best girlfriend. however be prepared for the almost certain conversation afterward where she turns to you and asks if you\\'d do something like that for her.... i\\'ve seen this film literally over 100 times...it\\'s absolutely jam-packed with entertainment!!! powers boothe gives a stellar performance. as a fan of actors such as william shatner (impulse, 1974) and ron liebmann (up the academy, 1981)i never thought an actor could capture the \"intensity\" like shatner and liebmann in those roles, until i saw boothe as jim jones! as far as i\\'m concerned, powers boothe is jim jones...this film captures his best performance!!! the three main characters are all hopeless, and yet you only feel sorry for one of them: ernesto, hopelessly devoted to mercedes. this was part of the frustration: screaming at mercedes to get a clue and ditch the no-good harry, to no avail. then there\\'s the satisfaction: steve buscemi has a great part as a transvestite, and harvey keitel\\'s moving story of his indignity playing a gorilla for a cheap tv movie is incredible. when you least expect it, quentin tarintino is doing half a monologue, and anthony quinn turns ernesto into a wealthy man. time and again great moments appear in the story, but in the end it\\'s hard to know what to feel about this movie. it doesn\\'t have a happy ending, or even a complete one, but it somehow feels right. this movie is strange, but then so am i; no wonder i liked it. reese witherspoon first outing on the big screen was a memorable one. she appears like a fresh scrubbed face \"tween\" slight and stringy, but undeniably reese. i have always liked her as an actor, and had no idea she started this young with her career, go figure. i actually gained some respect for reese to know who she was so early on. i say that because whenever i have watched her perform, the characters thus far, in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona that lived with that character, quite nicely in fact. anyway, my first film experience with reese was the little red riding hood parody reese did with kiefer sutherland, somehow i assumed that was her first time up \"at bat\" not so, well done reese this game ranks above all so far. i had the honor of playing mine on ps2 so the graphics were really good. the voice acting was above standard. the difficulty level is just right. wesker has to be the best characters in the re series in my opinion. the story amazed me and took many different twist that i wasn\\'t expecting. the only rating this game deserves is great. this movie is not worth anything. i mean, if you want to watch this kind of stuff, flip to hollywood movies! this totally is a disgrace to the bollywood name. neal n nikki seriously sucked! never watch this movie. as for the actors, it appears the acting genes skipped a generation. tanisha couldn\\'t have worn less and uday chopra obviously was just picked because he was the director\\'s spoiled son. (all of that halla re was amazingly stupid) the songs are eh, and i hope the director did not spend to much money on it...... bottom line, i hated the movie. do not let your kids watch it, and if you have it in your house it is a stupid movie so discard it! buy the cd, if you must. (as i said, the songs are eh.) at least it is better then the movie. this is yet another western about a greedy cattle baron looking to push out small ranchers and farmers. it\\'s certainly all been done before and since. but the violent men is something special. what makes it special is barbara stanwyck playing the role of vixen as she often did in her later films. she\\'s married to the crippled edward g. robinson who\\'s the cattle baron here, but robinson is crippled and there is some hint that his injuries may have left him impotent. no matter to barbara, whose needs are being met by her brother-in-law brian keith. that doesn\\'t sit well with either dianne foster who is robinson and stanwyck\\'s daughter, nor with lita milan who is keith\\'s mexican girl friend. the infidelity subplot almost takes over the film, but glenn ford as the stalwart small rancher who is a civil war veteran come west for his health manages to hold his own here. he\\'s every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of pushing once too often. i almost expect those famous words from wild bill elliott to come out of ford\\'s mouth, \"i\\'m a peaceable man.\" would have been very applicable in the vioilent men. the fifties was the age of the adult western, themes were entering into horse operas that hadn\\'t been explored before. the following year glenn ford would do another western, jubal, one of his best which also explores infidelity as a plot component. there\\'s enough traditional western stuff in the violent men and plenty for those who are addicted to soap operas as well. apparently, the mutilation man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self-mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood. i use the word \\'apparently\\' because without listening to a director andy copp\\'s commentary (which i didn\\'t have available to me) or reading up on the film prior to watching, viewers won\\'t have a clue what it is about. gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching the mutilation man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real-life footage, but unless they\\'re also fond of pretentious, headache-inducing, experimental art-house cinema, they\\'ll find this one a real chore to sit through. 82 minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dis-chordant sound, terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue, this mind-numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one\\'s sanity: if you\\'ve still got all your marbles, you\\'ll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead (i watched the whole thing, but am well aware that i\\'m completely barking!). this movie was absolutely pathetic. a pitiful screenplay and lack of any story just left me watching three losers drool over bikini babes. at times i felt like i was watching an episode of beavis and butthead. i couldn\\'t even sit through the whole movie. emran hashmi disappoints, and hrshitta bhatt is not impressive at all. celina jaitley was not bad. the only worthwhile part of the film is the spoof on anu malik and his obsession of shayaris. it was pretty hilarious. the songs \"sini ne\" and its remix version were really good. you can always count on emran lip-locking and lip-synching a chartbuster. all in all, it seems emran doesn\\'t have a good script from the bhatts to back him up this time. i feel the niiiiiight heat! i feel your heeaaaaaaaaaart-beat! something ain\\'t right!\" theme song written by b.j. cook from skylark- david foster\\'s old band and wife. she also wrote the memorable theme from cbc\\'s \"airwaves.\" oh night heat! what a program! well-written, well-acted and totally classic. crime solvers and a good team and a dash of humour at the end. i\\'d like to think this is really what detectives do/did. giambone was a real favourite! on a canadian tip, i learned every canadian actor\\'s name and style from guest spots done on night heat. everyone passed through the night heat set and like law & order, it was story-driven so you could just watch and enjoy without a lot of character melodrama. this movie fails miserably on every level. i have an idea, let\\'s take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east. maybe if we\\'re lucky they\\'ll all be shot and killed and we won\\'t have to ever have our time wasted by them again. did i mention that i have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life? my god, i can\\'t think of anything i\\'ve ever seen that was this bad. i\\'d rather watch ishtar 25 times in a row than sit through 10 minutes of this sorry excuse for a film. if i ever happen to meet anyone who was involved in this film, i\\'ll spit in their face and then beat them senseless. that\\'s my two cents. yes i\\'ll say before i start commenting, this movie is incredibly underrated. sharon stone is great in her role of catherine trammell as is morrissey as dr glass. he is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sports star. glass is drawn into a seductive game that trammel uses to manipulate his mind. the acting was good (apart from thewlis) stone really has a talent with this role. she\\'s slick, naughty and seductive and doesn\\'t look a day older than she did in the first.she really impressed me(like in casino). morrisey was also good. he showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it. thewlis however was lame. he ruined his character and was over-the-top the whole way. he really sucked. overall, this movie not as good the first but stone is a hoot to watch. just ignore thewlis. based on a edgar rice burroughs novel, at the earth\\'s core provides little more than means to escape and give your brain a rest. a victorian scientist dr. abner perry(peter cushing)invents a giant burrowing machine, which he and his american partner(doug mcclure)use to corkscrew their way deep into the earth to explore what mysteries it may hold. they soon discover a lost world of subhuman creatures having conflict with prehistoric monsters. cushing comes across as an absent minded professor to the point of being annoying. instead of being a bold adventurer, he comes across effeminate. on the other hand mcclure overacted enough to make himself also laughable. caroline munro plays the pretty princess dia that refuses to leave her world near the center of the earth. also in the cast are: godfrey james, cy grant and michael crane. i have seen this film at least 100 times and i am still excited by it, the acting is perfect and the romance between joe and jean keeps me on the edge of my seat, plus i still think bryan brown is the tops. brilliant film. this show makes absolutely no sense. every week, two ladies go to an estate to do some gardening, and every week without fail, they somehow stumble upon a murder. because everyone who owns a big house with a large garden is involved in a murder, right? but even if they did somehow happen to stumble upon murder after murder, wouldn\\'t the smart thing to do be to tell the police? you know, the people who can actually do something about it... but every week, these two fools go around, polluting evidence, committing crimes of their own, and, in some cases, causing more murders. once they do miraculously solve the murders, there is no way the murderer could ever be convicted. all the evidence has been sabotaged. and you\\'d think people who are covering up murders would think not to hire these two, wouldn\\'t you? yay! we\\'ve solved the murder! now like every other week, let\\'s go and confront the murderer ourselves and, with no back-up, tell them that we know about it. there is no way we could get ourselves into any danger, is there? rosemary and thyme is one of the worst shows on television, and certainly the most ridiculous. this movie was so bad it was funny! for awhile there i thought i was actually watching a parody of a bad movie (a la \"for your consideration\"). the \"cliffhanger\" scene at the end had me laughing until my insides hurt. the script was dreadful enough, but coupled with sean young\\'s terrible acting -- especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail (complete with flashbacks) while dangling off a cliff -- makes it a truly classically bad movie worth watching! in fact the fakey shots in this scene reminded me of an ed wood movie. i still can\\'t believe how this thing got made. first of all, how did such a bad script get the green light? how did star actors get attached? were they at low points in their careers? questions, questions. meryl streep is such a genius. well, at least as an actress. i know she\\'s been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents, but she nails the accent every time. her performance as lindy chamberlain was inspiring. mrs. chamberlain, as portrayed here, was not particularly likable, nor all that smart. but that just makes streep\\'s work all the more remarkable. i think she is worth all 10 or so of her oscar nominations. about the film, well, there were a couple of interesting things. i don\\'t know much about australia, but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story. i had largely missed this when i first saw the film some years ago, but it came through loud and clear yesterday. and it seems the australian press is just as accomplished at misery-inducing pursuit and overkill as their american colleagues. a pretty good film. a bit different. grade: b airport 4\\' is basically a slopped together mess for universal studios to try and work a new twist - the concorde supersonic airliner - into their \\'disaster-in-the-sky\\' formula. bogged down with unintentional humor, the best of which is when george kennedy sticks his hand out of concorde\\'s window at supersonic speed to fire a flare gun at a heat-seeking missile following the aircraft\\'s flight path, and the simple fact that these dumb passengers keep re-boarding the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problems in the air. many stars in this one including robert wagner, sylvia kristel, alain delon, and martha raye as a nervous passenger. not really related to the other \\'airport\\' films. supposedly a \"social commentary\" on racism and prison conditions in the rural south of the 1970\\'s, \"nightmare\" is full of bad southern stereotypes, complete with phoney accents. not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most american southerners, this tawdry piece of work comes off as just a thinly-disguised \"babe in prison\" movie--especially in its uncut original version. nevertheless, acting is generally above average and the late chuck connors, in particular, does a good job of making viewers hate him--even though he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes. there\\'s also a change-of-pace role for the late robert reed, who appears as the lecherous warden, and tina louise (previously ginger of \"gilligan\\'s island\") made a rather believable sadistic prison guard. my grade: d. ok, i bought this film from woolworths for my friend for a joke present on his birthday, because the front cover had a sexual innuendo in it. but we decided it to watch it anyway. just for hilarity purposes. and i\\'m sorry, but this has got to be, one of the worst films in history. it began off alright, and we thought \"ok this might actually be ok\". but after about 10 minutes, we were sadly mistaken. it began when the \"mysterious paint baller\" turned out to be the most obvious character, the scouser/australian (i say that because he had an accent which couldn\\'t be identified), who\\'s acting might i just say, was abysmal. then it got to the end, and by that time, we had all lost the will to live. the paint ball finals. the only thing i did like about this plot is that they didn\\'t actually win, but annoyingly enough they won by default. and i know this has nothing to do with it, but the name the team were given was just awful. critical damage. i mean they could of picked a more awesome name, like \"the destroyers of the anti-christ\" or something. or that\\'s what the film should of been called anyway. insignificant and low-brained (haha!) 80\\'s horror like there are thirteen in a dozen, yet it can be considered amusing if you watch it in the right state of mind. the special effects are tacky, the acting atrocious and the screenplay seems to miss a couple of essential paragraphs! \"the brain\" takes place in a typical quiet-american town setting, where every adolescent works in the same diner and where the cool-kid in high school flushes cherry bombs down the toilet. it is here that a tv-guru named dr. blake and his adorable pet-brain begin their quest for nation-wide mind controlling. under the label of \"independent thinkers\", a giant cheesy brain sends out waves through television sets and forces innocent viewers to kill! how cool is that? now, it\\'s up to the meadowvale teen-rebel to save the world! the funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where dr. blake and his monstrous brain actually come from. there are obvious references towards extraterrestrial life but that\\'s about it. meh, who needs a background in a movie like this, really? there\\'s not that much bloodshed unfortunately and the \"evil\" brain looks like an over-sized sock-puppet. the only more or less interesting element for horror buffs is taking a look at the cast and crew who made this movie. director ed hunt and writer barry pearson are the same men who made \"bloody birthday\" (guilty pleasure of mine) and \"plague\". both those are much better movies and they wisely decided to resign the film industry. the most familiar face in the cast unquestionably is the great david gale, whom horror fans will worship forever for his role in re-animator. a girl named christine kossak provides the nudity-factor and she\\'s obviously a great talentâ… she has exactly 3 movies on her repertoire of which this is her \"masterpiece\". in her debut, she was credited as \\'runaway model\\' and in \"3 men and a baby\", her character is referred to as \\'one of jack\\'s girls\\'. i really wonder how she feels about her career as an actressâ… does anyone remember the alternative comedy show the comic strip presents . one edition featured charles bronson ( robbie coltrane ) being interviewed about his new movie glc : \" it\\'s about a man , an ordinary man whose wife and family gets wiped out by creeps and i have to hunt them down and kill them in a sadistic and graphic manner \" \" and after glc what next for bronson ? \" \" we\\'re using a new angle . my family don\\'t get wiped out but i go after creeps just the same \" this accurately describes the evil that men do . it\\'s a bronson vigilante thriller where his motivation isn\\'t down to a blood feud but this leads to credibility becoming strained bronson is a retired hit-man who isn\\'t giving up his retirement for anything until someone shows him a video tape featuring interviews with the victims of \" the doctor \" , not the legendary time traveler but a infamous expert on torture . it\\'s never really explained why the doctor is so infamous since any police state has a myriad of these sadists nor is it explained why the doctor and his sister have ridiculous english accents as you may guess it\\'s a lazily written movie and incidents happening because the screenwriter needs things to happen to further the plot no matter how unlikely they are like one of the bad guys getting invited to a threesome so he can be killed or things being revealed like the doctor\\'s sister being a lesbian so some t&a can be included in many ways it\\'s like one of those nasty chuck norris vehicles that were being released at the same time , but the most disappointing thing is that the director is also the same man who made ice cold in alex and the guns of naverone two very well regarded war dramas that are often shown on sunday afternoons . believe me this movie won\\'t be shown until well after the watershed well, here\\'s another terrific example of awkward 70\\'s film-making! the rudimentary premise of \"what\\'s the matter with helen?\" is quite shocking and disturbing, but it\\'s presented in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion! in the hands of any other movie crew, this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale, but with director curtis harrington (\"whoever slew auntie roo?\") and scriptwriter henry farrell (\"hushâ…hushâ…sweet charlotte\") in charge, it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres. the basic plot of the film is definitely horrific, but there\\'s a lot more to experience, like love stories, a swinging 1930\\'s atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tap-dancing! the setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique. we\\'re literally catapulted back to the 1930\\'s, with a sublime depiction of that era\\'s music, religion, theatrical business and wardrobes. following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to life-imprisonment for murder, adelle (debbie reynolds) and helen (shelley winters) flee to california and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls. particularly adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment, as she falls in love with a local millionaire, but poor old helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia. she only listens to the ramblings of a radio-evangelist, fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies. the script, although not entirely without flaws, is well written and the film is adequately paced. there\\'s never a dull moment in \"what\\'s the matter with helen\", although the singing, tap-dancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot. but the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefices from the terrific acting performance of shelley winters. she\\'s downright scary as the unpredictable and introvert lady who\\'s about to snap any second and, especially during the last ten minutes or so, she looks more petrifying than all the freddy kruegers, jason voorhees\\' and michael myers\\' combined! there are several terrific supportive characters who are, sadly, a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential, like michã©al macliammã³ir as the cocky elocution teacher, agnes moorehead as the creepy priestess and timothy carey as the obtrusive visitor to the ladies\\' house. there are a couple of surprisingly gruesome scenes and moments of genuine shock to enjoy for the grand guignol fanatics among us, but particularly the set pieces and costume designs (even nominated for an oscar!) are breathtaking. resnais, wow! the genius who brought us hiroshima mon amour takes on the challenge of making a 1930s french musical in vibrant colour. the opening voice-over with old, embellished inter-titles was a nice touch. then the camera aperture opens (like the old hand crankers) on a black & white placard. the camera backs off (or rather, up), suddenly showing us the surprisingly brilliant colours of an elegant table set for a tea party. this is all in the first 60 seconds. then the music starts. a rather banal and forgettable diddy featuring an unconvincing chorus of 3 girls blabbering some nonsense which has no relevance to the film (and yes, i speak french, so i can\\'t blame it on the subtitles). those characters whiz out the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgettable song. then they leave, and finally audrey tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue 15 minutes into the film. i\\'m not sure what resnais intended by starting off with such a yawning waste of time & musical cacophony. but the effect on the viewer is to make you want to hurl skittles at the screen and storm out. i endured. it didn\\'t get much better. i\\'ll tell you why. there is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters. we don\\'t even see their faces half the time (as resnais seems too intent on showing off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera). people flit on & off stage like moths around a lamp, and we the audience are unable to focus on any particular person or plot. it\\'s as if you were to take every episode of the brady bunch and cram it into a 2 hour movie. with bad songs. the only thing that kept me watching as long as i did (1 hour) was that i was looking at the camera techniques, lighting and scenery which were all, i admit, excellent. but is that enough to hold your attention for 2 hours? not me. maybe tomorrow i\\'ll try watching the end. aw, who am i kidding. i have more important things to do. i\\'m sure you do, too. skip this. i saw this movie in the middle of the night, when i was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else on to watch. it\\'s one of those films where you stop to see what it is - just for a moment! - but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just can\\'t turn it off, no matter how bad it is. one of those movies that is somewhere in between being so bad it\\'s good and so bad it\\'s, well, just plain bad, it\\'s worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that it\\'s both! great middle-of-the-night fare, if only for the fabulous tennis drag. don\\'t even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that chad lowe is so obviously male, because logic does not apply. this movie takes the plot behind the sci-fi flick \"doppelganger\" (an astronaut from our earth crashing on a \\'counter-earth\\' on the opposite side of the sun, and the cold war totalitarian vibes on that world) and tries to turn it into a pilot for a tv series. however, the whole thing sank without a trace, and tv is probably better off for it. everyone here is perfectly adequate in a \\'made for tv\\' way. cameron mitchell turns in his usual solid performance. so does glenn corbett (who seems to be a kind of poor man\\'s john saxon) who plays the rugged individualist whose very existence poses a threat to the foundation of the \\'world order\\' on counter earth. but the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the lack of any real imagination in the set designs and cinematography keep this sci-fi adventure firmly tethered on the launch pad. i\\'ll give one example: in the original template for this pilot, (\"doppleganger\"), the astronauts lose control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm, and crash their ship in a truly appalling sequence (it was obvious that their ship was never going to fly again). then the two astronauts stagger helplessly from the smoking remains of their vehicle in the middle of howling rains and winds, only to be smacked down and overcome by faceless men yelling through loudspeakers. in \"stranded in space\", the astronauts are sitting in their seats when buzzers sound, things start shaking, and the camera blurs into a blackout (and as a friend pointed out, it was pretty obvious that the actors were simply shaking themselves on their seats, the director wasn\\'t even shaking the camera or the set). i\\'ve seen episodes of \"the twilight zone\" and \"the outer limits\" that took more effort to establish mood and setting than this made-for-tv mediocrity. and that, in essence, is what\\'s wrong with \"stranded in space\". no budget, no time, no imagination...just making the token gestures and hoping the sci-fi fan boys\\' imagination and enthusiasm will fill in the rest. sorry, guys, it didn\\'t work. i\\'m sure that everyone here just finished their work on this one and walked away, and never thought of it again, except as a listing on their c.v. and that\\'s what you, the viewer will do. you\\'ll remember, if pressed, that you once watched a tv movie called \"stranded in space\", but it made no lasting impression on you, and you can\\'t recall too much about it. black comedy isn\\'t always an easy sell. every now and then you get a black comedy that is hugely successful, like fargo, for example. but usually they don\\'t often find big audiences. people seem to either set their minds for comedy, or for serious mayhem. there doesn\\'t seem to be a big market for a good mixture of both. throw momma from the train was a fairly decent hit, yet few people seem to remember much about it in this day and age. danny devito just about hit this one all the way out of the park back in 1987. devito plays an odd mamma\\'s boy named owen looking to rid himself of his outrageously overbearing and unpleasant mother whom he still lives with. the mother is played by anne ramsey, who passed away shortly after this was released, and she is quite a caricature. she is loud, ugly, rude, and overbearing. though owen hardly seems like he could take care of himself, he wants desperately to have his mother offed. he fantasizes about it in some truly weird scenes, but he clearly doesn\\'t have the guts to actually do it himself. that\\'s where billy crystal comes in. crystal plays larry donner, owen\\'s creative writing teacher at a nearby community college. larry is a paranoid would-be intellectual novelist who claims his ex-wife stole his novel and made millions off it. he is currently trying to write a new one, but cannot even come up with a decent first sentence. \"the night was....\" owen hears larry wish his ex-wife were dead during an outburst at the school cafeteria. and borrowing the idea from strangers on a train, owen decides to travel to hawai\\'i and murder larry\\'s ex-wife. once it appears he has done so, he expects larry to return the favor and kill his mother. the resulting action is often quite funny, and even poignant. it\\'s certainly never dull and often full of surprises. the acting is exceptional, even if ramsey was a bit over the top. crystal is as good as he can be, and devito has always been undervalued as a performer. the film relies on quite a bit of physical comedy which usually works, often painfully so. the film makes use of some truly innovative editing techniques in some scenes, and the off-beat tone is truly refreshing. i have often been critical of the late 1980s as being a time of artistic malaise and down right lazy film-making. throw momma from the train takes chances. both in how its characters are drawn as well as its general plot. how many comedies revolve around a son having his mother murdered? the film isn\\'t too long, and it is chock full of laughs. writers are apt to find it more interesting than the general public, but it can still be enjoyed by just about anyone. 9 of 10 stars. the hound. back in 1994, i had a really lengthy vacation around the fourth of july - something like 17 days off in a row what with two weeks paid vacation, weekends and the holiday itself. i stayed in town during that time, hanging out at my parents\\' house a lot. i didn\\'t have a tv in my apartment so i used to watch my parents\\' tube. i had just finished watching a segment of the x files when a program came on called personal fx. i was hooked instantly. i had always been fascinated with items in our home that had come from my parents\\' family homes and through inheritances from relatives\\' estates, and often wondered about their history, value, etc. after my long vacation, i used to go to my folks\\' house on my lunch-hours just to catch personal fx. i can remember one episode during which co-host claire carter announced that the new york apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated and that once said renovations were complete that personl fx would return to the air. it never did! personal fx was the first -and best - of the collectible shows. and it vanished from the air! almost fifteen years later, i\\'m still sore. way to go, fx. paul verhoeven\\'s predecessor to his breakout hit \\'basic instinct\\' is a stylish and shocking neo-noir thriller. verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films, both in his native holland and in america and this film is one of the reasons why. the fourth man follows the strange story of gerard reve (played by jeroen krabbã©); a gay, alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes. while there, he meets the seductive christine halsslag (renã©e soutendijk) who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him, even if it kills him. paul verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film, and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it. many of the occurrences in the fourth man could be what they appear to be, but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration, and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on. paul verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself, and that is one of things i like best about him. this film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards (and that doesn\\'t happen very often!). i wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work...but you\\'ll see what i mean when you see the film (make sure you get the uncut version!). there is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one i\\'ve mentioned, but are lovely nonetheless; a man gets eaten by lions, another one has a pipe sent through his skull, a boat is smashed in half...lovely. the acting in the fourth man isn\\'t anything to write home about, but it\\'s solid throughout. jeroen krabbã© holds the audience\\'s attention and looks the part as the drunken writer. it is renã©e soutendijk that impresses the most, though, as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale. her performance is what sharon stone would imitate nine years later with basic instinct, but the original fatale did it best. paul verhoeven\\'s direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view, all of which help to create the mystery of the story. verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish, but he obviously has talent and it\\'s a shame that he doesn\\'t put it to better use. of all the verhoeven films i\\'ve seen, this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across; trust me, it\\'s worth the effort. i accept that most 50\\'s horror aren\\'t scary by today\\'s standards, but what the hell is this? when you see a title like this you expect to see blood and a blood thirsty beast. instead we get no blood at all and a beast who either wants to take over the world or live in peace on earth....yeah which is what the people wanted. the overall story is fine with the astronaut coming back to life and being one with the beast....but the title really kills the movie. night of the beast would have made the fans more happy because there really isn\\'t any blood to speak of. i like how the 50\\'s movies had endings that left room for a sequel but wisely never made one. this movie isn\\'t the worst i\\'ve ever seen but its almost up there. 2 out of 10 demon wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs. it is definitely an awful example of a film. so awful in fact that i don\\'t even consider it a movie. i describe it more as a thing ... a monstrous thing. a thing that must be stopped at all costs. my friends and i first discovered this ... thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friend\\'s house. it was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies (we unfortunately picked this one.) well, during the 90 minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up. the thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word. it\\'s just a cheap, poorly done rip-off of evil dead. the whole \"story\" seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demons rip them to pieces. i have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed. i\\'ve seen bad horror movies before (manos, troll 2, hobgoblins!!!) (shudder) i would have to say that demon wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity. watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid films. fun fact: this film is like a cockroach on steroids! much like the ouija board, every time we try to get rid of it, it always seems to mysteriously reappear. kind of scary huh? there is a difference between a \"film,\" and a \"movie.\" a film, regardless of quality, is ready for public consumption. a movie is what a group of friends gets together to make over the course of a weekend with a camcorder. in my time as a viewer, i have seen may examples of both. on september 19, i attended a screening of writer/director jon satejowski\\'s \"donnybrook.\" now having read the script and having seen two different cuts (a rough cut and the \"finished\" product) of this piece, i can safely say it is a movie. and a student movie, at that. it is, for lack of a better word, competent, which is to say, the director knew how to push record on a camera and capture moving images. the visuals are, for the most part, static and unimpressive, and dialog scenes are reduced to mostly long shots, with little to no close up shots to allow the audience to establish a relationship with the characters. i understand that this is a modestly budgeted film, but some visual flair would have been appreciated, and it would have gone a long way toward keeping the audience interested. granted, there have been independent pictures that have shown that limited camera work can be over come with well a well written, engrossing story and some sharp dialog. steven soderbergh\\'s \"sex, lies, and videotape\" comes immediately to mind. this movie, however, has neither. the main story is weak and unfocused. if the main plot is davie trying to mend his relationship with his father, then i feel this movie misses the point. what i got out of it is that davie\\'s main aspiration is to \"change the face of rock \\'n\\' roll.\" however, we see very little activity on his part to show this. while there is one dream sequence at the beginning, and an impromptu performance of his at the end, all we seem to get are scenes of davie listening to music or casually strumming a guitar. we are simply told that davie has played a lot of gigs, but we never see him in full rock out mode. next time, show don\\'t tell the audience. anyone who has taken a creative writing class knows this. also, davie doesn\\'t look like someone that would have been big in the glam rock era of the 1970\\'s; he looks like he\\'d be more comfortable in the early days of rock \\'n\\' roll, posing as james dean\\'s less talented brother. in the meantime, the rest of the movies events seem to happen at random to rather clichã© characters, and story threads, that have little or nothing to do with the slim main story, are brought up and abandoned with alarming frequency (i.e. the subplot involving terry\\'s father). if i want to see a film with this kind of haphazard construction, i will consider watching \"napolean dynamite\" again, a film i could barely make it through the first time. as for the above mentioned dialog scenes, i guess i should mention that they are few and extremely far between. is it too much to ask for characters who do speak? i don\\'t think it is. when the characters do speak, it is in short, choppy sentences; collections of oh so insightful questions, angered grunts or wildly over-the-top outbursts. these characters simply do not behave like normal, rational people. working with material like this, it is easy to understand why there is only one good performance in the film, al hudson\\'s, and that\\'s just because he\\'s doing a poor imitation of sam elliott for his time on screen. a good director, or at least one who is ready for the challenge of a feature director, would have been able to spot these problems and get the writer and camera people to correct them. however, with satejowski being so close to the material, he simply doesn\\'t see them, or, if he does, he is unwilling to take the necessary steps to fix them because it\\'ll hurt his creative vision. being unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in a constructive manner, is the mark of a self-indulgent, misguided fool. just ask rob schneider. in the end, we are left with a poor, high-school-set, knock-off of zach braff\\'s amazing \"garden state\" combined with the equally amazing \"velvet goldmine,\" two films far more worthy of your time. now before any of the cast or crew come out of the word work to take me to task for this review, allow me to offer this. the best i can do is compliment mr. satejowski for having the ambition to make a film of his own and to put it out there for an audience to see. however, the hopes that this movie will be picked up and distributed are simply deluded visions of grandeur. this is a student movie, nothing more, nothing less. if the movie holds any promise (and let\\'s face it, at this point, it isn\\'t going to come from the acting, writing, or directing), it is this: if, if, the people associated with this film are willing, then, please, learn from this movie, file it away, and use the lessons learned on your next attempt; don\\'t attack your critics, or have friend or family do it for you. if you are able to do this, maybe the next one will be worthy of distribution, worthy of being called a \"film.\" i am your audience, and i am willing to watch. please re-watch all 3 series and do not go see this movie, the trailer is completely misleading and the 3 weakest characters in the series stretch a badly thought out 25min tv episode into the most painful 2hrs of my life, truly an awful film. tubbs and edward are in it for a few mins, micky has 1 line, and her lipp just reels out the same tired old puns, also mr briss\\'s accent just changes about 5 times in the film tons of badly acted extras, and really a few laughs that they seem to recycle for 2 hrs i honestly feel this series has been completely ruined by this god-awful piece of crap..........batman and robin all is forgiven finally! an iranian film that is not made by majidi, kiarostami or the makhmalbafs. this is a non-documentary, an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girls subtly kicking the \\'system\\' in its ass. it\\'s all about football and its funny, its really funny. the director says \"the places are real, the event is real, and so are the characters and the extras. this is why i purposely chose not to use professional actors, as their presence would have introduced a notion of falseness.\" the non-actors will have you rooting for them straightaway unless a. your heart is made of stone b. you are blind. excellently scripted, the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness. it has won the jury grand prize, berlin, 2006. dear reader, it\\'s near-perfect. where, where can i get hold of it? sometimes you just have to have patients when watching indie horror. if you can just toe-tap your way through the slow-paced early scenes, sometimes a real gem will present itself... this (unfortunately) was not the case with \"satan\\'s whip\". written and directed by jason maran, \"satan\\'s whip\" attempts to drag us along on a boring snore-fest of a film, with no real pay off at the end. i\\'m guessing that the black & white (and blue) cinematography must have been for a reason, however it is never explained why the majority of the blood is blue, and i found this increasingly annoying as the film went on. the story in itself is not that bad, and actually had some originality and decent content but the acting is simply pathetic. this, combined with the slow-pacing and lack of any real (red) gore made \"satan\\'s whip\" one to forget quite quickly. i will give it a \"4\" rating for some witty dialog that made me chuckle, but alas that could not save this boring waste of my time. tainted look at kibbutz life this film is less a cultural story about a boy\\'s life in a kibbutz, but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general. in the first two minutes of the movie, the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves. and it\\'s all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical \"kibbutznikim.\" besides the two main characters, a clinically depressed woman and her young son, every one else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of wellâ…evil. the story centers on how the kibbutz, like some sort of cult, slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows. there is no happiness, no joy, no laughter in this kibbutz. every character/situation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny, hypocrisy, violence, cultism, repression etc. for example, while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome european looking 12 year old boy â– his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his \"jewish\" physical appearance and brutish personality. he cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother. he treats these volunteers like trash. after his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he hasn\\'t seen in a long time due to his military service, he orders, quote â– \"linda, go take shower and i cum in two minutes.\" there is one other \"good\" character in this movie â– a european foreigner who plays the mother\\'s boyfriend. when the animal rapist tries to hit the mother\\'s son, the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapist\\'s arm. he is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for \"violent\" behavior against one of the kibbutz members. more hypocrisy: the indescribably annoying french woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age 18, or without love and gives an account of the actual act that\\'s supposed to be humorous for the audience, but is really just stupid. she of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boy\\'s mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse. the film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult. children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders. the mother apparently can\\'t \"escape\" the kibbutz, although in reality, anyone was/is always free to come and go as they choose. it\\'s a mystery how the boy\\'s father died, but you can rest assured, the kibbutz \"drove him to it\" and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless, wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son. that\\'s the gist of this movie. one dimensional characters, over dramatization, dry performances, and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audience\\'s head â– that kibbutz life was degrading, miserable and even deadly for those who didn\\'t \"fit in.\" i feel sorry for the guy who made this film â– obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz. but i feel as though he took a few kernels of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs. (when will i ever learn-?) the ecstatic reviewer on npr made me think this turkey was another citizen kane. please allow me to vent my spleen... i will admit: the setting, presumably new york city, has never been so downright ugly and unappealing. i am reminded that the 70\\'s was a bad decade for men\\'s fashion and automobiles. and all the smoking-! if the plan was to cheapen the characters, it succeeded. for a film to work (at least, in my simple estimation), there has to be at least one sympathetic character. only ned beaty came close, and i could not wait for him to finish off nicky. if a stray shot had struck mikey, well, it may have elicited a shrug of indifference at the most. i can\\'t remember when i detested a film as strongly. i suppose i\\'m a rube who doesn\\'t dig \"art\" flicks. oh, well. \"lost\", \"24\", \"carnivale\", \"desperate housewifes\"...the list goes on and on. these, and a bunch of other high-quality, shows proves that we\\'re in the middle of a golden age in television history. \"lost\" is pure genius. incredible layers of personal, and psychologically viable, stories, underscored by sublime cinematography (incredible to use this word, when describing a tv-show), a killer score, great performances and editing. anyone who isn\\'t hooked on this, are missing one of the most important creative expressions in television ever. it may have its problems, when watching only one episode a week, but the dvd format is actually an incredible way to watch this. hope they keep it up (as i\\'m sure they do). clifton webb is one of my favorites. however, mister scoutmaster is not one of his best. his patented curmudgeon role seems forced and even unpleasant rather than funny. the film itself is overflowing with mawkish sentimentality. in addition, the viewer is presented with numerous ham-handed references to religious faith and u.s. patriotism that come off as over-reverent rather than genuine. clifton webb does his best with a poor script. edmund gwenn plays yet another jovial clergyman and is given nothing to do. the child actor lead is played by a talentless child who displays a flat affect throughout the entire film. his sole claim to fame as a performer evidently is a bullfrog-like low voice unusual for someone of his age. however, once you\\'ve heard it, you\\'ve heard it and you don\\'t need to hear it again. unfortunately, he is in the majority of the film\\'s scenes. i find this child so irritating that i fast forward whenever he shows up. since he has a lot of scenes in this film, this means that i fast forward through a lot of the film. there were and are so many talented child actors; it\\'s a pity this film doesn\\'t have any of them in it. still, clifton webb in the traditional broad-brimmed hat and shorts is a sight worth seeing. this is a must-see documentary movie for anyone who fears that modern youth has lost its taste for real-life adventure and its sense of morality. darius goes west is an amazing roller-coaster of a story. we live the lives of darius and the crew as they embark on the journey of a lifetime. darius has duchenne muscular dystrophy, a disease which affects all the muscles in his body. he is confined to a wheelchair, and needs round-the-clock attention. so how could this crew of young friends possibly manage to take him on a 6,000 mile round-trip to the west coast and back? watch the movie and experience the ups and downs of this great adventure - laugh and cry with the crew as they cope with unimaginable challenges along the way, and enjoy the final triumph when they arrive back three weeks later in their home town to a rapturous reception and some great surprises! the message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses; the mythical city of everytown in 1940 represents england in general, but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world. when war finally does arrive, it\\'s ravages continue not for another five years, but until 1966 at which time everytown is completely destroyed. adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the \"wandering sickness\", a pestilence that continues for another four years. \"things to come\" balances both a fatalistic and futuristic world view, where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization. the \"wings over the world\" concept plays out a bit corny, though it\\'s spokesman cabal (raymond massey) is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause. if he fails, others will follow. this message is continually reinforced throughout the film, brought home convincingly in massey\\'s end of movie speech. man\\'s insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an \"all the universe or nothing\" mindset. the film\\'s imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film \"metropolis\". as everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year 2036, the spectacle of the city\\'s rebirth strikes a resonant chord, as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie\\'s eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition. where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is man\\'s first mission to the moon, but in 1936, a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than 1969. \"things to come\" is one of those rarities in film, a picture that makes you think. which side will you come down on, the forces for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo? it\\'s not a comfortable question, as both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable outcomes. those who choose to be bystanders risk being swept away by forces beyond their control. fulci... does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movies ever made? answer: yes! cat in the brain, also known as nightmare concert is fulci\\'s last masterpiece. yes it is, no matter what some people will say about it. there are few facts why this movie is one of the best fulci\\'s movies. fulci make a fun of himself and his movies with this one. lead roll in this movie is no other then fulci himself, who plays... well horror-splatter-gore director, who thinks he is slowly going insane. it\\'s filled with black humor which unlike in the most of the modern horror movies works here. being fulci flick, you need to know it\\'s gory. how much? well pretty much. i always loved gore in the movies and i never get enough of it, but cat in the brain actually stopped my thirst for gore, and believe me, it\\'s a hard to archive. even the braindead didn\\'t stop it. citb is all about gore. almost every scene revolves about fulci, who after being hypnotized by *khmmm* evil psychiatrists is seeing all kinds of horrors for everything that happens to him or everything he sees. some of the scenes involves him accidentally dropping the whiskey, and instead of that he sees rotten corpse lying on the floor, which starts to spit some ooze from it\\'s wounds. forget the beyond or zombie 2, this is the goriest fulci movie! now i like how fulci manage to apply all those comic parts in the gorefest movie. he is such a brilliant director. some funny moments and lines happens from time to time, like one where fulci says \"making gore movies is kind of a sickness\" ending is very good considering that fulci (and most of the italian horror masters) is know for making ending with no sense or many plot holes. if you are fun of the fulci, make sure you check it out. if you have a weak stomach, avoid this and repeat \"its only a movie\" ps. some of the gore scenes within this movie: chainsaw dismemberment (full), tongue torn out, eyeballs torn out, maggot infested corpses, zombies, decapitations, face being putted in boiling water, stabs in the shower (to head), throat slit, many parts of the body and organs being toast aside, hammer smashed face... what an incomprehensible mess of a movie. something about a cop who extracts bullets from himself after he gets shot and keeps them in a glass jar in his bathroom (and from the size of the jar he\\'s been shot about fifty times by now) and a top secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who for some reason drive it into mexico. whether they were sent there intentionally or just got really really lost is never made clear. and you\\'ll never hear another screenplay feature the word \"butthorn\" either. gary busey tries out the mel gibson role from \"lethal weapon\" and while busey is a serviceable actor the screenplay damns the whole movie to mediocrity. william smith does another turn as a russian soldier, the same character he played in \"red dawn\" a few years earlier. after playing biker heavies for most of the 70s it was sort of nice to see him expand his range playing communist heavies. sadly he\\'ll probably always be remembered best as the guy who clint eastwood whupped in \"every which way you can.\" i love to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the raptors. i like raptors because they are scary. my favorite parts are the ones where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the friday the 13th movie with the girl who eats the banana. i really love to watch a lot of this movie because the computer graphics seem a little fake but it\\'s okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and i think it\\'s got a good ending even though i didn\\'t really understand what was going on on my first couple viewings i figured it out over time and that\\'s the important part. the other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you\\'re watching it the first time. this is best movie. warning: review contains mild spoilers a couple of years back i managed to see the first five films in this franchise, and was planning to do an overview of the whole elm st. series. however, just two years on and i find i can\\'t remember enough about them in order to do it â– i guess they couldn\\'t have made much of an impression. from what i do recall, some of the sequels â– dream warriors in particular â– weren\\'t as bad as is often made out, though even the original was no classic. generally, the predictability of the premise (if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams) doesn\\'t lend itself to narrative tension. but while i cannot recall much of the first five films, i do know they never plumbed the depths of freddy\\'s dead. an indication of how sick of freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the character\\'s demise. the fact that the movie\\'s conclusion is not even hidden, but in fact the entire purpose for the film\\'s being goes to illustrate how vacant, soulless and cynical this venture was. taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain, robert englund\\'s in-no-way-scary interpretation booms with laughter. i always thought freddy\\'s mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe. it\\'s like englund\\'s crying out \"we know this is garbage â– but you\\'re paying to see it, so who\\'s the one laughing?\" and i\\'m sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight. was freddy\\'s appearance in the films always so rudimentary? all he gets to do here is a few \"haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr â– har â– har â– hars\" and that\\'s it. if this was the only elm st. film you\\'d ever seen you wouldn\\'t get to know the character at all. even as the character pre-death in a flashback englund plays him as a boo-hiss pantomime villain with a slop of transatlantic (ie. overstated, misplaced and not at all funny) irony. acting is almost universally poor. just look at how many times breckin meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language. only kananga himself, yaphet kotto, keeps his dignity. and when roseanne, tom arnold and alice cooper show up, you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire. the script, too, is absolutely lousy, almost wholly without merit. carlos (ricky dean logan) opens a road map, upon which the noel coward-like freddy has wittily written \"you\\'re f**ked\". when prompted for the map, carlos responds \"well the map says we\\'re f**ked\". who wrote the screenplay, oscar wilde? or how about the scene where carlos is tortured by freddy, his hearing enhanced to painful levels? so freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin â– a potentially fatal sound, given that all sounds are magnified. oddly, the fact that carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect. \"nice hearing from you, carlos\", quips freddy, hoping some better lines will come along. it\\'s also worth noting that dream sleep doesn\\'t occur instaneously, so being knocked unconscious wouldn\\'t allow instant access into freddy\\'s world. though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a 3-d finale plot logic isn\\'t that high on the list of requirements. the teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious, dislikeable group in the whole series. tracy (lezlie deane) is the only one who gets to greet freddy with \"shut the f**k up, man\" and a kick in the scallops. and was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients? freddy\\'s dead. no laughs. no scares. no interest. no fun. some comments here on imdb have likened dog bite dog to the classic cat iii films of the 90s, but although it is undoubtedly brutal, violent and very downbeat, this film from pou-soi cheang isn\\'t really sleazy, lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison. however, it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch, particularly if gritty, hard-edged action is your thing. edison chen plays pang, a cambodian hit-man who travels to hong kong to assassinate the wife of a judge; sam lee is wai, the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down, whatever the cost. with wai closing in on his target, pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escapeâ—until he meets yue, a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abuse. a relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography, amazing sound design, a haunting score, and solid performances from chen and lee (as well as newcomer pei pei as pang\\'s love interest), dog bite dog is one for fans of hard-hitting asian hyper-violence (think along the lines of chan-wook park\\'s vengeance trilogy). stabbings, shootings, merciless beatings: all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director cheang. of course, this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved, and sure enough, pretty much everyone in this film dies (rather nasty deaths). unfortunately, there is a fine line between tragedy and (unintentional) comedy, and in its final moments, dog bite dog crosses it: in a laughably over-dramatic final scene, pang and wai are locked in battle as a pregnant yue looks on. eventually, after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas, a wounded pang performs a diy ceasarean on (a now dead) yue, delivering their baby moments before he himself dies. whilst this film might not be a \\'classic\\' slice of hong kong excess, with its deliriously ott action and stylish visuals, it\\'s still worth seeking out. i watched this movie for the hot guy--and even he sucked! he was the worst one--well, okay, i have to give props to that freaky police officer rapist guy too, he was even worse. the guy wasn\\'t that cute in the end, he had the most terrible accent, and he was the most definite definition of hicksville idiot that can\\'t stand up to his mom for the one he \"loves\" there\\'s ever been. overall, and if this makes any sense to you, when i go to pick up movies at the video store, i think to myself as i read the back of a movie that looks so/so, \"well, at least it can\\'t be worse than carolina moon.\" the most terrible movie, and the most terrible writing, acting, plot--everything in it made my gag reflexes want to do back flips. it was the most horrid movie i will ever see, with gabriela way up there too. i hated it, and trust me, if there was any number under 1 imdb had for rating, i\\'d choose that in a heartbeat. absolute must see documentary for anyone interested in getting to the bottom of this story. told with unflinching eye and with gripping style. if you think conspiracy theories are for paranoid disturbed people, this could change your mind. something for you feds too: a good model for government coverups! if you like your news all tidy and easy to consume this is not for you. i have decided to not believe what famous movie critics say. even though this movie did not get the best comments, this movie made my day. it got me thinking. what a false world this is. what do you do when your most loved ones deceive you. it\\'s said that no matter how often you feed milk to a snake, it can never be loyal and will bite when given a chance. same way some people are such that they are never grateful. this movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone is ultimately just thinking about oneself and working for oneself. a brother dies inadvertently at the hands of a gangster. the surviving brother decides to take revenge. through this process, we learn about the futility of this world. nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone. amitabh gave the performance of his life. the new actor aryan gave a good performance. the actress who played the wife of amitabh stole the show. her role was small but she portrayed her role so diligently that one is moved by her performance. chawla had really great face expressions but her role was very limited and was not given a chance to fully express herself. a great movie by raj kumar santoshi. his movies always give some message to the audience. his movies are like novels of nanak singh (a punjabi novelist who\\'s novels always had a purpose and targeted a social evil) because they have a real message for the audience. they are entertaining as well as lesson-giving. after a very scary, crude opening which gives you that creepy \"chainsaw massacre\"-feeling, everything falls apart. spoiler alert: as soon as the two fbi-officers start jabbing, you know they are the real killers. anyone who have seen enough of these \"fooled-ya\"-movies can figure this out. this movie is mader with one thing in mind: to depict brutal murders. why, then, is not the little girl tortured and murdered as well? will this be next for us movie-goers? the torture and abuse of children? whats wrong with you people? lynch is truly has a disgusting, ugly mind. i can\\'t say much about this film. i think it speaks for itself (as do the current ratings on here). i rented this about two years ago and i totally regretted it. i even /tried/ to like it by watching it twice, but i just couldn\\'t. i can safely say that i have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever, ever again. and i\\'m not one to trash a movie, but i truly believe this was awful. it wasn\\'t even funny in the slightest. the only bits i enjoyed were the few scenes with christopher walken in them. i think this film ruined both jack black and ben stiller for me. all i can think of when i see one of their films now-a-days is this terrible movie, and it reminds me not to waste my money. amy poehler is so very annoying, too. overall, well, i think you get my point. the stars are for walken, by the way. i am not so old that i can\\'t remember laughing at bobcat goldthwait a couple times. but some where in all his years of drug abuse he lost his sense of humor as well as his brain cells. from the moment this film opens you can have no sympathy nor empathy for the female lead. neither will you find anything remotely funny after hearing the opening line. goldthwait obviously hates himself so much that he needs to degrade in order to feel better- even if it is his own imaginary characters he degrades. if you ever saw shakes the clown you know how unfunny bobcat was 15 years ago...this movie is worse. it was not even funny by accident it is sad, pathetic and a total waste of time. may goldthwaits\\' hands be rendered paralyzed so he can not write another script. strike his tongue so he can not dictate another unfunny scene. he is sad and pathetic and needs to make room for a new talent dying to get into hollywood in new orleans, an illegal immigrant feels sick and leaves a poker game while winning the smalltime criminal blackie (walter jack palance). he is chased by blackie and his men raymond fitch (zero mostel) and poldi (guy thomajan), killed by blackie and his body is dumped in the sea. during the autopsy, the family man lieutenant commander dr. clinton reed (richard widmark) of the u.s. public health service finds that the dead man had pneumonic plague caused by rats and he needs to find who had any type of contact with the man within forty-eight hours to avoid an epidemic. the city mayor assigns the skeptical captain tom warren (paul douglas) to help dr. clint to find the killers that are infected with the plague and inoculate them. \"panic in the streets\" discloses a simple story, but it is still effective and with a great villain. the engaging plot has not become dated after fifty-seven years. jack palance performs a despicable scum in his debut, and the camera work while he tries to escape with zero mostel is still very impressive. my vote is seven. title (brazil): \"pã¢nico nas ruas\" (\"panic in the streets\") the box is why i originally picked up this movie and the back is why i rented it. but i soon learned that i had been duped. i had thought this movie would be something like a road trip/eurotrip/american pie deal. but i was wrong. this movie is one of the dumbest i\\'ve seen in a long time. the unrated version teases you in to watching but will completely disappoint you. the acting was terrible and sound effects just gaudy. it appeared very low budget with the entire setting taking place in the same building. go out and get eurotrip or road trip instead. i can\\'t believe national lampoon put its name on this. don\\'t buy it, don\\'t rent it. don\\'t waste 2 hours of your life on this. there have been many documentaries that i have seen in which it appeared that the law was on the wrong side of the fence - the thin blue line and paradise lost come to mind first and foremost. but this is the first film that had me seething with anger after i saw it. it seems blatantly clear to me from the evidence presented in this film that what happened at waco was at the very least an unprofessional and sloppy mess on the part of the fbi and afi, and at the very worst an act of murder. like most people, when the siege at waco was occurring i assumed that david koresh was a completely evil madman who was leading a violent cult. after seeing this, i think that koresh was more likely a slightly unbalanced and confused guy who inadvertently caught the attention of the u.s. government through his eccentric actions. sure, there were lots of weapons at the branch davidian compound. but none of it was illegal. it was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video footage of the people inside the compound, all of them seeming to be very nice and harmless. and it was angering to see the callous testimony of the men in charge of the government forces on the waco site, the clueless testimony of janet reno, and the partisan defense of the attack on waco, a defense led by a few of the committee democrats. standing out most in my mind was ny representative and current u.s. senator from ny charles schumer. i voted for the man when i lived in ny state - i\\'m a democrat, pretty left-leaning too. after seeing his actions on this committee, i wish i could go back in time and vote for d\\'amato instead! for anyone remotely interested in the government, this is a very crucial film, a must see. i even think this should be shown in classes - it\\'s that important. i saw this movie last night and thought it was decent. it has it\\'s moments i guess you would say. some of the scenes with the special ops forces were cool, and some of the location shots were very authentic. i won\\'t be putting this movie in my dvd collection but it is fair enough to recommend for renting. i guess nothing set the movie at another level compared to others of the same genre. the action is good, the acting is decent, the women are extremely seductive and exotic in my opinion, and the story is pretty interesting. 7 out of ten yes, i call this a perfect movie. not one boring second, a fantastic cast of mostly little known actresses and actors, a great array of characters who are all well defined and who all have understandable motives i could sympathize with, perfect lighting, crisp black and white photography, a fitting soundtrack, an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that is engaging and works. it\\'s one of those prime quality pictures on which all the pride of hollywood should rest, the mark everyone should endeavor to reach. barbara stanwyck is simply stunning. there was nothing this actress couldn\\'t do, and she always went easy on the melodramatic side. no hysterical outbursts with this lady - i always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like bette davis or joan crawford, and this movie confirmed my opinion. always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments. it is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career, and this one is by far the least interesting. the title fits this movie very well. it is about desires, human desires i think everyone can understand. actually, no one seems to be scheming in this movie, all characters act on impulse, everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else. the sad fact that this more often than not leads to complications makes for the dramatic content into which i will not go here. i liked what this movie has to say about youth, about maturing and about the necessity to compromise. the movie i associate most with this one is alfred hitchcock\\'s shadow of a doubt, it creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured small town america. the story has a certain similarity with fritz lang\\'s considerably harsher movie clash by night, made one year earlier, where stanywck stars in a similar part. i can also recommend it. i would like to know if anyone know how i can get a copy of the movie, \"that\\'s the way of the world\". it\\'s been about 30 years since i\\'ve seen this movie, and i would like to see it again. earth wind & fire transcend the nation globally with their inspirational music and themes. it was unfortunate that this group didn\\'t take off like their counterparts in the early 70\\'s, but as previously stated, racial tension existed in the united states which prohibited equalized exposure for the african american musical groups. it is good to see that earth wind & fire continuing their success. i would like to add this movie to my collection. someone please help me if possible. thank you for your attention. milton shaw i saw the movie \"hoot\" and then i immediately decided to comment it. the truth is that nature needs protection from us because we are the dominant specie of this planet. some people think that if they have money, they can do whatever they want to, which probably is like, but if they think about the future more then they think about themselves they would do something useful! this movie is not just about kids, this movie is showing us that the kids are usually the ones that care more about it then the adults do. when i was twelve, i saw some waterlilies and i knew they are protected by law and didn\\'t even dare to touch them not fearing of the law, but fearing that i might harm them actually. (i am currently 15) what so ever, the acting was great, the 3 main characters are well interpreted and we all have to learn from them. i hope you all think about what you saw in that movie!!! and enjoy! i had some reservations about this movie, i figured it would be the usual bill of fare --- a formula movie about christmas. being in the middle of a heat wave in late june, we decided to give it a shot anyway, maybe we would see some snow. this movie turned out to be one laugh after another. ben affleck was believable in his character, but the real star of this one is james gandofini. he delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great \"dad\". if you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours, definitely check this one out. when i first saw this film around 6 months ago, i considered it interesting, but little more. but it stuck with me. that interest grew and grew, and i wondered whether my initial boredom and response had more to do with the actual vhs quality rather than the film itself. i purchased the criterion dvd box set, and it turns out that i was right the second time. alexander nevsky is a great film. it is rousing, and i\\'m sure it succeeded in its main aim: propaganda against the germans. that is the most common criticism against this film, and against eisenstein, that it is merely propagandist and nothing else. it\\'s untrue. he is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived. by now, the world is far enough beyond joseph stalin to be able to watch eisenstein\\'s films as art. focus is another great movie starring william h. macy. i first discovered macy in fargo and i\\'ve seen a few of his films and he hasn\\'t yet deceived me. macy is the archetypal \"nice guy with something to hide\". in focus, he plays the role of lawrence newman, a loyal and hard-working stiff, who harbours his handicapped mother at home. the scene is set after world war ii, at the height of mccarthyism. newman is the head of human resources for a company which is basically, anti-semite. after he accidentally hires a woman of jewish descent, he is asked to buy a pair of glasses, to improve his failing eyesight. unbelievably, the simple act of buying glasses has great repercussions on his life and that of gertrude hart, his wife (played by a great laura dern). as the film unravels, newman will begin to see a whole different world, where being jewish is akin to being an animal. the movie is disturbing in the way it shows that being racist was something fairly normal. the chilling thought is that in some places, it probably still is. in \"brave new girl,\" holly comes from a small town in texas, sings \"the yellow rose of texas\" at a local competition, and gets admitted to a prestigious arts college in philadelphia. from there the movie grows into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. i loved this movie. it was full of great singing and acting and characters that kept it moving at a very nice pace. the acting was, of course, wonderful. virginia madsen and lindsey haun were outstanding, as well as nick roth the camera work was really done well and i was very pleased with the end (it seems a sequel could be in the making). kudos to the director and all others that participated on this production. quite a gem in the film archives. despite a totally misleading advertising campaign, this flick turns out to be an irritatingly clichã©d, sub-par haunted house flick with a totally implausible ending. clue #1 for all considering seeing this turkey: sam raimi didn\\'t direct it. although commercials for the movie play up his involvement, in truth he is one of four producers. it\\'s too bad that someone as talented as raimi has allowed his name to be used in conjunction with such a poor movie. i don\\'t think he would ever have directed something like this; that task was left to the pang brothers. the screenplay for this film seems to have been cobbled together from numerous other \"horror\" films, so you\\'ll find absolutely zero original content in \"the messengers.\" what we get are a scene here and there that was plucked straight out of \"pulse,\" a couple that could have come from \"the birds,\" one or two from \"the others,\" etc. nearly every scene, almost every line of dialogue, is one that has been lifted from any number of other movies. the whole thing makes for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to figure out the \"surprise ending\" long before it comes. right about here would be a good time to point out that the advertising campaign, centered on the idea that only children can see ghosts, has nothing to do with this movie. in fact, everyone can see the ghosts. the teenage daughter and mother characters certainly see them, even quite early in the movie. i\\'m sure that whomever was in charge of marketing came up with this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have any box office appeal, which otherwise is entirely absent. now you know, so don\\'t be fooled! perhaps what this movie lacks most of all is anything resembling chemistry between the actors. it simply isn\\'t there. all of the interactions come across as awkwardly stilted. coupled with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot holes (just what is a guy who murdered his whole family doing still lurking around the small town where the murder happened, anyhow? didn\\'t anyone think to maybe arrest him?), it all adds up to a profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manages to surprise anyone over the age of ten with cheap shots: loud noises, visual flashes, and anything short of a sheeted figure jumping out of a closet and yelling \"boo!\" all we get for our buck this time around is yet another poorly-made film about spirits attempting to warn people away from a house. if there\\'s any message that \"the messengers\" delivers, it\\'s \"don\\'t waste your time on this movie.\" this movie sucks ass. something about a heatwave in some european country, complete trash. there\\'s nothing going for this movie whatsoever. maybe 30 seconds of sex but that\\'s it. there is a very annoying chick who hitches rides with people and really pisses me off. this movie is complete rash and you shouldn\\'t subject yourself to watching it. i regret it it\\'s very boring. i would rate it zero but i can\\'t. no body in their right mind should see this. i\\'m sure you\\'ll regret it completely i did. how could they think up something this bad. even mystery men was better. mystery men. that sucks. that movie wasn\\'t worth being made. complete waste of time. the characters in this are very hard to understand and i good very very very bored. i was looking forward to the guardian, but when i walked into the theater i wasn\\'t really in the mood for it at that particular time. it\\'s kind of like the olive garden - i like it, but i have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it. i\\'m not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit. the trailers looked good, but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last kevin costner movie that dealt with the subject - waterworld. plus, despite the promise ashton kutcher showed in the butterfly effect, i\\'m still not completely sold on him. something about the guy just annoys me. probably has to do with his simian features. it took approximately two minutes for my fears to subside and for my hesitancies to slip away. the movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission, and i was gripped tighter than kenny rogers\\' orange face lift. my concerns briefly bristled at kutcher\\'s initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious. sunglasses, a tough guy toothpick in his mouth, and sportin\\' a smirk that\\'d make george clooney proud? yeah, we get it. i was totally ready to hate him. but then he had to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jabs. darn you, ape man! efficiently mixing tense, exciting rescue scenes, drama, humor, and solid acting, the guardian is easily a film that i dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy. you can quibble about its clichã©s, predictability, and rare moments of overcooked sappiness, but none of that takes away from the entertainment value. i had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when costner started training the young guys, but on the contrary, the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film. coast guard rescue swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen, so i feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and a great way to introduce audiences to this under-appreciated group. do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer? just think about it -you get to go on dangerous missions in cold, dark, rough water, and then you must fight disorientation, exhaustion, hypothermia, and a lack of oxygen all while trying to help stranded, panicked people who are depending on you for their survival. and if all that isn\\'t bad enough, sometimes you can\\'t save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who lives and who dies. man, who wants all that responsibility? not me! i had no idea what it was really like for these guys, and who would have thought i\\'d have an ashton kutcher/kevin costner movie to thank for the education? not only does the guardian do a great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero, but lucky for us it also does a good job of entertaining its paying customers. the gist moviegoers wanting an inside look at what it\\'s like to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give the guardian a chance. i saw it for free, but had i paid i would\\'ve felt i had gotten my money\\'s worth. going into see seven pounds i wasn\\'t clearly sure what to think because the previews left to much open to grasp what the movie was really about. so within the first 20 min or so you are completely lost in the plot, have no idea what is going on and you think tim, who claims to be ben, is just a big asshole. all of this comes to an end when the \"twist\",so to speak, is unraveled at the very last minute of the movie. basically tim (will smith) was troubled and haunted by a big accident he made causing the end of seven peoples lives. by this he decides to scope out seven new people who are in need of help badly who he in turns gives his life to. the acting of this film is great, as i feel will smith no matter what part he seems to impress. rosario dawson, to me, this is one of her better movies, aside from eagle eye which i think is up there to. she has been in some bad some good but she does deliver in this film. other actors, such as woody harrelson, have very small roles and not a big enough role to grasp the character. although the casting of the film was still good. this movie was definitely not what i expected and certainly a lot slower pace in which i hoped. the movie, however, was still pretty good. nothing is revealed until the last 5 min of the movie and everything falls into place. up until then it just seems like a pointless love story. final thought seven pounds=seven stars. i saw brother\\'s shadow at the tribeca film festival and loved it! judd hirsch and scott cohen are great as father and son. the film follows scott cohen from parole in alaska back to his family in brooklyn. he shows up there because his brother has died, and he embarks on a journey to slowly repair his estranged relationships with his brother\\'s wife and child and his father who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family. the story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the complexity of their lives. also, the imagery of the woodworking business and the brooklyn backdrop sets the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait. \"mararã\\xada\" really disappointed me. i can\\'t consider it as a bad movie, but the development just seemed too rushed and non-believable for it to evoke any emotions. dr. fermã\\xadn displays some unprecedented bizarre behaviour out of a passion that one can\\'t really understand where it was born from. i mean, how many times does he ever have a conversation with mararã\\xada?? maybe once? also, mararã\\xada never appeared to be a real character, instead more like a film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie (...or else another title was needed?). some of the best acting came from a role that wasn\\'t really important to the story, that of marcial, the sub-intelligent yet humble drunkard. of course, the scenery, the cultural tidbits of the canary islands, and other \"wow\" moments were interesting, but the movie fell short of a documentary (in case this was its real intention), and most importantly, as a solid drama. serum is about a crazy doctor that finds a serum that is supposed to cure all diseases through the power of the mind. instead it creates some kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brains. the mad doc creates some zombies out of cadavers and has some problems. there is a very long lead into all the action with many scenes getting you acquainted with the characters. the mad doctor\\'s nephew gets into a car accident and the mad doc tries to use his new serum on the boy. the results are not good. this is a class c film with ok acting but some troubles directing and some continuity errors. there isn\\'t much zombie action in this one and the effects, while adequate, are nothing special. you can fast forward through the slow parts and get some enjoyment out of the action scenes. watch out for some nudity and bad language. witty. funny. intelligent. awesome. i was flipping channels late one night years ago. came across this and a wildfire started. i was staying up late every night and taping it for everyone i know. a few. like 3 people out of the almost 100 people i made watch this didn\\'t think it was as awesome as i did. the others were laughing out loud so hard they were crying and thanking me at the same time. please do yourself a favor. run don\\'t walk. watch this and enjoy. intelligence and humor. it\\'s a win-win situation. i wish i could have afternoon tea with him and meet the truly rare comedian that we as a society need more of....sanechaos. it\\'s a unique film, as it gives us our only chance to see the young noel coward in all his ironic glory. because he seems so reserved & detached he\\'s perfect for the role of an unloved cad who matter-of-factly uses all those around him. however in the deadly serious (no pun intended) last act, when coward must make like the flying dutchman, he\\'s much less comfortable. but his way with an epigram is peerless, and hecht & macarthur have given him some gems (macarthur, really -- he was the wit of the pair). the film is superbly lighted by the great lee garmes, but has little camera movement aside from a storm sequence. hecht and macarthutr cared about one thing -- getting their dialogue on screen. (note: h&m themselves have blink-and-you\\'ll-miss-\\'em cameos as bums in the flophouse scene). the most notable supporting player is the one and only alexander woolcott, notorious broadway columnist and close friend of both macarthur and coward, who appears as one of the bitchy authors always kept waiting in the reception room of publisher coward. curious that woolcott would agree to do a film that clearly lampoons the legendary algonquin round table, of which he was a founder, and macarthur something of an auxiliary member. the scoundrel actually won an oscar for best story, though that victory is probably due more to coward\\'s imposing presence than any brilliance in the plot. it\\'s coward, woolcott, and the dialogue you remember... this is definitely a \"must see\" film. the excellent director alain chabat (also acting as ceasar) has managed to capture the very essence of the \"adventures of astã©rix\" (the french comic books it\\'s based upon) and to create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy, which is also an homage to the world of animated films. this movie is so funny, so full of jokes (both visual and spoken) that it might take you two or three screenings before you notice them all, between your bursts of laughter. the only drawback is that a non-french audience (or at least a non-french speaking audience) might not get all the \"private jokes\". there are so many dialogues impossible to translate, so many situations directly related either to the comic books or to the french way of life, that the fun might be lessened. however, it\\'s still totally worth seeing for the beautiful picture, the amazing stunts, the music, the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting. all actors are great, but the film would not be the same without jamel debouze, gã©rard darmon and edouard baer. and please don\\'t ever compare this magnificent film to the terrible previous one based on the same comic books : \"astã©rix et obã©lix contre cã©sar\" and directed by claude zidi. i thought this movie was stunning, with completely outstanding performances by valentina cervi (artemisia gentileschi). cervi portrays artemisia so beautifully, with tentative yet confidant mannerisms, her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place. the passion to which artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to watch. although not each character was overtly beautiful, this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in time. overall i thought this film was fantastic. i consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling \"gentleman jim\" the best boxing movie ever made. that is the robert wise/paul newman flick \"somebody up there likes me.\" that movie might be number 1, but \"gentleman jim\" is a close number 2. the movie doesn\\'t just chronicle the rise of james j. corbett, it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition. in the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare-knuckle rules to the more \"gentlemanly\" days of the gloved, marquis of queensbury rules. and the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability. \"gentleman jim\" is not a realistic look at those days. it is romanticized and, yes, even a bit hokey at times. but always delightfully so. errol flynn is perfect as the \"gentleman\" jim who really isn\\'t a \"gentleman\" at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family. alexis smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has a love/hate relationship (and we all know it is, of course, love that will win that match in the end). at the end of \"gentleman jim\" the great john l sullivan (whose famous line was not \"i can lick any man in the world\" of course...romanticism again) hands over his belt to corbett. this is truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made. realistic? no. but wonderful. hey, if you want realism watch \"raging bull\" instead. that is a much more realistic boxing movie. but \"gentleman jim\" is a lot more fun. that this movie has been stapled to the wall of a chapel as proof that god is truly dead. am i the only one that really saw (rather sleptwalked) through this \"film\"? this is the only movie i\\'ve ever seen in the theater that i regret not walking out on and demanding my money back -- it was just that dull. and i even saw \"highlander 2: the quickening\" at the local cinema. from beginning to end, gibson and downey have absolutely no chemistry as two unlikelies, cast together by circumstance, who eventually work together as best buddies. the action (what little there is) is goofy and as dull as the skullbone of the writer. thank whatever deity is chortling down at us as it observes our \"cinema\" that there\\'s no chance for an \"air america 2.\" well, there\\'s no real plot to speak of, it\\'s just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and gratuitous sex (which can sometimes be fun, too, but it\\'s not in this case). what else can i say about this...? the action, when happening, is inventive and there\\'s a cool scene where two characters are falling from a skyscraper (one that has to be several miles high), but overall there\\'s not much to recommend \"kite\". watch it if you want, but you\\'re not missing much if you skip this one... this is the best film the derek couple has ever made and if you think this is a recommendation then you haven\\'t seen any of the others. there are the usual ingredients: it is just as poorly acted as their other efforts, we can watch bo disrobing or auditioning for wet t-shirt contests quite frequently, the story is just laughably idiotic, and the film takes itself much too seriously. and then: orang utans in africa? but it has a few things going for it. bo looks great, the production values (sets, costumes, etc.) are quite good, and this greatly enhances its camp value. in a strange way it is actually quite funny, simply because it tries to be serious and fails so badly. some people drift through life, moving from one thing or one person to the next without batting an eye; others latch on to a cause, another person or a principle and remain adamant, committed to whatever it is-- and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it. but we\\'re all different, `made of different clay,\\' as one of the characters in this film puts it, which is what makes life so interesting. some people are just plain crazy, though-- and maybe that\\'s the way you have to be to live among the masses. who knows? who knows what it takes to make things-- life-- work? writer/director lisa krueger takes a shot at it, using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed-- and how one `gets\\' committed-- and obsession, in `committed,\\' starring heather graham as a young woman who is adamant, committed, obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy, too. her name is joline, and this is her story. admittedly, joline has always been a committed person; in work, relationships, in life in general. she\\'s a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what. and when she marries carl (luke wilson), it\\'s forever. the only problem is, someone forgot to tell carl-- and 597 days into the marriage, he\\'s gone; off to `find\\' himself and figure it all out. when joline realizes he\\'s not coming back, she refuses to give up on him, or their marriage. maybe it\\'s because of that `clay\\' she\\'s made of. regardless, she leaves their home in new york city and sets off to find him, which she does-- in el paso, texas, of all places. but once she knows where he is, she keeps her distance, giving him his `space\\' and not even letting him know she\\'s there. she considers carl as being in a `spiritual coma,\\' and it\\'s her job to keep a `spiritual vigil\\' over him until he comes to his senses. and while she watches and waits, her life is anything but dull, as she encounters a young woman named carmen (patricia velazquez), a waitress at one of the local eateries; carmen\\'s `grampy,\\' (alfonso arau), who is something of a mystic; t-bo (mark ruffalo), a truck driver who has issues concerning carl; and neil (goran visnjic) an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her. for joline, it\\'s a journey of discovery, during which she learns a lot about carl, but even more about herself. there\\'s a touch of humor, a touch of romance, and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot. and krueger presents it all extremely well, delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining. her characters are very real people, with all the wants, needs and imperfections that make up the human condition; a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story. we see it from joline\\'s point-of-view, as krueger makes us privy to joline\\'s thoughts and therefore her motivations, which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold. that, along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates, makes for a very effective piece of storytelling. there\\'s an underlying seriousness to this subject matter, but krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy-handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that joline encounters. and the result is a well textured, affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life. heather graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make joline a character totally of her own creation. she immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable, adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person, and one that is real. and for this film to work, it was imperative that joline be viable and believable-- and graham succeeds on all fronts. her screen presence has never been more alluring, and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes, is enough to draw you in entirely. it\\'s all a part of the character she creates; there\\'s an appeal to joline that exudes from her entire countenance, who she is inside and out. she\\'s a likable, agreeable person, and because you\\'ve shared her innermost thoughts, you know who she is. it\\'s a good job all the way around, beginning with the way the character was written, to the way graham brings her so vibrantly to life. as carmen, patricia velazquez is totally engaging, as well. her performance is very natural and straightforward, and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character. she has a charismatic presence, but is less than flamboyant, and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down-to-earth. she is refreshingly open and up-front; you get the impression that carmen is not one to hold anything back, but is totally honest on all fronts, and that, too, is part of her appeal. and, as with joline, this character is well written, and velazquez brings her convincingly to life. overall, there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film, including those of luke wilson, casey affleck (as joline\\'s brother, jay), goran visnjic, alfonso arau and especially mark ruffalo as t-bo, who, with very little actual screen time, manages to create a memorable character. the supporting cast includes kim dickens (jenny), clea du vall (mimi), summer phoenix (meg), art alexakis (new york car thief), dylan baker (carl\\'s editor), and mary kay place (psychiatrist). a film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider the big picture-- reflecting upon who we are, where we\\'re going and what we really need-- `committed\\' is an enjoyable experience; a ride definitely worth taking. 8/10. ho-hum. an inventor\\'s(horst buchholz)deadly biological weapon is in danger of falling into the wrong hands. unknowingly his son(luke perry)has been working on the antedote all along. enter cia agent olivia d\\'abo and the cat-and-mouse car chases and gunfire begins. also in the cast are:tom conti, hendrick haese and an aging roger moore. moore seems to haggardly move through this mess definitely not one of his better efforts. perry fans will be accepting. d\\'abo is wrong for the role, but nice to look at. note to self. never ever ever again watch a serious movie with charlie sheen in it. great comedian, horrible seal. this movie makes navy seals look like a reckless group of rangers when, in fact, they are the most elite form of military in the world. charlie sheen helps destroy the navy seal reputation. thank you for making such an incredibly select group of individuals look awful in one of the worst action movies i have ever seen. this is a great story which could be made into an amazing action movie, but why charlie sheen? there are possibilities for a very passionate story here, but sheen decides to wreck them with \"funny\" comments. this movie is stupid. there\\'s no getting around it. but so is dumb and dumber. mind you, dumb and dumber is significantly more funny than this. however, i for one love seeing stupid movies (tail sting) and laughing with a group of good friends over how bad it is. call me callous, but see this movie, and you\\'ll find that the only way you can laugh at it is if you laugh at it instead of with it. i was looking forward to this so much, being a big fan of the book. however, when it came out i remember thinking it was one of the biggest wastes of money and time i\\'ve ever spent at the cinema. in principle, the acting, the sets and the music were excellent, and are the main reason why i\\'m rating this a 4. in this version, sara is a little too self-sacrificing for my taste. there is no way she would have deliberately lied to miss minchin just to stop her punishing the other girls; in the book she makes a point of describing lies as \"not just wicked, but vulgar.\" there\\'s also far too much of a disneyfied ending for me; sara\\'s father coming back from the dead and all of them trotting off into the indian sunset. while the book does have a happy (and critics might say equally improbable) ending, it doesn\\'t leave you thinking, \"oh puh-leeze.\" about the only things true to the book were: 1. sara\\'s father being a soldier 2. the lines between sara and her father (\"are you learning me by heart?\"/\"no. i know you by heart. you are inside my heart.\") 3. sara\\'s friendship with becky, and her \\'adopting\\' lottie (although this last one wasn\\'t developed as much as it could have been) 4. the changing of her room by adding various luxury items. that part was brilliantly done. 5. the basic core - a rich girl being flung into poverty suddenly - is there, but that\\'s about all that is. people might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience. possibly. all i can say to that is i have two cousins - aged 7 and 12 respectively - who were big fans of this film until they read the book. if all you want is a \\'feel-good\\' family film, then this delivers. if you\\'re looking for a film that actually tells the story of a little princess (in fact, if you\\'ve read the book) don\\'t waste time with this one. it\\'s such a shame; with a cast like this, if they\\'d stuck to at least the basic story it could have been fantastic. am i harping on about \\'read the book\\' this and \\'read the book\\' that a little too much? very probably. but if someone attempts to adapt a book - especially such a classic - into a movie, then they should at least have done the same thing. preferably more than once. as always this is an inaccurate picture of the homeless. tv told a lot of lies about panhandlers in the early 1990s and made everyone look bad, and claimed we all made over $100 a day when $20-40 a day was much closer to reality. when someone drove by where i held up a sign offering to work, and offered me work, i actually went and took the work if i was physically able.and if i would been offered the $100,000 id damned sure invested in in apt prepaid for at least 2 years, and kept most in the bank and still left myself $10-20000 for nl $1-2 and $2-5 cash games at the casinos. i usually always win and could win decent if i just had a bankroll. instead i win about $1000 a month is all playing in always minimum buying in due to not wanting to risk losing it all. i was only homeless cause i didn\\'t wanna risk spending all my money and going broke, sometimes i had over $1000-2000 in my sock while i slept outside. anyone wanting to talk contact sevencard2003 on yahoo messenger.i admit i was different than most homeless people though, due to the fact i never drank smoke or took drugs. im no longer homeless, am now in govt housing for $177 a month and getting ssi and spend most of my time winning at online poker. mom and sunflower diversified worked hard to get me ssi. glad my days of hiding in under the stage in the convention center of the casino at night sleeping, worrying about getting caught by security are finally over. had this tv crew picked me theyd been over a lot sooner. its a shame how they don\\'t better select who they pick. i really in enjoyed watching this movie. like most of the people that watched it. i wasn\\'t sure that i was getting. whoopi goldberg is a very funny comedian and she has done a lot of funny movies; i.e. sister act. however this was not really comedy. it is a drama with comedic moments. so if your looking for a laugh riot then keep looking. this movie is about a black family moving up from a nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood. i would say more but it think it would spoil the movie. this movie does not just deal with race relations between whites and blacks, but also about relations with in the black community. i do think that it is worth a chance. if your not really interested in see another movie about race relations then this movie isn\\'t for you having been a marine, i can tell you that the d.i. is as accurate a portrayal to date depicting marine corp boot camp and how boys are turned into men. jack webb is excellent as sgt.jim moore, a tough, but fair drill instructor in paris island north carolina. the film centers on one recruit who doesn\\'t seem to \"get with the program.\" a more recent film, full metal jacket, also shows life in basic training and is well worth viewing. every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie. this movie is the true example of how a psychological horror movie should be. the plot seems to be a bit confusing at first viewing but it will definitely explain a bit about what\\'s going on and you really want to view it for the second time. but after second viewing you will start to join the pieces together and then you will know how amazing a movie can be. a word of advice for slasher flick fans stay away from this movie. this is not your dumb ass teenage slasher movie, in which you just switch off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big b**bs and lots of blood. if you want to heighten the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that supports dolby digital or dts 5.1ch, without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on a really tense situation. and don\\'t forget to switch the light off. my points on different aspects:- direction = 9/10 acting = 8/10 atmosphere = 10/10 sound effect = 9/10 total = 9/10 ken burns\\' \"baseball\" is a decent documentary... it presents a clear origin of the game, a great depiction of baseball\\'s early years and heroes. there\\'s plenty in this movie for any baseball fan... that said, the film has several glaring flaws. 18 hours is simply too long for the human attention span. it\\'s clear that burns stretched his film out to fit his \"nine inning\" concept. it\\'s not even a tight 18 hours... the pace on every segment is slow, almost morose... the music always nostalgic and wistful. isn\\'t baseball ever exciting and fun? why is every player and their accomplishments presented in the form of a tragedy? talking head after talking head turn every pitch into an emotional heartbreak, yakking about baseball as a metaphor, baseball as americana, the psychology and theology of baseball... enough! this is syrupy, mawkish drivel. billy crystal is here to sell us all the yankee hokum he\\'s sold us before. ken burns uses the national anthem as the series\\' theme song, and manages to play \"take me out to the ballgame\" so many times you might vomit. we get it, dude. clearly burns is a neo-hollywood faux-liberal, so he spends probably a third of the film on the negro leagues... these segments are spent chastising whites of yesterday for not being as open-minded as kenny is today. for shame! he chides baseball for being segregated in the thirties and forties but fails to realize that america was segregated in those times! burns falls head over heels in love with buck o\\'neil, a former negro-league player, and drools over every piece of footage in which the elderly o\\'neil waxes poetic about his playing days. nonsense... burns would have been better off with an adult to help him edit his creation down. \"baseball\" winds up as mushy, gushy, civil-rights propaganda disguised as americana. its clear that burns is not a baseball fan... otherwise he would know we watch games laughing and cheering, not weeping and reciting soliloquies... are you listening, mr. burns? there\\'s no crying in baseball. \"quitting\" may be as much about exiting a pre-ordained identity as about drug withdrawal. as a rural guy coming to beijing, class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far surpass his peasant parents\\' acting success. troubles arise, however, when the new man is too new, when it demands too big a departure from family, history, nature, and personal identity. the ensuing splits, and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other. hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grim. but what an exceptionally convincing particularity, honesty, and sensuousness director zhang yang, and his actors, bring to this journey. no clichã©s, no stereotypes, no rigid gender roles, no requisite sex, romance or violence scenes, no requisite street language and, to boot, no assumed money to float character acts and whims. hongshen jia is in his mid-twenties. he\\'s a talented actor, impressionable, vain, idealistic, and perhaps emotionally starved. the perfect recipe for his enablers. soon he\\'s the \"cool\" actor, idolized by youth. \"he was hot in the early nineties.\" \"he always had to be the most fashionable.\" he needs extremes, and goes in for heavy metal, adopts earrings and a scarf. his acting means the arts, friends--and roles, but not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input. and his self-criticism, dulled by the immediacy of success, opens the doors to an irrational self-doubt, self-hatred-- \"i didn\\'t know how to act\" \"i felt like a phony\"--and to readily available drugs to counter them. he says \"i had to get high to do what director wanted.\" so, his shallow identity as an actor becomes, via drugs, an escape from identity. hongshen\\'s disengagement from drugs and his false life is very gradual, intermittent--and doggedly his own. solitude, space, meditative thinking, speech refusal, replace therapy. the abstract is out. and a great deal of his change occurs outdoors---not in idealized locations but mainly on green patches under the freeways, bridges, and high-rises of beijing. the physicality is almost romantic, but is not. the bike rides to ritan park, the long spontaneous walks, the drenching sun and rain, grassy picnics, the sky patterns and kites that absorb his musing are very specific. he drifts in order to arrive, all the while picking up cues to a more real and realistic identity. \"i started to open up\" he says of this period in retrospect. and the contact seems to start with his lanky body which projects a kind of dancer\\'s positioning (clumsy, graceful, humorous, telling) in a current circumstance. if mind or spirit is lacking, his legs can compel him to walk all night. central to his comeback is the rejection of set roles. to punctuate his end to acting and his determination to a new identity, he smashes his videos and tv, and bangs his head till bloody against his \"john lennon forever\" poster. he has let down his iconic anti-establishment artist---but he\\'s the only viable guide he knows. he even imagines himself as john\\'s son (yoko ono), and adopts his \"mother mary\" as an intercessor in his \"hour of darkness\" and \"time of trouble.\" (the wrenching, shaking pain in the park--hallucinatory and skitzoid ordeals) \"music is so much more real than acting\" he says. and speaks of lennon\\'s influence as \"showing me a new way.\" in the mental institute, the life-saving apples (resistance, nourishment) reflect lennon\\'s presence, as does hongshen\\'s need to re-hang his hero\\'s poster in his redecorated room. if lennon\\'s influence is spiriting, hongshen\\'s father\\'s influence is grounding. although father and son are both actors and users (drugs and drink), it is fegsen\\'s differences from his son that underwrites his change. for the father is more secure in himself: he accepts that he\\'s chinese, a peasant in a line of peasants, a rural theater director. and he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions. it\\'s this recognizable identity that drives hongshen to treat him like a sounding board, sometimes with anger and rage, sometimes with humor (the blue jeans, beatles) and passivity. in his most crazed, and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar, and a fake, he exposes more of himself than his father: \"all the acts i acted before were bullshit... life is bullshit.\" and to hongshen\\'s emphatic \"you are not my father,\" he softly replies, \"why can\\'t a peasant be your father?\" under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother, sister, friends, inmates at the rehab inst., he makes some tangible connection to a real (not whole) self. as the long term drug effects recede, so does his old identity. indebtedness replaces pride, trust distrust. integrity banishes his black cloud. all his edges soften. \"you are just a human being\" he repeats endlessly after being released from the strap-down incurred for refusing medicine. back home, lard peasant soap is fine with him now. and his once \"rare and true friendships\" begin again as is so evident in the back to poignant back-to-back fence scene with his musician buddy. hongshen says of this movie: \"it\\'s a good chance to think about my life.\" and i might add, become a new actor, one bound to art and life. like lennon, he has gained success without a loss of identity. i have watched this movie countless times, and never failed to be charmed by it\\'s homely simplicity, sincerity and goodness. great characterizations by all of the cast, and the lovely little steam trains that play a such an important supporting role.i confess i fell in love with roberta in 1970, and she still touches me today. shown on tv in new zealand on christmas day, the nicest present i could have had. if only i had read the review by alex sander (sic) on here rather than looking at the rating of over 6 from a select choice of the ignorant viewing public i would not have seen this desecration. alien was a fantastic, dramatic and well made horror/sci-fi. predator was a great sci-fi/action mess-about. i do really have only myself to blame though as i saw \\'alien versus predator\\'. it too has an average grading of over 6 stars from the connoisseurs of film that frequent this site. stop reading now if you have any fear of this ever so suspense ridden plot being ruined for you. right from the beginning this film was ridiculous. no explanation was offered for the predator ship overrun/not overrun by aliens. ok so maybe they were again going to throw aliens down to earth to hunt them and something went wrong but how did this result in an alien/predator hybrid and why did the rest of the crew not realise sooner despite their great technology? the start was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film because we had some idea of who was who or what was what and perhaps why. from then on it gets really ridiculous. i always leave my disbelief strictly suspended above the door of the screen before entering and collect it on the way out. i couldn\\'t here. a father and son are hunting in the woods. the damaged ship crash lands to (from the view given) i would calculate at the very least 10 odd miles away through thick woodland. the man and boy track there alone and find the ship and get face hugged. even at this point you feel very little for them mainly because the face huggers are almost comical rather than scary in their movement and actions and the father seems like such an irresponsible, dumb redneck muppet. an edgy, thriller-type scenario is introduced with an ex-con returning to the town near the crash site to be met by his somewhat emotionless, dull now cop friend from the bus. when i say introduced i mean a feeble attempt with crap actors and no feeling is played out. a slasher/horror element is then introduced with a sexy girl and the usual supposedly nerdy or somehow undesirable cute guy who gets beaten up by the over protective, crazy, nasty jock type (american sportsman not a scottish man). oh the cute/not cute boy is the ex-con\\'s brother by the way. yes they\\'re clever these director brothers whose name i will research in order to avoid any other shite they put out again. then a modern role reversal oh so boring attempt at pc, ripley credential type character introduction comes with a female soldier returning home to her husband and child. guess what happens next? i won\\'t tell you much more about the actual (smiles sadly to himself about the demise of storytelling in the large majority of recent films) plot just in case you have got this far and are not the brightest star in the alien-ridden universe. the predator is stupid for the reasons stated by the previous poster whose post i read too late. the aliens are boring. the predator-alien is ridiculous. the action is at times exploitative, gratuitous, disgusting nonsense. the hospital scene with the pregnant mothers?!?! oh i was shocked alright. shocked at how low some people will go to get what? a scare? some shock? to titillate the perverse? what? if you really wanted to shock, titillate and scare people who are not pregnant or expecting fathers or who have no souls why not just have the alien/predator shagging the saucy women and teenage girls rather than killing them? the characters have no depth and neither does the plot. it\\'s filmed and paced badly. it\\'s acted by disinterested people not that i can blame them. it further tarnishes two rather interesting and good sets of sci-fi characters. this film was rubbish and if you gain enjoyment from it i really have to worry about you. if you haven\\'t seen it then well please make your own decision. ps did i even mention the way that trained soldiers are all killed in about 20 seconds while amateur civilians survive throughout? even though i saw this film when i was very young, i already knew the story of wild the thief-taker and shepherd who famously escaped from newgate prison. apart from the liberty taken right at the end, the film more or less faithfully follows the true story. the temptation to bend the facts which is the hallmark of so many so-called historical films is resisted in this film and the film makers must be praised for that. of the performances, there is scarcely a poor performance, and tommy steele is ideally cast. also good is stanley baker as the thief-taker and alan badel is good as always. because the film sticks to the facts, it makes it suitable to be watched by all the family. gone is the wonderful campiness of the original. in place is a c-grade action no-brainer, wich is not all bad, but pales in comparison to the original. all the meaningless sex and violence is gone, and replaced with crappy jokes and unexplained plot pointers. see it, but don\\'t expect the thrills of the first. although most americans have little knowledge of his work other than star wars, alec guinness produced an amazing body of work--particularly in the 1940s-1950s--ranging from dramas to quirky comedies. i particularly love his comedies, as they are so well-done and seem so natural and real on the screen--far different from the usual fare from hollywood. this being said, this was the film that sparked my interest in these movies. it\\'s plot was so odd and cute that it is very unlikely the film would have been made anywhere--except for ealing studios--which had a particular fondness for \"little\" films like this one. guinness is a nerdy little scientist that works for a textile company. he wants to experiment in order to create a synthetic fabric that is indestructible, though he is not working for the company as a researcher but for janitorial work! so, he tends to sneak into labs (either during the day if no one suspects or at night) and try his hand at inventing. repeatedly, he is caught (such as after he blew up the lab) and given the boot until one day he actually succeeds! then, despite the importance of the discovery, he sets off a completely unanticipated chain of events--and then the fun begins. the film is a wonderful satire that pokes fun at industry, unions, the government and people in general. victor mclaglen\\'s performance is one of the finest in film history. i think we can all feel for \"gypo\" because we\\'ve all struggled with what is right and what isn\\'t and been wrong. this was one of the first art-house pictures to be released by a major american movie studio (rko radio pictures). joseph h. august\\'s cinematography is at its very best here. however, august\\'s stunning portion was mostly overlooked; he didn\\'t receive the oscar nomination he rightly deserved. this is a psychological drama, with thought, philosophy, sadness, all conveyed with as little words as possible. how do you take a cast of experienced, well-known actors, and put together such a stupid movie? nimrod antel has the answer: armored. six co-workers at an armored car business decide to steal a large shipment of cash themselves. but, just as they get to first base with their plans, everything unravels quickly. with a plot like this, you\\'d think it couldn\\'t be too bad, at least for an action movie. however, in the first 40 minutes or more of this movie we see what appear to be 6 normal, everyday kind of guys. they joke, they laugh, have a few drinks together, etc. then, we suddenly learn they\\'re planning to rob their own business. the hero ty, (columbus short), is sucked into the scheme because of the cold, cruel world, even though he\\'s a decorated veteran, nice guy, and reliable employee. oh my, oh my! then in the last 40 minutes of the film, these former regular guys nearly all turn into money-crazed psychos, willing to butcher each other for cash. in the last scenes mike, (matt dillon), goes on a suicidal rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend. the viewer has no hint before this ending that these men are this ruthless and bloodthirsty. it\\'s utterly unbelievable and \"b movie\" is almost too kind for this sort of cheesy plot. i would say don\\'t waste your time--too bad no one gave laurence fishburne, jean reno or fred ward the same advice before making this picture. the sexploitation movie era of the late sixties and early seventies began with the allowance of gratuitous nudity in mainstream films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn. it\\'s peak years were between 1968 and 1972. one of the most loved and talented actresses of the era was monica gayle, who had a small but fanatic cult of followers. she was actually able to act, unlike many who filled the lead roles of these flicks, and her subsequent credits proved it. and her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career was taking off only heightens her mystique. gary graver, the director, was also a talent; probably too talented for the sexploitation genre, and his skill, combined with monica gayle\\'s screen presence, makes sandra, the making of a woman, a pleasantly enjoyable experience. the film never drags and you won\\'t have your finger pressed on the fast-forward button. what a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be. this is the type of film that i\\'ve been looking for ages. particularly important for me was the fantastic-looking chicago, which i still keep thinking about. the back cover doesn\\'t do this film justice, it\\'s superb, and in my top-5 for sure. i did not expect much from this film, but boy-o-boy, i did not expect the movie to be this bad. chris rock is not showing a good act here, you can\\'t get the feeling that his caracter is real, i think the movie would have been a bit better if it\\'s drama or romantic scenes would have been a less part of the movie and more/better humor was involved. the movie is like the film makers were having a bad hangover making it. in the \"making of\" they don\\'t show a single smile. this is a very bad film! i gave it three out of ten because of few smiles it gave me, but i did never laugh! i cant believe there are people out there that did not like this movie! i thought it was the funniest movie i had ever seen. it my have been b/c i am mel brooks biggest fan... i know almost all the words and get very discouraged when they censor them, when it is played on a family channel. :) this is one of my favorite movies, so i dont know why any one would disagree! thanks kristina flynn, known mostly for his swashbuckling roles (and his bedroom antics!) takes a different tack with this film and it works beautifully. playing real-life boxing champ jim corbett, flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled san francisco bank teller to a celebrated pugilist, all the while setting one eye on society deb smith. he and best pal carson attend an illegal bare-knuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men (and a dog!) including a prominent judge. the next day, he gets a chance, via smith, to gain entrance to the judge\\'s private club. he uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land a spot as the club\\'s resident boxer. his unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers, up to and including the world champion john l. sullivan (bond.) flynn is downright magical here. he is the epitome of charm, charisma and appeal in this role. he looks terrific (especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing a white union suit) and does virtually all of his own stuntwork (impressively!) his line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally. smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for flynn. at this stage, he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation (he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time) and she does so admirably. she is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude, yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell. bond is incredibly burly, brawny and towering, yet tender when the script calls for it. amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient carson. frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as flynn\\'s manager. the rest of the cast is excellent as well including flynn\\'s rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy nob hill types. the whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed. a few of the sets are amazingly presented. some of smith\\'s gowns border on the garish, but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well. it\\'s a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing, but it\\'s also so much more. some of it (like the character traits shown by flynn) is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purposes, but a lot of it is authentic (like the methods and costumes shown in the fight scenes.) one line is particularly memorable: \"i believe you like me more than i like you, but it\\'s entirely possible that i love you more than you love me.\" it\\'s classic romantic dialogue (and there are more than a few zingers sprinkled throughout the script as well.) often laugh out loud funny play on sex, family, and the classes in beverly hills milks more laughs out of the zip code than it\\'s seen since the days of granny and jed clampett. plot centers on two chauffers who\\'ve bet on which one of them can bed his employer (both single or soon to be single ladies, quite sexy -- bisset and woronov) first. if manuel wins, his friend will pay off his debt to a violent asian street gang -- if he loses, he must play bottom man to his friend! lots of raunchy dialogue, fairly sick physical humour, etc. but a lot of the comedy is just beneath the surface. bartel is memorable as a very sensual oder member of the family who ends up taking his sexy, teenaged niece on a year long \"missionary trip\" to africa. hilarious fun. thought provoking, humbling depiction of the human tragedies of war. a small, but altruistic view of one family\\'s interactions with the enemy during the civil war in kentucky. this movie lessens the \"glamor\" of war; showing it\\'s effect on not only the soldier but the entire family unit. a lot of today\\'s movies show war as an opportunity to highlight the \"hero\\'s\" and other glamorous features of war, but very little attempts to show the true effect war actually takes on a community. this movie attempts this through a retelling of a person\\'s memory of those days. this movie is stated to be loose translation of an actual events, when in reality, this movie is probably a factual reality of hundreds, perhaps thousands of \"actual events\" during the civil war. i highly recommend those interested in our civil war to watch this movie. or anyone else have noticed the fact that first bunch of episodes are inspired too much by 90\\'s flicks? i mean seriously wife who is trying get someone else to murder his rich husband so she can claim his assets. med students who are temporarily stopping their hearts to reach memories that are lost; flatliners. bunch of college bodies getting together again to reminisce on the old days but are not fully comfortable because they did something in the past, very bad things? groundhog day is one of my all time favorite movies. sadly enough the writing staff behind his turd is bunch of lazy bastards who can not come up with their original scripts. noble idea totally fubarred in it\\'s execution. elvira mistress of the dark is one of my fav movies, it has every thing you would want in a film, like great one liners, sexy star and a outrageous story! if you have not seen it, you are missing out on one of the greatest films made. i can\\'t wait till her new movie comes out! i saw this movie on the hallmark channel and thought it was wonderful, especially since it was based on a true man. pierce brosnan was very good as the loner english man who took on the persona of the half breed grey owl. the photography was beautiful. this movie made me do more research into this character archie belaney known simple as grey owl. i want to read as much as i can about him. at the time i did not know richard attenborough had directed it. but i am not surprised. i like all his movies whether he is acting or directing. i gave it the highest rating. however, i would have liked to have seen more in the movie about why he took on this persona as it only showed the two aunts who raised him and his room in their house. you can\\'t go wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story without hearing foul language and contrived special effects every few minutes. despite having an absolutely horrid script (more about that later), this film is still vaguely watchable just because it stars two excellent actors, barbara stanwyck and henry fonda. aside from one or two real stinkers, i\\'d probably watch just about anything with them in the film, as i am a huge fan of hollywood\\'s golden age of the 1930s and 40s. however, no matter how much i love their films, i just can\\'t recommend this film. the movie begins with fonda and stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort. the two haven\\'t yet met, but the film begins loudly and obnoxiously with a scene in which fonda horribly yodels while skiing. it was done so unsubtly and made my teeth grind but i stuck it out--especially when fonda fell into a snow bank and this stopped the yodeling!! in hindsight, perhaps i should have just turned it off then! fonda is knocked out in the fall and barbara goes for help. back at the ski lodge, he seems okay but fortunately she is also a doctor and has him x-rayed and nurses him back to health. he, in turn, becomes infatuated with her and proposes to her. despite hardly knowing each other, they marry and so far the film seems like a sweet but very slight romantic comedy. once home, however, all isn\\'t rosy as she jumps right back into her job as a family doctor and he begins exhibiting signs that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous man due to his jealousy. the film plays it all for laughs, but frankly fonda\\'s behaviors were really creepy--spying on her and her male patients, attacking or threatening any man she treats, tripping a patient who already has a back injury and stomping into a surprise party and insisting that everyone there (men and women) are out to steal away his wife. he comes off as a combination of a sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic, but it\\'s all supposed to be for laughs. considering that he seems like a dangerous nut, you would think that stanwyck would file for an annulment along with a restraining order! but, oddly, she gets mad but just can\\'t stay mad at fonda because he\\'s so........? i can\\'t think of the right word--\\'creepy\\' is all that comes to mind!!! later, out of the blue, multi-millionaire fonda gets a job working the counter at a department store. then, through magical thinking, he and babs seem to assume his hostility and violent jealousy is all a thing of the past--so a job apparently cures anger and suspicions. when this job falls through, the film ends with fonda buying his own hospital, giving barbara a job there and they live happily ever after. they don\\'t go any further with the story, but i assume based on fonda\\'s character that he then spent most of his time as hospital administrator beating up all the male patients. the first portion at the ski lodge and the next did not fit well together, nor did the final \"horatio alger\" inspired section where the rich boy made good in the business world. they were like three separate plots but despite this, the most serious problem with the film was its seeming to excuse away domestic violence and delusional jealousy! what a creepy little film! thank goodness neither fonda nor stanwyck are known for this yechy film but for all their other lovely films. i find the critique of many imdb users a little harsh and in many cases find that they crit the movie from a very professional viewpoint and not that of the guy on the street that wants to sit and watch something just to get away from it all. in this case however i have to say it was bad. i am a scifi junkie and there was nothing in this movie that grabbed me for even one second. there was no proper storyline. i may be an idiot but i still do not know where the government was that was so worried about these pieces. the pathetic attempt by the main character to put together these 3 pieces is scary. half the time the two pieces were already in place and he simply had to add the third. a 3 year old kid would have been able to put them together. this movie was bad. dominic i was debating between this movie and 2012 but chose inglourious basterds due to it\\'s amazingly high imdb rating. i must say now, what a disappointment. i expected a certain amount of gratuitous violence, but i also expected a lot of witty dialog. i got a huge dosage of the former, but not nearly enough of the latter. i felt shortchanged. the ratio between violence to plot is very important and i think this movie gets it totally wrong. and the plot? it\\'s that believable or really all that entertaining either. save your time and money. i can\\'t believe what this rating says for the gory and violent tastes of the modern masses. bend it like beckham is packed with intriguing scenes yet has an overall predictable stroy line. it is about a girl called jess who is trying to achieve her life long dream to become a famous soccer player and finally gets the chance when offered a position on a local team. there are so many boundaries and limits that she faces which hold her back yet she is still determined and strives. i would recommend it for anyone who likes a nice light movie and wants to get inspired by what people can achieve. the song choices are really good, \\'hush my child, just move on up...to your destination and you make boundaries and complications.\\' anyway hope that was at help to your needs in a review. bend it like beckham great flick directed by diane keaton and adapted from a book by franz lidz. a young mother selma lidz(andie macdowell)is battling a very serious illness and her self proclaimed inventor husband sid(john tururro)is a little lacking in the emotions department. unhappy with the new home situation, their sensitive son steven(nathan watt)decides he wants to stay with his two eccentric uncles danny(michael richards)and melvin(lou cutell)until his mom is well. steven seems to be happier and even takes interest in his strange uncle\\'s living habits; he even decides he wants to change his name to franz. set in the early 60\\'s, this drama is a bit comedic...change that to zany. not being a macdowell fan, unstrung heroes assures my attitude; albeit i enjoyed the film and it is not a total waste. perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movies is otto preminger\\'s \\'where the sidewalks ends,\\' from a really excellent script by ben hecht based on the novel \\'night cry\\' by frank rosenberg... dana andrews is the honest, tough new york policeman, always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strong-arm methods as much as he detests crooks... when he hit someone, his knuckles hurt... and the man he wants to hit is a smooth villain (gary merrill) who points up the title. \\'why are you always trying to push me in the gutter?\\' he asks andrews. \\'i have as much right on the sidewalk as you.\\' dana andrew\\'s obsession and neurosis are implanted in his hidden, painful discovery that he is the son of a thief... his deep hatred of criminals led him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them, and the pursuit of justice became spoiled in private vendetta... by a twist of irony unique to the film itself, dana andrews and gene tierney of \\'laura\\' are united once more, and andrews now seems to be playing the same detective a few years later, but no longer the romantic, beaten down by his job, by the cheap crooks... this time, he goes too far, and accidentally kills a suspect... the killing is accidental, the victim worthless, yet it is a crime that he knows can break him or send him to jail... using his knowledge of police procedure, he covers up his part in the crime, plants false clues, and tries to implicate a gang leader, but cannot avoid investigating the case himself... the double tension of following the larger case through to its conclusion without implicating himself in the murder, is beautifully maintained and the final solution is both logical, satisfying, and in no way a compromise... the film is one of the best detective films of the 50\\'s, with curious moral values, also one of preminger\\'s best... preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique, projecting pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism... in sum, overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes! the director and co-writer says he wanted to mix genres - in this case drama and comedy. well, at least here, these two mix like vinegar and oil. to boot, the comedy is not very funny and juvenile. additionally, the film is not really realistic. liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing french citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in french hospitals. i watched this film on my big screen tv at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on. eventually toward the end i fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his ex-lover\\'s son. by that time i was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover, marriage of convenience and a nutty ex-lover. at times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them - either ismael or primarily nora. to the detriment of the audience, viewpoints keep changing from nora and ismael, her ex-lover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital. there probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed. the epilogue does not really wrap up many of the sub-plots and seems to want the viewer to believe nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow ball\\'s chance in hell. the actors do their best and are appealing, but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing, editing and lack of focus. incomprehensibly dreadful mishmash of the probably most notorious of all roman emperors who went insane, leaving infamous party orgies and ruthless killings in his path... i know there are several versions of this, and this is based on the 102 min\\' one that i watched - but i can\\'t fathom how that possibly can make any difference to lift the rest of this movie out of the muck! i\\'d heard for long about the alleged \"shocking\" content of sex/nudity (which honestly there isn\\'t much of here at all - and boring when there is) and blood, but beware - it\\'s the technical production amateurishness that well and truly shocks here: everything looks plain and simply like a junior film school flunk project! camera-work is hopelessly inept, full of strange zooms, failed framing and confusing pans (to and from what mostly looks like a huge theater stage!) complete with a grainy, cheapish photo quality. lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven - is it day or night? are they in- or outside? have they changed scenes? who is, or is meant to be in the shot? editing is the final sin here, making a confusing mess of everything with randomly jumpy cutaways, continuity flaws and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum, story progression - and involvement. there is potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story... but these faults distract so much it\\'s tragic. a story with so many possibilities to be great is just one gargantuan, burnt (and fellini-like) turkey that\\'s only good for a few gobble-laughs and peter o\\'toole, who makes a most memorable tiberius. oh yes, which brings us to the big-name actors. i\\'d like to line them all up one by one and just ask: who did you get free access to bonk in the orgies to be a part of this? there, i\\'ve wasted enough lines on one of the truly worst films of all time - period! 1 out of 10 from ozjeppe did anyone edit this film? or was it only the dvd release that had huge thirty second gaps between scenes? it\\'s ok though, i fell asleep watching it the first time. then i fell asleep the second time and the third time. the plot is actually not the worst i\\'ve seen, but it\\'s close. the acting is not the worst i\\'ve seen either...but it\\'s close. the production .... well, i can honestly say that it was the worst i had ever seen in my life! not trying to be spiteful, but unhinged could have used some more production. please don\\'t think i\\'m a hater of horror films, or even that i didn\\'t enjoy this film. i just felt i was laughing at the film much more than i felt i was laughing along with it. the gruesome moments were not too poorly done, but could have been done better even with a shoestring budget. characters seemed awkwardly developed, or ignored all together, twist ending was pretty bad, and the exposition took forever without exposing much. i\\'d recommend avoiding this movie. 1/10 riding high on the success of \"rebel without a cause\", came a tidal wave of \\'teen\\' movies. arguably this is one of the best. a very young mcarthur excels here as the not really too troubled teen. the story concentrates more on perceptions of delinquency, than any traumatic occurrence. the supporting cast is memorable, frankenheimer directs like an old pro. just a story of a young man that finds others take his actions much too seriously. most of the comments on this movie are positive so i thought i would try and redress the balance. i came out of this movie wondering what was going on. i now know and still consider it to be a poor movie. i intially discounted a dream sequence as that seemed too obvious. i was glad that i had a free ticket to the movie or i would have asked for my money back. movie reviewers and critics love this movie, which only confirms to me that most of them would rather sound intelligent than review how an audience may enjoy a film. the 8+ rating this movie has is so misleading. in 20 years time this film will not compare to true greats such as the godfather. the film does have fine performances from both the leads but that isn\\'t enough to save the film. (nor are the lesbian scenes!) pepe le moko, played by charles boyer, is some sort of international criminal mastermind wanted in countries throughout europe, and to stay free he holes himself up in the casbah, a mysterious part of algiers where even the police are reluctant to go, until a senior officer is sent from paris to capture le moko once and for all. for le moko, although the casbah allows him to remain out of police custody, it also becomes a sort of prison at the same time - a place he can\\'t leave, because the moment he does, he knows he\\'ll be arrested. boyer\\'s performance was good, and i can understand why he was nominated for an oscar. he captures the essence of such a character - a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time. the movie itself, unfortunately, was quite a letdown. a number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent, of which i\\'ll mention two. first was the idea that the police wouldn\\'t enter the casbah. that was stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander, and yet repeated references in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the casbah fairly regularly. so, neither the suggestion by commissioner janvier that the police wouldn\\'t enter, nor the statement by inspector slimane (also a decent performance by joseph calleia) that they could get into the casbah but not out seemed to make much sense. i also found it difficult to believe that le moko - hardened criminal mastermind that he was - could be so quickly swept off his feet by gaby (hedy lamarr) to the point where he entertains the local populace by singing love songs and then leaves the casbah to find her, essentially giving himself up. i understand the irony of the final few scenes, of course, as pepe leaves the freedom of his prison (the casbah) only to find real freedom in his capture (because he\\'s shot and killed by the police.) i just found it impossible to believe that someone like le moko would fall into such a trap. this is worth watching for boyer, and to a lesser extent calleia, but the story is disappointing and inconsistent. 3/10 man with the screaming brain certainly isn\\'t a perfect movie, but i\\'m pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for bruce campbell, meaning it works as kind of a summary of his entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings. campbell is, as a writer, uneven--there are lots of things in the story that don\\'t make a great deal of sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it?), and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other, better incarnations (the scene in the restaurant, where yegor and william battle for control of william\\'s body, is straight out of evil dead ii). there are, however, lots of little touches and non-sequiturs that feel rather brilliant, such as when william is in the height of his panic and screams at a statue, \"what are you looking at?!\" the movie looks like a sci-fi channel original, probably because it was. the acting is actually pretty good. i particularly enjoyed tamara gorski as tatoya; she was ruthless and cunning, yes, but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored. ted raimi handled the standard \"bumbling assistant\" role admirably enough, and bruce is funny as the arrogant, sardonic, condescending american jerk. (now that he\\'s writing his own films, you\\'d think he\\'d give himself a role that he hasn\\'t been typecast in already.) man with the screaming brain is a bizarre, nonsensical b-movie that ought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously. you should never ever even consider to watch this movie! it is absolutely awful! this isn\\'t an overstatement!! it is so unbelievable and exaggerated, it gets boring. it is just a movie where they have taken stories and plots from several movies and put it together in one. they writer hasn\\'t been able to pull it off in a good way. if you\\'d like to see pretty girls in bikinis and no brain this might be the movie for you, but still, you should plug your ears and just watch. it\\'s not worth listening:p there are so many great movies out there, and if i could choose one, this would be the last movie i would pick. but all in all, it\\'s your choice!!! enjoy! tell the truth iâ€™m a bit stun to see all these positive review by so many people, which is also the main reason why i actually decide to see this movie. and after having seen it, i was really a disappointed, and this comes from the guy that loves this genre of movie. iâ€™m surprise at this movie all completely â€“ it is like a kidâ€™s movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involve little children cursing and swearing. iâ€™m not at all righteous but this has really gone too far in my account. synopsis: the story about two guys got send to the big brother program for their reckless behavior. there they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is a medieval freak. just the name it self is not really connected with the story at all. they are not being a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done. the story is very predictable (though expected) and the humor is lame. and havenâ€™t we already seen the same characters (play by mc lovinâ€™) in so many other movies (like sasquatch gang?). i think i laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep. well the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay. and the acting is so-so as expected when youâ€™re watching this type of movie. and the direction, what do one expect? this is the same guy who brought us wet hot american summer, and that movie also sucks. but somehow he always managed to bring in some star to attract his horrendous movie. anyway i felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time. only the naked scenes seem to be the best part in the movie. canâ€™t really see any point why i should recommend this to anyone. pros: elizabeth bank? two topless scenes. cons: not funny, dreadful story, nudity and kids do not mix together. rating: 3.5/10 (grade: f) this film held my interest enough to watch it several times. the plot has holes, but the lead performers make it work. catherine mary stewart (julia kerbridge), does a great job as a woman of 37 who has sacrificed everything else to become a physician. she worked years to earn the money to go to medical school. she is performing brilliantly in her residency and is just about to take her board exam and realize her dream. meanwhile, julia\\'s sister and brother-in-law are murdered and as the nearest living relative she is compelled to take in her niece amanda (arlen aguayo-stewart) to avoid having her become a ward of the state. amanda is about 7 years old from her appearance. amanda is so traumatized from her parent\\'s murder that she has become mute. needless to say, julia\\'s 16-hour days get longer caring for amanda. rob lowe plays kevin finney, a charming neighbor man in their apartment building who works his way into the lives of julia and amanda. he is always there with a trick or a joke to help amanda deal with her distress. amanda really starts to warm up to kevin as the film progresses, perhaps more than to her aunt. julia starts to rely on kevin to take some of the load of caring for amanda as she attempts to handle her case load and prepare for her board examination. kevin is always there whenever some crisis erupts for julia. the chemistry between rob and catherine mary was great. you keep watching to see them get together before the end of the film. the chemistry between rob and arlen was good as well. arlen managed to convey quite a lot without the benefit of words. the plot had julia and amanda gradually warming up to each other. you can see them working out a relationship as the film progresses. we discover that julia\\'s sister and brother-in-law (the meyers) were involved in industrial espionage. they stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer. they had three associates who intended to share the proceeds of the theft. julia discovers that the meyers were planning to skip the country under assumed identities. the plot is unclear whether the meyers intended to double cross their associates or were themselves double crossed. in any case the meyers are murdered in their home by 2 of their former associates. the killers make no attempt to extract the location of the microchip from the meyers before killing them. the killers search the home and fail to find their prize. they leave a living witness to their crime, amanda. the killers then spend the remainder of the film making clumsy attempts to extract the microchip from julia and amanda who have no idea where the prize is located. eventually, the killers kidnap amanda in hopes she knows something about the microchip\\'s location. eventually julia discovers the truth about kevin. he is an investigator hired to recover the stolen microchip. after some rough moments in the relationship they manage to rescue amanda and dispatch the bad guys. the predictable ending has the three forming a family and moving happily into a future together. what struck me about the plot were major holes. kevin moves into the same apartment building as julia and amanda the day after the murder of the meyers. how does he know that the microchip is not already in the hands of the killers? the killers blithely leave fingerprints at the murder scene, with no concern for concealing their identity. the killer that pretends to be a psychiatrist is revealed to amanda by the remnants of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe soles. he was not shown in the murder scene at the start of the film. there are other weaknesses along these lines too numerous to mention. the film could have been a lot better if the script had been refined more before filming. filling in the plot holes would have added little expense and greatly improved the effort. like the previous poster, i am from northern vermont, and i was inclined to like this film. however, not since \"red zone cuba\" have i seen such a confusing plot. the things the people to bootleg make no sense. two of the gang paddle across the border send a second party across in a car. uhm, why? then they meet two others, and drive up at night in to the bad guy\\'s hideout in a luxury packard. --wouldn\\'t just two people in a flatbed truck make more sense? then, parked outside the garage that holds the targeted hooch, the four fall asleep! when they waken in the morning and and start hauling the whiskey out, of course they\\'re spotted and shot at, losing some of their precious cargo in the process. then two of the smugglers put the whiskey in a boat and float it over the border. again, why? i am told by someone whose great uncle really did smuggle in the area, all one needed was to drive a vehicle that could outrun than the u.s. canada border patrol, which back then had a fraction of the resources it has now. and don\\'t get me started on the last half hour, which made no sense whatsoever. the only good thing i can say about the film is that kris kristopherson has actually grown some charisma with the years. may contain spoilers. this movie was the worst movie ever. i couldn\\'t even watch it all it was so bad. this film is actually worse than scarecrow slayer which is saying a whole lot. this was worse than terror toons which at least terror toons was funny at times. not even the gore in the film was good. the shootings were fake and the acting was worse. please do yourself a favor and skip this one. if you see it at the rental store then run the other way. there is nothing good about this film at all. if you want to see a good scarecrow movie then watch night of the scarecrow or pumpkin head. if you want to see an ok new cheesy movie then watch scarecrow. i rate this movie a 0.2 out of 10. that\\'s how horrible this film really is. the worst movie ever. watched this last night and was bowled over by the heartfelt story line, the excellent character development, and the good karmic vibe emanating from the acting and movie as a whole. without giving away too much of the plot, it begins with an ordinary joe who commutes to his office job every day who becomes inspired to take dance lessons. along the way the protagonist and the assorted characters he meets in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learn lessons about others and about themselves. the story has a prologue about what dancing in japan symbolizes sociologically, so it isn\\'t exactly as simple to learn to dance in japan as it is here in the u.s. the film is lighthearted; you\\'ll laugh out loud at some of the sight gags. yet it is also dignified in a way hard to describe. all of the film\\'s characters are taken seriously, as they are, and none are diminished because of their \"imperfections.\" i\\'ve been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends. it just so happened a friend lent me the video on learning to dance. is this synchronous or what? i think so because now i\\'m really geeked to give it a try. watch this wonderful family film (small children might not get it, but teens certainly would) and smile at the genuine caring you see shown in it time and again. why they would make a remake of shall we dance is a mystery, as it is perfect as-is. recap: something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signals is discovered in the ice of antarctica. the mysterious block is dug out and brought to a research station on antarctica. julian rome, a former seti-worker, is brought in to decipher the message. problem is that one of the researchers is a old girlfriend of his, and the situation quickly turns awkward, especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him. and the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly. soon the object is in the open. the mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity. it is decided to open the object, but just before that is done, julian decodes the signal. \"do not open\". but too late, and the object explodes as it is finally breached, and two things unleashed on earth. the first is an alien, that had been dormant in the object, and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff. and washington, that is suspiciously updated on this historic event, decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth. so a russian nuclear submarine, carrying nuclear weapons is sent to antarctica. comments: the movie holds a few surprises. one is carl lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance, and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful, well worked through and a lot better than expected. unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own, and this time not in a good way. actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes. it is never really explained why washington know so much, why washington is able to command russian submarines, why the object is in the antarctic and has woken up now. it is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable english. some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to earth before and knew the language (and obviously chose english, why?). but then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the earth from the virus, send their \"do not open\" message encoded! and finally the end is as open as an end can be. the movie is a little entertaining but too much energy (from me) must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot. therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good. 3/10 this movie features charlie spradling dancing in a strip club. beyond that, it features a truly bad script with dull, unrealistic dialogue. that it got as many positive votes suggests some people may be joking. had i checked imdb before renting this dvd from netflix, i\\'d have a couple of hours of my life back. i\\'m frankly suspicious when i see that a film\\'s director also wrote it. in this case, according to the credits, the same guy was \"writter and director\" - unfortunately, an indication of the overall quality of this production. there were a few interesting moments (e.g., judy tenuta\\'s scene reminded of her early comedy routines touting judy-ism) which led me to rate this two stars rather than one. those moments, however, were few and far between ... and i almost did not get to see them because the opening sequence was nearly incomprehensible to me, not to mention reprehensible in its violence. i admit i went back to watch that part again to see if i had missed something that would help me figure it out once i\\'d seen the whole thing. nope, though i at least recognized who the characters were who would turn out to be important later. the \"spinning camera\" technique was overused and essentially pointless. i found myself talking to the tv screen: \"what?!?\" or \"for goodness sake, get on with it!\" not recommended. the endless bounds of our inhumanity to our own kind never fails to stun me. this truly astonishing story of a horrifically abused and largely unheard-of population is compelling, well-documented and enraging. as an american, i am constantly humiliated by my country\\'s behaviour and this is just another in our long catalogue of international debasement. we suck. this is probably the first john pilger documentary i\\'ve seen, but it immediately made me want to see what else he\\'s done. my only complaint, and the reason i gave this film only 8 out of 10, is that pilger shows us this travesty and the appalling collaboration of the us and uk governments, demands that we viewers/citizens are complicit in our own inaction...but makes no suggestion of how to help. i don\\'t know about britain, but america\\'s made it nearly impossible for the citizenry to take part in their government\\'s doings. a gesture in the right direction might help these islanders\\' cause. this flick is so bad its beyond belief.even for an independent low budget film...it just, well, sucks.i can\\'t even believe even troma would put out such crap.i have been a fan of some troma flicks for years(toxic avenger,squeeze play,rockabilly vampire to name a few).but lloyd, come on,this goes way beyond the boundaries of any taste.it features some of the worst acting imaginable.i think it would have been possible to find unemployed street people who could have been as good...oh,wait, that is what they did.i mean it,these characters have negative charisma.with any luck, the producer and director of this film will have a huge karmic debt because of this atrocity.as will the special effects people.but beyond the terrible acting and the horrid special effects,the dialogue is absolutely traumatic to the ears.the script is full of plot holes the size of alaska, and there are severe continuity problems.the worst part however, is that it not entertaining in even the smallest way.and this is the most unforgivable sin in film making.but, don\\'t take my word for it.go out and waste four bucks renting it.just don\\'t say i didn\\'t warn you. this is a very memorable spaghetti western. it has a great storyline, interesting characters, and some very good acting, especially from rosalba neri. her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic. she steals every scene she is in, and expresses so much with her face and eyes, even when she\\'s not speaking. her performance is very believable. she manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top (not that there\\'s anything wrong with being over the top). mark damon is surprisingly good in this movie too. the music score is excellent, and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie, whether you want it to or not. there are a couple of parts that are very amusing. i especially like the part where rosalba neri undresses in front of the parrot. there\\'s also lots of slick gun-play that\\'s very well done. i would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn\\'t for two things. the first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minutes into the film. this is one of the most ridiculous looking fights i have ever seen in a movie. it is very poorly choreographed, and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight. one might be able to overlook this if it were a terence hill/bud spencer comedy, but this is a more serious western, and the brawl really needed to be more realistic. the other thing that annoyed me about this movie was yuma\\'s cowardly mexican sidekick. i guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something, but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and he wasn\\'t at all funny. all i can say is where is tuco when you need him? all that having been said, let me assure everyone reading this that johnny yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults i have mentioned, and all fans of the genre need to see this movie. the plot: michael linnett connors has done everything in films but direct, and is looking for his 1st big chance. he discovers molly in a play and at once knows she will be a big film star. he signs her to a contract with the stipulation that he must direct. the producer agrees and their big time careers are under way. what follows is a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with great emphasis on comedy. and, oh yes, there\\'s romance, and a little sadness too. the performances by don ameche and alice fay are top notch. the music is a real plus too with some old familiar tunes heard. lots of dvd extras as well in this restored version released in 2008. it must be emphasized that this movie is a story 1st, not just a tribute to silent films. later years would bring similar films such as, singin\\' in the rain(1952) & dick van dyke-carl reiner\\'s, the comic(1969). what is special about this film, though, is recreating silent movies in 1939. we see portions of them as the cinema audience would in that bygone era(although some sound effects are included)in glorious b&w, while the rest of the movie is in pristine color. one of the greatest in the silent era, buster keaton, who at this point was on an uphill climb, is used superbly in 2 silent film recreated scenes and he is on the top of his game! it is said that he had some input on his scenes as well. but the real reason to watch the movie, if your a motion picture history fan, is that beyond everything else, hollywood cavalcade is mack sennett\\'s film legacy. it doesn\\'t take a genius to realize this movie is a \"positive\" reworking of mack sennett\\'s and mabel normand\\'s life. the character michael \"linnett\" connors is mack sennett, whose real name was michael sinnott. and molly, of course is mabel. sennett had the pie throwings, the bathing beauties and keystone cops. he worked with buster keaton, ben turpin(cameo), roscoe \"fatty\" arbuckle(body double) and fell in love with his leading lady. not only all that, but sennett was technical adviser for this film and appears in it as well. as most film viewers today prefer sound features, those who were associated with short subjects and silents are left out to pasture. as mack sennett fell into that category, it is fortunate that there is hollywood cavalcade! sennett was of course very instrumental in the evolution of comedy in movies. his career started in 1908 as an actor, then writer, director & producer. he semi retired in 1935 with about 500 films to his credit. he had worked with the best, such as charlie chaplin, gloria swanson, bing crosby, w.c. fields, keaton, harry langdon, arbuckle, and even roy rogers(in way up thar).as film comedy is an extremely difficult path to continue for an entire career, mack played it wise & did only selective work for the next 25 years. in 1931 he had receive an academy award in the short subject category, and another in 1937 for a lifetime of work. in the 1940\\'s his presence was still felt, e.g. here come the co-eds(1945)where a recreation of the oyster soup scene used in mack\\'s wandering willies(1926)is done. in 1947, the road to hollywood, used some of sennett\\'s crosby films. 2 years later brought some nostalgia with the film down memory lane in which he participated. with his knack of always associating with the right people, a guest role with the eternally popular lawrence welk & his radio show came about later in the year. 1950 brought a re-release of his greatest triumph, tillie\\'s punctured romance(1914) with sound. in 1952 he was honored on tv\\'s, this is your life, then his autobiography, the king of comedy(1954), which is a great companion piece to hollywood cavalcade, was published. 1955 brought a more concrete association with abbott & costello, as he had a cameo in a&c meet the keystone kops. finally in 1957, another tribute with the compilation film, the golden age of comedy. so when you watch hollywood cavalcade it is the legacy of a motion picture pioneer. in the film at the banquet scene the camera pans over the guests at a long table. as we get to the silver haired mack, he alone turns his head to the camera as if to say, \"here i am!\". when he rises to give a speech a short while later, he is at his most subdued, underplaying the words given him as if to mentally convey, \"i know my influence on comedy will never end, but will people forget mack sennett the individual. maybe this movie will help.\" it got to be a running joke around bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any cartwright men. after all ben cartwright was three times a widower with a son by each marriage. and any woman who got involved with adam, hoss, and little joe were going to end up dying because we couldn\\'t get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons that started this classic tv western. perhaps if bonanza were being done today the writers would have had revolving women characters who came in and out of the lives of the cartwrights. people have relationships, some go good, some not so good, it\\'s just life. and we\\'re less demanding of our heroes today so if a relationship with one of them goes south we don\\'t have to kill the character off to keep the survivor\\'s nobility intact. but that\\'s if bonanza were done today. but we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from nbc certainly helped, the secret of bonanza\\'s success was the noble patriarch ben cartwright and his stalwart sons. ben cartwright was the ideal tv dad in any genre you want to name. his whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense ponderosa spread for his three children. the kids were all different in personality, but all came together in a pinch. the cartwrights became and still are an american institution. i daresay more people cared about this family than the kennedys. just the popularity that bonanza has in syndication testifies to that. pernell roberts as oldest son adam was written out of the show. rumor has it he didn\\'t care for the noble cartwright characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious. perhaps if it were done now, he\\'d have liked it better in the way i describe. this was just the beginning for michael landon, how many people get three hit tv shows to their credit. landon also has highway to heaven and little house on the prarie where he had creative control. little joe was the youngest, most hot headed, but the most romantic of the cartwrights. when roberts left. the show kept going with the two younger sons, but when big dan blocker left, the heart went out of bonanza. other characters had been added on by that time, david canary, tim matheson, and ben cartwright adopted young mitch vogel. but big, loyal, but a little thick hoss was easily the most lovable of the cartwrights. his sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that family. so the cartwrights of the ponderosa have passed into history. i got a real taste of how america took the cartwrights to heart when i visited the real virginia city. it doesn\\'t look anything like what you see in bonanza. but near lake tahoe, just about where you see the ponderosa on the map at the opening credits, is the cartwright home, the set maintained and open as a tourist attraction. like 21 baker street for sherlock holmes fans, the ranchhouse and the cartwrights are real. and if they weren\\'t real, they should have been. years ago, when darling lili played on tv, it was always the pan and scan version, which i hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format. so when i saw an inexpensive dvd of this julie andrews/blake edwards opus, i decided to purchase and watch it once and for all. boy, what a terrible film. it\\'s so bad and on so many levels that i really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong. looking at it now, it\\'s obvious to any fans of movies that blake edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with andrews in musicals (mary poppins, sound of music, thoroughly modern millie, etc) but also because andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by julie herself (camelot, my fair lady, etc) because hollywood thought she wasn\\'t sexy or glamorous enough. so blake created this stillborn effort, to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story/war movie/romance/slapstick comedy/musical. darling lili suffers from multiple personalities, never knowing who or what it is. some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole, it just doesn\\'t work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing. mind you, the version on the dvd is the \"director\\'s cut\", or in this case, \"let\\'s salvage whatever we can\" from this notorious box office flop. in releasing the dvd, edwards cut 19 scenes (19!!!!!!!!) from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version. the film moves along with no idea of what it is. we are 25 minutes into it and we still don\\'t know what\\'s going on or why we\\'re watching what\\'s going. what kind of spy is lili? how powerful is she? was she ever responsible for someone\\'s death? instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking julie andrews. things aren\\'t helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love. why does julie fall for hudson? why him and not other men she got involved with? there should have been one of her ex hanging around, trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret. this would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action. it would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings. there\\'s no catalyst in this story. one only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by andrews\\' (and edwards\\') previous successes. the best (or worst) example is the scene when andrews and hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest. edwards channeling sound of music. it\\'s no wonder he removed it from the dvd. back in 1970, that scene might have worked on a certain level but today, that moment reeks of desperation. there are other plot elements directly inspired by andrews/edwards other films. the endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better modern millie. the musical moment \"i\\'ll give you three guesses\" was created just to make fun of julie\\'s mary poppins persona, which is turned \"raunchy\" with julie doing a striptease in the act. the ending, bird\\'s eye view of julie running towards hudson\\'s plane, is another \"wink\" at sound of music. the whole thing is confusing. julie plays a singer, born from a german father and british mother, who lives in england but sings her (english) songs in paris. you never know exactly where the story takes place. some moments are just badly edited. like when julie and her \"uncle\" are on horseback. they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprints off in mid-sentence. i\\'m like \"what happened here?\" the comedy bits are unfunny and cringe-worthy. every scene with the french police are pathetic. where\\'s peter sellers when you really need him. the action is stupid beyond belief. when julie and her \"uncle\" are on their way to germany on that train, hudson\\'s squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train, almost killing lili in the process. brilliant. what\\'s also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning. that\\'s one slow moving train there. the musical moments. the beginning is the best part of the entire film (and the reason i gave this film 3 stars) but it\\'s effect is diminished considerably because it\\'s repeated at the end. speaking of redundant, did we really need to see a can-can dance, crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too? the \"girl in no man\\'s land\" is ok even if it\\'s bleeding obvious, but that moment just doesn\\'t make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a french hospital, making me wonder: how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying? the whole project is listless and without energy. the romance is 100% unbelievable. rock hudson is way too old and tired looking (check out the museum scene). julie looks dazed, like she\\'s on valium. but what really kills this ill-conceived project is julie playing a german spy. edwards desperately wanted to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision. as much as i like julie, she\\'s no greta garbo, who pulled it off so beautifully in mata hari. funny enough, even if julie plays a german spy, she still comes across as cloying and cute. how bad is darling lili? even after 37 years since its release, blake edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its dvd release. this series, made for televisiã³n espaã±ola (tve) is basically a series of chapters in the life of an ordinary family in 1968, primarily as seen through the eyes of the youngest son. based on a background of historical events, such as the may 1968 student uprising in france, the decaying franco regime, the war in viet-nam, the rise of imperialism, and others specifically related to spanish life at that particular moment, one might regard this series as a simple compilation of characteristic foibles which make themselves so apparent in this kind of entertainment. generally treated in a lightweight vein though not lacking in certain moments which might be called dramatic, the series would seem to be aimed at people of around fifty who can rember those times, as, it should be stated, anyone younger either chooses to ignore such happenings or is busily occupied in other things. the best thing that can be said of this series is ana duato\\'s rã´le as mother of three children: she plays the part of the total housewife of the times really well, manifesting that peculiar spanish penchant, especially noticeable among women, of letting all her thinking and her doings be carried forward by the impetus of her heart, without any resorting to the use of the brain. as we say in spain, common sense is one of the least common senses. imanol arias offers very little, apart from not being his usual stereotyped hard policeman as in other television series. indeed, as an actor, he should not be trusted in anything which is not a tv series. his resources are too limited; however, his part as father of the working-class household is not at all bad. not really recommendable for other audiences, even spanish-speakers in latin america: the themes are all too parochially related to a specific spot in contemporary spanish history, such that if the viewer was not living here at that time he will miss most of the references. it is even probable that certain situations which cause a few spanish smiles would not mean anything to other viewers. i want the 99 minutes of my life back that was wasted on this pathetic excuse for a movie. the acting was horrific! i used to be a fan of cameron diaz and vincent d\\'onofrio. i will never look at them the same again. keanu reeves and dan aykroyd were not a surprise. everyone knows they never could act. thankfully, only dan attempted an accent. his accent was a disaster as expected. i think he was either confused about the location of the film or had never actually spoken to anyone from minnesota. i hope this review helps anyone who is undecided about what to do with their precious time. the only reason i was able to sit through the whole movie was because i was stuck somewhere without anything better to watch or read. one of my favorite movies which has been overlooked by too many movie goers, an observation which mystifies me. not only directed by the acclaimed ang lee,it had many young actors who were to become major stars, e.g., tobey maguire (before spiderman), skeet ulrich (before jericho), jonathan rhys meyers (before tudors), james caviezel, simon baker, mark ruffalo, jeffrey wright, tom wilkinson, and jewel. all of the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances, especially meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killing. when the biographies and accomplishments of the director ( even when he won an academy award) and the actors are listed, this film is usually omitted from their past performances. i discovered the film on dvd by accident and it became one of my most often watched films. however, it is seldom every seen on cable. i look forward to reading what others suggest are the reasons this film is not well known. it\\'s nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead, this has solid acting from both male leads and also from the female lead and although the story is a little long and a little clichã© you cant help but like it. i think the story was a little rushed at the end, but extending that would have made the story even longer. superior to other romantic comedies such as 100 days with mr arrogant, and possibly tied with my tutor friend. it would make an interesting introduction to korean cinema, not as great as my sassy girl, but still good. of all the movies of the seventies, none captured to truest essence of the good versus evil battle as did the sentinel. i mean, yes, there were movies like the exorcist, and other ones; but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this one. if you have time, check this one out. you may not be able to get past the dated devices as such, but this is a story worth getting into.then there are all the stars and soon-to-be stars. my absolute favorites were eli wallach, sylvia miles, and burgess meredith. then there are the subtle clues that lead to what\\'s going on too. pay close attention. i had to watch it four times to catch on to all the smaller weird statements like \\'black and white cat, black and white cake\\'. plus, the books are really good as well. i\\'m just sorry that they\\'re not going to turn the second book into a film. it\\'s so scary that it would outdo this movie. this is apparently the second remake of this film, having been filmed before in 1911 and 1918. and, in so many ways it reminds me of the later film, a yank at oxford. both films concern a conceited blow-hard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both, ultimately, show the blow-hard slowly learning about teamwork and decency. in this film, william haines is \"tom brown\" and his main rival, \"bob\" is played by frances x. bushman. and, in a supporting role is jack pickford--always remembered as the brother of mary. of these three, pickford comes off the best, as the sympathetic loser who becomes tom\\'s pal--he actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the big game! all the standard clichã©s are there and the movie, because it was done so many times before and since, offers few surprises. however, it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing. in my opinion, for a better silent college film, try harold lloyd\\'s the freshman--it\\'s football scenes are frankly more exciting and harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying tom brown. the freshman is probably the best college picture you can find from the era. another reason why brown at harvard is a lesser picture is that william haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again (such as in westpoint and the smart set, among others)--and if you\\'ve seen one of these films, you\\'ve seen them all. well made, but certainly not original! and, because it is just a rehash of his other films, anyone giving the film a score of 10 is strongly advised to see these other films. 4/25/08==i just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on imdb from the 1920!! talk about over-rated! there are dozens and dozens of better films--how this film got to be #1 is anyone\\'s guess. this movie illustrates like no other the state of the australian film industry and everything that\\'s holding it back. awesome talent, outstanding performances (particularly by victoria hill), but a let down in practically every other way. an \"adaptation\" of sorts, it brought nothing new to macbeth (no, setting it in present-day australia is not enough), and essentially, completely failed to justify its existence, apart from (let\\'s face it, completely unnecessarily) paying homage to the original work. if there\\'s one body of work that has been done (and done and done and done), it\\'s shakespeare\\'s. so any adaptation, if it\\'s not to be a self-indulgent and pointless exercise, needs to at least bring some new interpretation to the work. and that\\'s what this macbeth fails to do. as it was done, this film has no contemporary relevance whatsoever. it\\'s the same piece that we have seen countless (too many!) times before. except with guns and in different outfits. apart from the fundamental blunder (no other way to put it) of keeping the original shakespearian dialogue, one of the more cringeful moments of the movie is the prolonged and incredibly boring slow motion shoot out towards the end, during which i completely tuned out, even though i was looking at the screen. i never thought i had a short attention span, but there you go. i suppose the movie succeeds on its own, very limited terms. but as australia continues to produce world-class acting talent, its movie-makers need to stop being proud of succeeding on limited terms, and actually set high enough standards to show that they respect for the kind of acting talent they work with. a shame. an absolute shame. owen loves his mamma...only he\\'d love her better six feet under in this dark, laugh-out-loud comedy that both stars and is directed by danny devito, with admirable assists from billy crystal and anne ramsey in the title role. \"throw momma from the train\" is a terrific comedy, even if it isn\\'t a great film. it\\'s too shallow in parts, and the ending feels less organic than tacked on. but it\\'s a gut-splitting ride most of the way, with crystal and devito employing great screen chemistry while working their own separate comic takes on the essence of being a struggling writer (devito is avid but untalented; crystal is blocked and bitter). crystal\\'s professor donner believes his ex-wife stole his book (the unfortunately titled \"hot fire\") and can\\'t write more than the opening line of his next book, which doesn\\'t come easy. he teaches a creative writing class of budding mediocrities, including a middle-aged woman who writes tom clancy-type fiction but doesn\\'t know what that thing is the submarine captain speaks through; and an upholstery salesman who wants to write the story of his life. mr. pinsky is probably the funniest character for laughs-per-minutes-on-screen, an ascot-wearing weirdo who sees literature as an excuse to write his opus: \"100 girls i\\'d like to pork.\" then there\\'s devito\\'s owen lift, who calls himself professor donner\\'s \"star pupil\" even though the teacher won\\'t read his work in class. owen is a somewhat unusual character to star in a movie, a man-child in his late 30s who lives with his overbearing mother, anne ramsey, who calls him \"lardass\" and other endearing sentiments. in any other movie, we\\'d be asked to feel sorry for owen, but \"throw momma from the train\" piles life\\'s cruelties onto this sad sack for laughs and expects us to go along. that\\'s one big reason why this film probably loses a lot of people. for those of us who enjoy the humor of this character, even identifying with him, and take the rest of what we see here as a lark, it\\'s not as big a stretch to go along with the bigger gambit this comedy takes, asking us to watch in amusement while owen enlists professor donner\\'s help in a plan to kill his mother. actually, he first goes to hawaii to kill donner\\'s hated ex, then tells the professor it\\'s his turn to kill mrs. lift, \"swapping murders\" as seen in hitchcock\\'s \"strangers on a train.\" as a director, devito not only complements his actors\\' performances with scene-setting that places the accent on dialogue, he makes some bold visual statements, throwing in bits of amusing unreality to keep the audience on its toes (and away from taking things too seriously.) also helping matters is writer stu silver, who keeps the laughs coming with his quotable patter. \"you got rats the size of oldsmobiles here.\" \"she\\'s not a woman...she\\'s the terminator.\" \"one little murder and i\\'m jack the ripper.\" those are all crystal\\'s words, but some of the funniest lines, which work only in context but absolutely kill, are devito\\'s and ramsey\\'s. apparently silver never wrote another screenplay after this, according to the imdb, and that\\'s a shame, because he had real talent for it. the best scene in this movie, when crystal meets ramsey, was actually used in its entirety as a theatrical \\'coming attraction\\' presentation, the only time i\\'ve seen a movie promoted that way. owen introduces the professor to his mother as \\'cousin patty,\\' and when momma says he doesn\\'t have a cousin patty, panicky owen loses it. \\'you lied to me,\\' he yells out, slamming the professor\\'s forehead with a pan. of course, in reality the professor wouldn\\'t groan out something witty from the floor, but \\'throw momma from the train\\' works effectively at such moments, when playing its looney tunes vibe for all its worth. devito hasn\\'t disappeared from films, of course, but it\\'s a mystery why he hasn\\'t really followed up on the directorial promise of this movie. maybe it\\'s because, as \\'throw momma from the train\\'s lack of mainstream success shows, his kind of vision isn\\'t to everyone\\'s tastes. that\\'s too bad for those of us who can watch this over and over, and like it. a compelling thriller!!, 10 december 2005

invigorating as the malevolent psychos.capeshaw is okay.ruby dee is great as the tenacious grandmother.the rest of the cast is wonderful as well. filmfour are going to have to do a lot better than this little snot of a film if they\\'re going to get the right sort of reputation for themselves. this film is set in glasgow (although only a couple of secondary characters have anything approaching a scottish accent). the premise, about people who\\'s lives are going nowhere, who all meet up in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning as they have night jobs, could have made for a really funny, insightful, quirky, cultish film. instead we have a group of self-obsessed saddos and a plot which has been so done to bits i\\'m suprised it hasn\\'t been banned. x and y are friends. x is sleeping with z. y sleeps with z as well. oh you figure it out. a total waste of time. painful dialogue - it sounded like something that a group of 16 year olds would have written for a gcse drama project. the female character was completely superfluous - just written in as a token female in the hope that women would be cajoled into seeing it. if you\\'re the sort of thicko lad who laughs at beer adverts and can usually be found wandering round in packs shouting on saturday nights in nondescript town centres then you will love this film and find it \"a right laff\". everyone else, run, don\\'t walk away from this sorry little misfit. and one question, when the group left the \"boring\" seaside town (saltcoats incidentally although they changed the name on the film), to go back to glasgow, why did they do it via the forton motorway services at lancaster which is in england? doctor mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar, but is totally worthwhile. it really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s. which is why i\\'d have loved to see follow-up movies... but judging by the rest of full moon\\'s output there simply weren\\'t enough tits to satisfy the typical audience. unfortunately, thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience - which is unfortunate, because without em\\' this could have been a harry potter-style magicfest that kids would have eaten up. both jeffrey combs and yvette nipar are great - i wasn\\'t sure if ms. nipar hadn\\'t wandered off an a-list picture onto this film, she was very believable. no, seriously! anyway - it\\'s a shame they didn\\'t have the bucks to license dr. strange, because i think this could have been a total kiddie phenom. a truly muddled incomprehensible mess. most things in the film look more or less like 1987, but then there are futuristic things just thrown in, like the policeman\\'s ray gun. and that car! the director seemed to be in love with colored lights. the only really notable performance was the girl who played valerie, but since there was no cast listing, i don\\'t know which actress that was. this one is worth missing. grade: f it doesn\\'t happen very often, but occasionally one man can make a difference -- a big difference. george crile\\'s 2003 best seller, charlie wilson\\'s war, is a fascinating and eye-opening account of the most unlikely \"difference maker\" imaginable. a relatively obscure congressman from the second district of texas, \"good time charlie\" was known more for his libertine lifestyle than his libertarian legislation. likable and licentious (even for a politician), charlie wilson served his constituency well since the good folks of lufkin only really wanted two things, their guns and to be left alone. it\\'s easy street replete with his bevy of beltway beauties known, appropriately enough, as charlie\\'s angels. when asked why his entire office staff was composed of attractive, young aides his response is a classic, \"you can teach \\'em to type, but you can\\'t teach \\'em to grow tits.\" no argument there. but even the most rakish rapscallion has a conscience lurking somewhere underneath, and for charlie wilson the unimaginable atrocities being committed in afghanistan moved him to muster his entire political savvy toward funding the utter, humiliating defeat of the russian military and, possibly, to even help hasten the end of the cold war as a result. fat chance, huh? under the skillful direction of mike nichols and a smart, snappy screenplay by adam sorkin, charlie wilson\\'s war is a sparkling, sophisticated satire that chronicles the behind-the- scene machinations of three colorful characters comprising \"charlie\\'s team.\" the on-screen \"team,\" is composed of three marvelous actors with four (4) academy awards and nine (9) nominations between them. charlie is beautifully portrayed by tom hanks in a solid, slightly understated fashion that is among his best work in years. he\\'s aided, abetted and abedded by joanne herring, a wealthy houston socialite played by the still-slinky julia roberts. hey, why else have the bikini scene than to let the world know this? by all accounts ms. roberts looks good and holds her own, but the screenplay never gives us even a hint why kabul and country is so important to her character. maybe the two afghan hounds usually by her side know -- but we as an audience never do. as for the third member of the \"team,\" philip seymour hoffman steals every scene he appears in as gust aurakotos, a smart, street- wise (i.e. non ivy league graduate) cia malcontent who knows the score -- both in the agency\\'s boardroom and in wilson\\'s bedroom. for the mujahideen to succeed, the most important assistance the u.s. can provide is the ability to shoot down the dreaded mi-21 helicopter gunships which rule the skies. this takes money, lots of money, and eventually \"charlie\\'s team\" covertly coerces those in congress to fund the effort to the tune of $1 billion dollars for advanced weaponry to arm the afghan rebels. this includes top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art anti-aircraft and anti-tank rockets as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices. nasty, nasty stuff. that this kind of multi-billion dollar illicit activity can and does take place behind congressional doors is truly alarming. every american should see this movie or read this book because it reveals a truly frightening aspect of the business-as-usual political scene rarely seen outside the walls of our very own government. oh momma, i wish it weren\\'t so... even though the initial outcome for \"team charlie\" was an unqualified success, the unimaginable, unanticipated final result is that these sophisticated weapons are now used against our troops by the taliban and others. since the funding was entirely \"covert,\" the young generation in this part of the world has no idea the fall of soviet oppression and the end to russian barbarity was the direct result of american intervention. yes, once the russkies left, so did our aid -- zip for schools, zip for infrastructure, zip on maintaining meaningful relationships with the afghan people. as a result, the overall consequence is an unmitigated disaster -- it\\'s like the forerunner to \"mission accomplished.\" as nichol\\'s film so pointedly points out, \"the ball you\\'ve set in motion can keep bouncing even after you\\'ve lost interest in it.\" mike krzyzewski knows this, eva longoria parker knows this, little lateesha in lafayette knows this, but the typical american politician doesn\\'t. so we go from good guys to bad guys because we couldn\\'t let the world know we were the good guys. talk about a catch-22 (another mike nichols film). perhaps charlie wilson said it best, \"we f&%ked up the end game.\" again. i\\'m a big fan of surrealist art, but this film by bunuel (with some ideas from dali) left me cold. bunuel had a life-long grudge against the catholic church and delighted in trying to offend catholics in fairly silly ways. this is one of the silliest; almost like what you\\'d expect from a smart-aleck 18-year-old in film class. the last few minutes of the movie, which have nothing to do with anything else, are a final nose-thumbing at religion. if you read the \"scholars\" regarding this slow-paced, occasionally amusing film, it\\'s all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression. if that is indeed the point, then bunuel expresses it in the most roundabout fashion possible. the central male character is a nasty brute who loves kicking dogs and knocking blind men down in the street, and who mentally turns billboard ads into strange sexual fantasies. is this behavior the church\\'s fault (for interrupting his lovemaking), or is he just a jerk? i vote for the latter. i think bunuel must have had a lot of personal hangups and chose the catholics as the ones to blame. there are a few moments where you might cry, \"aha! surrealism!\": a cow in a bed, a giraffe falling out a window (a poor model), a man shredding a feather pillow, a woman flushing a toilet while we watch pictures of seething lava (or a mud pit...hard to tell in b/w). the rest is forgettable self-indulgence. unfortunately, bunuel was still chasing the same bogey-men through the rest of his career (viridiana, discreet charm...). if you\\'re interested in seeing surrealism on the screen, check out jean cocteau\\'s early work. this ludicrous film offers the standard 1970\\'s \"hippie mentality\" in a nut shell and bores us in the process. its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young, innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups. a naive young hippy played by the waif-like ( kay lenz ) hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys, and then one day she meets the ridiculous (holden), already in old age, hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor, and she decides that she is in \"love\" with him. if you think that is superficial, the whole film encapsulates such scenes. she keeps saying how much she \"loves\" him and she only met him, it wears thin and really quick. i couldn\\'t help but laugh throughout the film. its obvious she\\'s just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place. a disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex, i had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit. a corny offering of music from the 70\\'s is also spread through the film. avoid this if you can. grade d. this film was pretty good. i am not too big a fan of baseball, but this is a movie that was made to help understand the meaning of love, determination, heart, etc. danny glover, joseph gordon-levitt, brenda fricker, christopher lloyd, tony danza, and milton davis jr. are brought in with a variety of talented actors and understanding of the sport. the plot was believable, and i love the message. william dear and the guys put together a great movie. most sports films revolve around true stories or events, and they often do not work well. but this film hits a 10 on the perfectness scale, even though there were a few minor mistakes here and there. 10/10 for his first ever debut this film has some riveting and chilling moments. in the best horror film fashion the pit of your stomach tightens every moment during this film. the ending is superb. the makers of blaire witch obviously watched this film it\\'s ending wasn\\'t an end but a beginning of the end. a great movie and only a piece of japan\\'s great as far as scare factor a perfect score it makes you think and scared out of your mind. this film contain far too much meaningless violence. too much shooting and blood. the acting seems very unrealistic and is generally poor. the only reason to see this film is if you like very old cars. pathetic attempt to use science to justify new age religion/philosophy. the two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about quantum physics in this mess is just plain wrong. examples? quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern religions that reality is an illusion. how? well, in the world of the subatomic, you can never definitely predict a particles location at a specific time. you can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time. also, the act of observation seems to affect the event. solid particles can pass through barriers. all of this, so far, is accurate. but then they assert that that means that if you believed sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall, you could indeed do it. this is complete poppycock. instead, the theory asserts that at our level, it is possible for you to walk through a wall, but it is merely by chance and has nothing to do with belief. also you\\'d have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remotest chance of passing through the wall, the odds are so astronomically against it. this is but one example of how they misrepresent the science. but much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer, played by marlee maitlan. about halfway through the picture it becomes so confused as to be incomprehensible. something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and self-hate. there may be some truth to that, but quantum physics has nothing to do with it. plus, string theory is the hot new thing in physics nowadays. instead of wasting your time with this dreck, i suggest you rent the elegant universe, an amazing series done for nova on pbs that gives you a history of physics from newton and gravity to ed witten and m theory in only 3 hour-long episodes. quantum mechanics is explained there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation. i was truly looking forward to this title. it sounded and looked fun. the idea of someone making a cheesy 50s monster movie could have been worth a few laughs, but instead this title only bores. first off, there is almost no froggg in the entire movie which is the biggest disappointment. i have to sit through 75+ minutes of lame drama and dialog to get a few glimpses of the froggg humping a bare breasted chick. why? on top of that the film lacks any sort of fun plot. i mean give me something thats a bit more interesting than just a bunch of talking heads. i wanted to see some hot chicks search for the creature in the swamp, i wanted to see some cuties dragged off to his lair in desperate need of rescue (creature from the black lagoon stuff), i wanted to see a few goofy action scenes of the froggg going on a killing spree, or it maybe escaping a silly trap. something exciting! geez, have fun with it, be creative! who wants to sit through endless and tiring dialog scenes in a creature flick? my advice to the filmmakers: keep going, your concepts are good, but your execution needs to be a lot more inspired. have some fun with the creature, put the humor in the action and most important...put more creature in a creature movie!!! one of my sisters friends lent me this game, and it is too damn hard! it carries the appearance of a kids game, but you have to learn how to do tons of intricate moves that require you to twist and turn your hands into all sorts of awkward positions, and you have to search seemingly endless levels for 100 notes, to improve your \\'score\\'! you also have to find these impossibly hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces, that require you to do almost impossible tasks to get them! and i am only up to stage three!!!!! maybe if you have no life nad can stay home all the time you might get some enjoyment out of this, but otherwise keep away! and it is definately not recommended for kids - they will pull their hair out within the hour! chuck jones\\'s \\'rabbit seasoning\\', the second in the much beloved hunting trilogy, is often considered to be the best of the three. while i find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoons, i would have to concede that \\'rabbit seasoning\\' is the most finely honed script. here, the emphasis is placed on language as bugs and daffy run through a series of complex dialogues in the grand tradition of abbot and costello\\'s \\'who\\'s on next\\' routine. as a long term daffy fan, i have always been delighted by the hunting trilogy because it is consistently daffy who gets all the best lines (the famous \"pronoun trouble\" being one of the all time classics) and does most of the work. bugs plays the role of cool manipulator while elmer, as always, is the befuddled dupe. part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that daffy and elmer pose so little threat to bugs that he is basically just kicking back and having some easy laughs. elmer falls into every trap that is laid for him but it is poor old daffy who comes off worst, being shot in the face again and again, his beak ending up in more and more ridiculous positions. it all builds to the inevitable climactic declaration \"you\\'re despicable\". as intricate an example of chuck jones\\'s impeccable timing as you\\'ll come across, \\'rabbit seasoning\\' is a true classic. a lovely little b picture with all the usual joe lewis touches.... people ripping up pillows and auras of lurking fear. also, alas, an ending that comes out of nowhere, because, apparently, the auteur has lost interest in the movie, or perhaps because as a b picture it has to fit into a slot. \"crossfire\" is a justifiably famous 1947 noir that\\'s a murder mystery with a strong message. it stars robert young, robert mitchum, robert ryan, sam levene, and gloria grahame, and is strongly directed by edward dmytryk. we witness the murder in shadow at the beginning, and for the rest of the film, young, as the detective, finlay, in charge of the case, seeks to figure out which of three soldiers is responsible for the death, and just as important, why. the victim, joseph samuels (sam levene) is someone the soldiers meet in a bar; they go up to his apartment to continue their visit, and samuels winds up dead. i don\\'t know about 1947, but seeing \"crossfire\" today, one knows who did it and why the minute we see the suspects. i don\\'t suppose it was so apparent back then, as these actors were just getting started. nevertheless, the film packs a big punch with its powerful acting, good direction, violence, and unsparing anti-semite language. the characterizations are vivid, including that of gloria grahame in a smallish role - she\\'s a woman who meets mitchell (george cooper), one of the suspect soldiers, in a bar and can provide him with an alibi. the big performance in the film belongs to robert ryan, but everyone is excellent. robert young especially is effective as a tough but intelligent police detective. mitchum is very likable as a soldier trying to help his confused friend mitchell, a lonely man unsure if he still has feelings for his wife. truly excellent, and a must see. awwww, i just love this movie to bits. me and my cousins enjoy this movie a lot and i am just such a huge fan!!! i hope they bring the tv series out on dvd soon. come to mention it, i have not see the tv show in a long time. such geart times! where i come from australia the chipmunk adventure is only known by people in their late teens and adult years which is kinda sad because the young kids don\\'t know what there missing. the songs in this film are ace the ones i love the most boys/girls of rock n\\'roll, diamond dolls and the song that ls sure to make you want to cry my mother. this film is sure to excite both young and old get the chipmunk adventure today!!! 10 out of 10, such an excellent movie. skippy from \"family ties\" plays eddie, a wussy \\'metal\\' nerd who gets picked on. when his favorite wussy \\'metal\\' singer, sammi curr, dies, he throws a hissy fit tearing down all the posters on his bedroom wall. but when he later gets an unreleased record that holds the spirit of his dead \\'metal\\' idol. he first gets sucked into ideas of revenge, but then he doesn\\'t want to take it as far as sammi does. which isn\\'t really that far as his main victims only seem to go to the hospital. this movie is utterly laughable and has about as much to do with real metal as say, \"rock star\". ok, maybe a tad more than that piece of junk, but you get my point. and how anyone can root for a guy played by skippy from \"family ties\" i haven\\'t a clue. the cameo by gene simmons is ok, and ozzy osbourne reaches coherency, i applaud him for that, but otherwise skip this one. my grade: d eye candy:elise richards gets topless, an a topless extra at a pool party of course i would have to give this film 10 out of 10 as my uncle was the main screenplay writer of once upon a crime. rodolfo sonego wrote screenplays for over 50 years living in italy. he was a great story teller and someone suggested that he put his stories into writing. so rodolfo sonego did. if you check out his biography, you can see the number of movies that have been made in italy. alberto sordie was the main actor that starred in his stories. my uncle visited australia and my town, in 1968 to check out locations for \"a girl in australia\" and created a great movie about a proxy bride after the second world war. you can see his humor in all his movies. i found a copy of this movie on dvd recently. great goldeneye will always go down as one of thee most legendary games in vg history. their is no doubt about that. but this game, although quite different, could quite possibly be the modern-day bond champ, of its time. this was not a bond game based on material from another medium. this was a completely new; scripted game. which even had its own theme song! (wouldnt be bond without it, haha!) gameplay was excellent, and if you\\'re a fan of the bond games or films alike, you\\'ll enjoy it. unlike some/most games, these cast members portrayed their characters themselves, as opposed to fictional creations for the game. which gives it that more cinematic feel. with a very \\'bond\\'-able storyline, you feel like you\\'re in the game as much as you get lost in a movie. enjoyable in all aspects, from start to finish. even after beating the game there\\'s still plenty more to be done. with the ranking system and unlockables to be achieved, as well as its multi-player missions, this is a stand-out game. despite being quite old now, in video game years. it\\'s still a good game that you can pick up & play whenever you feel the need to get a little more bond in your life. even now just thinking about it, i\\'ve got the theme song stuck in my head. such a great cast and well-written storyline. the story comes to life on the screen, almost as if the actors were their in front of you, and is every bit as entertaining as the game itself. superbly done, in true bond fashion. which can only be named awesome, completely awesome. i\\'ve gotta go throw this game on now. if you haven\\'t played it yet, you\\'re missing out! helena bonham carter is the center of this movie. she plays her role almost immobile in a wheelchair but still brings across her traditional intensity. kenneth branagh was tolerable. the movie itself was good not exceptional. if you are a helena bonham carter fan it is worth seeing. i commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a \"thumbs in the middle\" review, remarking that i\\'d give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode. i\\'ve seen a total of six episodes now up to this point in june 2006. and as a lifelong batman fanatic, i can say without hesitation: this show is utter crap. everything\\'s wrong with it. everything. getting past just the lousy animation and design, the stories are ridiculously convoluted and with no character development or apparent interest by the writers of this dreck to give any substance to any stories. and for god\\'s sake...is it just me, or is the joker in every episode?? is gotham that much of a revolving-door justice system? or, again, is it just a complete lack of interest in the writers to put any effort into other villains (see \"no character development\", above). and to make matters worse, every single joker tale is the same 3-part formula. 1) joker gasses people. 2) joker sets out to gas the whole city. 3) batman saves the day. pfeh. there was one episode i saw that wasn\\'t a joker story. the title escapes me, but the villain was that nefarious cluemaster...the \"think thank thunk\" episode with the quiz show. that was the single-worst batman story i\\'ve ever seen, heard or read. yes, worse than \"i\\'ve got batman in my basement.\" i can\\'t really say what i feel this show is because it\\'s probably against the tos, but it starts with \"b\" and rhymes with \"fastardization\". thank goodness for the existence of the timm/dini/etc. era of bat-entertainment, back from the fox and kids wb days. stuff that good, and i should have known this, just couldn\\'t possibly have lasted forever, unfortunately. just because someone is under the age of 10 does not mean they are stupid. if your child likes this film you\\'d better have him/her tested. i am continually amazed at how so many people can be involved in something that turns out so bad. this \"film\" is a showcase for digital wizardry and nothing else. the writing is horrid. i can\\'t remember when i\\'ve heard such bad dialogue. the songs are beyond wretched. the acting is sub-par but then the actors were not given much. who decided to employ joey fatone? he cannot sing and he is ugly as sin. the worst thing is the obviousness of it all. it is as if the writers went out of their way to make it all as stupid as possible. great children\\'s movies are wicked, smart and full of wit - films like shrek and toy story in recent years, willie wonka and the witches to mention two of the past. but in the continual dumbing-down of american more are flocking to dreck like finding nemo (yes, that\\'s right), the recent charlie & the chocolate factory and eye-crossing trash like red riding hood. \"hey babu riba\" is a film about a young woman, mariana (nicknamed \"esther\" after a famous american movie star), and four young men, glenn, sacha, kicha, and pop, all perhaps 15-17 years old in 1953 belgrade, yugoslavia. the five are committed friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans, or anything american it seems. the very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant, and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties. in the wake of changing communist politics, they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 (the year before the film was made). i enjoyed the film with some reservations. the subtitles for one thing were difficult. especially in the beginning, there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all. perhaps the conversational pace required it, but i couldn\\'t always both read the text and absorb the scene, which caused me to not always understand which character was involved. i watched the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative. this yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers\\' sense of invulnerability, idealism, and strong and loyal bonds to each other. there is a main flashforward, and it was intriguing, keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were vis-a-vis the 1953 cast, and what had actually happened. i would rate it 7 out of 10, and would like to see other films by the director, jovan acin (1941-1991). after a snowstorm, the roads are blocked and the highway patrolman jason (adam beach) comes to the diner of his friend fritz (jurgen prochnow) and advises his clients that they will only be able to follow their trips on the next day. among the weird strangers, jason meets his former sweetheart nancy (rose mcgowan), who has just left her husband in los angeles. along the night, without any communication with his base, jason faces distressful and suspicious situations with the clients, and finds some corpses, indicating that among them there is a killer. \"the last stop\" could be an average thriller, but the screenplay is simply awful. most of the characters are despicable persons and the motives of the surprising serial killer are never disclosed, and the viewers have no further explanation why the killer decided to kill the guests. my vote is four. title (brazil): \"encurralados\" (\"trapped\") this movie was a fairly entertaining comedy about murphy\\'s law being applied to home ownership and construction. if a film like this was being made today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional. since it was set in the \\'simpler\\' forties, we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the era. grant of course perfectly blends the comedic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent supporting cast highlighted by loy and douglas. their shenanigans make for a solid ninety minutes of entertainment, 7/10. what can you say about the film white fire. amazing? fantastic? disturbing? hilarious? these words are not big enough to describe the event which is white fire. from wobbly, garbled beginning to profound end, this movie will entertain throughout. our movie begins in the woods of a country somewhere in the world. a family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms. when the father separates from the mother and their childen, you get a real sense of what kind of movie you\\'re about to watch. father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit, and is polite as he gets people\\'s attention before he shoots them, but alas, dad is burned alive in what looks like a very unsupervised, unsafe stunt. meanwhile, mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about 5 feet behind them. he too gives a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre \"halt!\", and then promptly wastes the mother. this action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes bo and ingred. so now we fast forward about 20 years (30 if you\\'re honest about the hero\\'s age) to beautiful turkey, where bo and ingred have settled as professional thieves, or diamond prospectors, or something. ingred works at a diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods, while bo (masterfully played by the dynamic robert ginty) drives around the desert in his denim outfits. bo and ingrid have an interesting relationship. they don\\'t seem to have any friends other than each other, and they spend all of their time together. that coupled with the fact that bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as \"you know its a shame you\\'re my sister\" he says to her while she\\'s stark naked, make for a very dynamic duo. bo is then crushed when ingrid is killed, as he wanders the beaches of turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf. a renewal of hope occurs when bo finds a girl who looks like ingrid, and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like ingrid. this opens the door for bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong. bo is a real fan of ethical grey areas, and he is overjoyed with his new love. so anyway, there\\'s a lot of fun action scenes, ridiculous violence, great acting, impossible to follow plot-lines, fred \"the hammer\" williamson (for some reason), and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond (which later explodes). all of these things are great, but the bo and ingrid relationship is what makes this movie special....really special. so i heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is white fire. you may be glad you did..or not. i am so disappointed. this movie left me feeling jipped out of my time and mental energy. here was the quintessential woody allen film all over again: the neurotic upper-class manhattanites debating whether or not they will cheat on their spouses. woody, i\\'ve seen these characters already, i\\'ve seen the storyline from you ten times already. where did your creativity go??? you need to open your eyes and look around you. the world has changed dramatically since annie hall - and you need to change along with it. there are far more interesting and funny scenarios to which you can apply your brand of angst and neuroticism - why not try them out instead of rehashing the same old slop over and over and over again. when i hear that woody allen has a new project coming out, it does nothing for me - because now i\\'ve come to expect his old standby: the couple who are growing tired of each other and end up cheating. depressing and same old, same old. if woody wants to win his fans back, then he has to understand that our sense of humor and intelligence has to be stimulated - not insulted. this movie is all ultra-lightweight fluff, predictable from beginning to end. as a don knotts vehicle, \"the incredible mr. limpet\" was much better, with knott\\'s character there not nearly as incompetent or ignorant. his performance there was toned down, with none of his trademark goggle-eyed stare, although that may have something to do with him being replaced for most of the movie by a cartoon fish. knotts made a living of playing the likable imbecile, much as bob denver did. neither really seemed to be able to break out to other types of roles, assuming they were simply typecast. it was probably because of the slouch, the wild stare and the high-pitched voice. john ritter, whom knotts worked with in \"three\\'s company,\" was able to transcend his genre, branching out successfully into dramatic roles like \"the dreamer of oz,\" but the closest knotts ever got was a small role in \"pleasantville.\" even leslie nielsen was a bad fit here, uncomfortably neither straight dramatic actor as he was at the time nor deadpan comedic actor as he later became in \"airplane!\" and \"police squad.\" there\\'s also no way the then-43 year-old knotts could pass for a 35 year-old, as his character insisted he was. it was as ludicrously unbelievable as tom hanks at 38 playing the college-age forrest gump. the film was clearly made on a shoestring budget, very much looking like a hastily-filmed tv episode. it\\'s especially evident in the \"exterior\" scenes of the \"town\" where roy goes after he\\'s fired. it\\'s unlikely even a pre-schooler would be fooled by the mayberry-like soundstage artificiality. even viewing this strictly as a children\\'s movie, it\\'s very disappointing. it\\'s not because it lacks action or special effects, although it does. the pace is much too slow, the situations repetitive. how many times can you watch roy getting onto a bus? a comedy for kids should at least sometimes be madcap, with breakneck gags, otherwise you risk boring them (and any adults in the theater as well). movies, even kid\\'s movies, have improved quite a bit in the intervening decades. even many contemporary comedies were better filmed and written. disney\\'s \"the love bug,\" for instance, at least had some interesting race action. if you are interested in learning more about this sort of thing happening in modern civilization, there is an excellent book called \"outlaw seas\" or \"the outlaw sea\", and it describes, in story after story, how these things do happen. the lawlessness of the high seas is a reality for a number of reasons. one, many of the world\\'s freighters are of questionable registry (nationality) and it\\'s difficult to impossible to enforce international laws when the ships owners don\\'t have an office in a real country. two, many ship lines employ crews from dirt poor third world countries. the crews are often (like illegal immigrant workers) threatened and bullied into complying with questionable or illegal practices. three, there is often a language barrier, not only between the officers and the crew, but also between the crew members themselves. the crew are rewarded for their compliance and their silence. four, once committing an illegal act, the ships are able to hide in plain sight with little more than a fresh coat of paint. anyway, it\\'s fascinating reading. horrifying story, excellent movie. does anyone else notice how hbo seems to make the best and most important movies? hollywood has trouble releasing enough oscar worthy movies in any given year, so that several of the top 5 contenders usually come from britain. jerry bruckheimer = the end of quality cinema. i loved the thoroughly evil performance by sean pertwee. i also, as usual, loved omar epps. gamers: dr is not a fancy made movie, it\\'s more like amateur video. horrible magic effect, really fake fireball, terribly made dungeon, castle, village...... sword, axe, shield, robe, plate..... okok... everything. you will need about 10 minutes to adjust your expecting on visual, then you will get 105 minutes of fun. i\\'m from hongkong and it\\'s really hard to find rpers, none of my friends play rpg and i always fancy to be one of the character in the world of d&d. watching gamers: dr just show me what would it be like to be a gamer. you see rule books, dices, game set, etc etc etc; you hear terms like \"fighter\", \"wizard\", \"hit point\", \"level\", \"character\", \"flaming hand\", \"chaotic evil\". what rpg fancy me is that it let you do anything u want to, not bonded by software rpg. gamers: dr provide the same element, you wont know what happen next and it probably just make you laugh to dead. the movie goes both gamers\\'s real life as well as in the d&d world. you will hear the gamer cast the dice when the character in game take action, which make you feel you really participle in the game. i don\\'t want to spoil anything, but in short, gamers: dr is a must watch movie for rpg lovers. for people never play rpg game, i\\'m sure you still get many fun from it. in all honesty, i haven\\'t seen this film for many years, but the few times i have tend to make parts of it stick in my memory, as anyone who has seen it will understand. i first saw it as a child at a ymca halloween party in the early sixties, and it scared the hell out of us kids, in a fun way. i remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze. i can\\'t risk giving away the ending, except to say that it was surprising, to say the least. i remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out a big scared holler, followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed. the ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes to a movie in film history, and yet oddly moving, in a way. you have to see it for yourself, which is not easy these days. i don\\'t know if it\\'s available on home video or not, but it would still make a great halloween feature for both kids and adults. this is the only thing i will be able to look back on from the year 2006 and say now that rocked. it rocked hard, and yet it also rocked tasty. mr.meatloaf added a nice little touch to this dish of a film before the opening credits even rolled. now that tells you something, this filmed rocked even before it started! now i don\\'t want to give to much away or be a \"spoiler\" but this movie rocked! if you have heard the new album and thought to yourself \"this seems a bit substandard tenacious material,it is like i a merely playing badminton with satan, what gives?\" then this movie will elevate your appreciation for the music and you will marvel at this steamy satanic masterpiece. for those who would want it better do not know what they want,because better would no longer be the d. this movie is the d period.!so venture if you dare to the local viewing theater if you to want to have your socks rocked. you\\'d think you\\'re in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel 3000 miles or so from france to saudi arabia, going through most of europe - italy, bulgaria, croatia, slovenia, turkey, before arriving in the middle east. but this is not a tour, and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sights. reda\\'s father is in his twilight years, and wishes to do the haj. however, since walking and taking the mule is out of the question, he chooses to travel to mecca by car. he can\\'t drive, and therefore enlists the help of reda, to his son\\'s protest, to get him there in their broken down vehicle. but reda doesn\\'t see the point of having him go along, when his dad could opt for the plane. he resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldn\\'t understand. and hence, we set off in this arduous journey with father and son, being not the best of pals. the beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair, the challenges they face, the weird people they meet, having to duke it out in varied weather conditions, and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car. we see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other, the father trying to impose on his son, and the son trying to assert himself as an adult, but circumstances we see, reveal that reda is quite a fish out of water. through the many encounters, they actually team up quite well despite their differences. it\\'s perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with hari raya haji, and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their haj. the final scene in mecca is truly a sight to behold, and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating. the sights of europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon, so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination. it certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are. don\\'t miss this, and yes, book early - i was pleasantly surprised that this evening\\'s session was still a full house. i watched this movie based on the good reviews here, and i won\\'t make that mistake again. the first couple minutes shows that a group of people have been brought together by some tragedy, but you don\\'t see what it is. flashback 12-hours and we get to see the boring lives of each of these people, which in the end are totally meaningless to what is about to happen. when the ending is finally reveled, you realize that you just wasted an hour of your life waiting for a big payoff that doesn\\'t happen and means nothing to what you have been watching. the only connection these people have is that they have all had a \"bad day\"--but even that continuity gets lost in the boredom. if this was supposed to be a \"crash\" clone, it\\'s a complete failure. a great bugs bunny cartoon from the earlier years has bugs as a performer in an window display at a local department store. after he\\'s done for the day the manager comes in to tell him that he\\'ll be transferring soon. bugs is happy to oblige into he figures out that the new job is in taxidermy...and that taxidermy has to do with stuffing animals. animals like say, a certain rabbit. this causes a battle of wits between the rascally rabbit and his now former employer. i found this short to be delightful and definitely one of the better ones of the early 1940\\'s. it still remains as funny nearly 60+ years later. this animated short can be seen on disc 1 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 2. my grade: a- i firmly believe that the best oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons: 1 ) host steve martin was at his most wittiest: \" i saw the teamsters help michael moore into the trunk of his limo \" and \" i\\'ll better not mention the gay mafia in case i wake up with a poodle\\'s head in my bed \" 2 ) surprise winners: no one had adrien brody down for best actor ( genuine applause ) or roman polanski for best director ( genuine jeers and boos ) but they won last year\\'s award ceremony wasn\\'t too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and i was happy to see return of the king sweep the awards even if it wasn\\'t the best in the trilogy ( fellowship was much better )but what let the bbc coverage down was jonathan ross getting a few of his sycophantic mates round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but . so when i heard sky were doing the coverage for british tv i was expecting barry norman and mark kermode to be doing the links , but instead we ended up with jamie theakston and sharon osbourne ! oh gawd if british tv are desperate for film critics ( obviously they are ) i\\'m sure both bob the moo and theo robertson will happily fly over to la to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers chris rock wasn\\'t too bad , but he\\'s no steve martin while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats put in ! not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion . the main problem i had with the ceremony was the format with the \" minor \" oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats ! there\\'s no such thing as a \" minor \" oscar and just because the award is for best animated short or best costume design they\\'re as well deserved as best picture or best director . all the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium . what a bunch of arrogant snobs the academy are becoming and i quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it wasn\\'t for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history . as for the awards themselves best supporting actress - cate blanchett . no great surprise for a competitive category best supporting actor - morgan freeman . no real complaints since freeman is one of america\\'s greatest living character actors best actor - jamie foxx . most predictable award of the night . yawn best actress - hilary swank . major surprise since everyone thought annette benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night best director - clint eastwood . major surprise since everyone thought scorsese was going to get the award simply because he\\'d never won one . actually i\\'m glad about this because if he didn\\'t deserve it for taxi driver , raging bull or goodfellas he didn\\'t deserve it for the aviator best film - million dollar baby . again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while i thought the hollywood friendly plot of the aviator would have made it a dead cert for best picture while mdb\\'s controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off what these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they haven\\'t done in the past , i mean a beautiful mind beating the fellowship of the ring for gawd\\'s sake ! and long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts while in a plane, flicking through the large choice of movies, i came across live! almost accidentally. oh boy! what a choice. i remembered vaguely seeing the trailer over a year ago and completely forgot about it expecting no more than another cheesy nonsense movie about a stupid reality show. now i can easily say this has been a hell of a ride. i don\\'t remember last time i have been so excited, terrified. not sure if it was the high altitude playing with my senses, but the suspense grow gradually through the movie until reaching a climax where you can\\'t turn away from the screen, literally sitting on the edge of your seat and biting the remaining nails you\\'ve got. you will first go through a personal moral assessment of where you stand about the righteousness of the show. you will drift from thinking \"how come the human being can be so vicious\" to \"why not after all?\".ask yourself would you do it. then learn about the contestants, their motives and start guessing. you will then watch contestant pulling the trigger one by one and get excited even though you know the first candidate is safe. good acting, good directing, with a movie experience that reminds you those old movies where you knew what would happen in the next scene but still were craving for more. *spoilers* couple of things i would have changed: - the casting of the contestants. i have really been moved by the farmer and we should have had a bit more like him. the idea of a rich writer who wants to be famous is a bit stupid, it felt like you didn\\'t care about some of the contestants. although this might have been done on purpose, i think the audience should have been able to associate with the majority of the contestants. - game rules, a big glitch : what happens if the 5th contestants doesn\\'t die when he pulls the trigger. do you seriously think the last standing guy will pull the trigger and execute himself!!! they should have given a chance to all contestants to live, ie: if 5th is a blank too, then no one dies. interestingly i haven\\'t been bothered too much by this bad points cause i really had a good time. just wish i had some popcorn with me! ah, another movie with motorcycles, hell\\'s angels posse and steve a-lame-o as the not-so-cool car driver. this movie does not rely on story but lots of drinking, pot smoking, and lots of moronic acts. steve\\'s rendition of a dying cat during his \"i love what i know\" serenade had me vomiting for hours. bike chick linda (rrrr) makes out with everyone! fats did the best acting since he just grunts and makes sounds. i also dare you to try to make out what banjo is saying. \"you messin\\' wit private stock.\" this is scriptwriting folks. i liked the ending. what better place to have the climax than a lighthouse! you have to see this to detest it. die jeter, die!!! a rating of \"1\" does not begin to express how dull, depressing and relentlessly bad this movie is. i feel dumber after watching the first 20 min,luckily i walked out and saved the rest of my brain, people should watch better films and take notes on why they are rated highly,not because of the budget of the film or the special effects, just simply good acting and getting simple things right,and most importantly--not being lame--, but i guess this was produced for those sheeple without taste and not a clue of what is \\'\\'a good movie\\'\\'don\\'t be scared of rating films low,save your under-appreciated high scores for \\'\\'once in a life time movies\\'\\'. keep in mind that many use imdb for trusted reviews and opinions,don\\'t spoil the broth by sugarcoating turds peace & love the most self-indulgent movie i have every had the misfortune to rent. unwatchable. much of the movie is obviously improvised, and not well. it looks like toback took the first take of everything. the movie gets good for a couple of minutes when robert downey jr. shows up, then goes to hell again real quickly. this has got to be the worst movie i haver ever seen nielson in. this movie just does not have what he needs to be funny. i think the reasons that the naked gun and the like movies is that they did not require nielson to be funny. he just played the roles as straight as he could while all of the comedy that went on was mostly visual. but when you put him in a movie where he has to be funny, he isn\\'t. the movie had only one good part, and this may be considered a spoiler by some, and that the beginning credits were animated. if the whole movie had been animated, it might have been good. i had no intention of seeing this movie when i saw the ads for it, and the only reason i did see it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won them in a radio contest. this is the first and probably only movie i have ever walked out on. on a scale of 1-10 i give this movie a score of -100. i like ghost stories. good ghost stories of bumps in the night, voices that cannot be explained. now i\\'ve see many of them. as special efx have a ever more grip on todays films, some times to find a real gem , you gotta turn the clock back to the time when the writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories. now this one, very rare , pilot episode for the tv series ghost story called \" the new house \" was one of the most scariest films i ever saw. it was on once in 1972,...i was only 9,..but nothing since then even compared to it. with all the remake going on in hollywood, some one should do this one \" as is \" with no more special efx than the original. this episode was down right creepy as hell. i\\'m lucky to find it finally on dvd today and very rare and hard to find. the only other 2 ghost stories to even come close was the original \" the haunting \" and george c. scott in \" the changling \" . wish someone would do more ghost stories like these. okay, i\\'ve watched this movie twice now, i have researched it heavily on the net, i have asked several people on there opinions. i have even gone to the length of reading the original sheridan lafanu classic \\'carmilla\\', a book that this movie is supposed to be based on. i feel that the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play whilst watching it. as the plot of the movie doesn\\'t seem to make any sense at all, here is the plot of the book. laura lives in a castle in syberia with her father, mr de lafontaine. they carry on with their lives blissfully and peacefully. one day they get a letter from the \\'general\\' a man who has made it his mission in life to avenge his daughters death. he makes claims of supernatural powers being at work, and explains that he will visit them soon. meanwhile, a chance encounter with a strange woman results in the lafontaines looking after her daughter, carmilla, for several months. soon laura starts to be overwhelmed by strange dreams, and begins to come down with a strange illness. who is this mysterious carmilla? and just what has she to do with laura\\'s condition, and the general? i have invented this game and would like as many people as possible to play it, and let me know what their results are. i even have a catchy name, and would have a jingle too, but i can\\'t be bothered with that. it\\'s called the \"this movie doesn\\'t make any sense\" game. all you have to do is, whilst watching the movie, try to come up with a complete plot that explains what is happening. i mean complete, all questions answered, everything makes sense, absolutely complete. it will have to answer such questions as ... * why can vampires walk around in day light? * why are they all lesbians? * why is a girl called bob? and why does she shoot herself? * when is the movie a dream and when is it real? * why does killing zombies appear to be an accepted part of life that doesn\\'t make anyone bat an eyelid? * why does travis fontaine spot and run down a zombie without slowing down whilst driving his car, yet when faced with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car, accept the excuse that she is a zombie too? * and why does he then let a girl, which he later openly reveals that he knows is the head vampire, drive with him in his car? * and then let her drive off, alone with his daughter in a stolen car? what the hell is the asylum scene all about? * what the hell is the green goo all about? * why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like a nurse? * why are there never any vampires fighting zombies? * what is the significance of the necklace? what is it made of? why does it kill vampires? and how does jenna know that? in fact sod it, it\\'s just as much fun trying to come up with as many questions about this movie too. i have my plot, and i have to admit it is not quite there, but it is a pretty good effort. in conclusion \\'vampires vs zombies\\' has no moment in it where there are actually vampires fighting zombies. everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what is going on, yet they seem very reluctant to let the audience in on this. and somehow it is based on a classic 19th century horror novel. how? why? what the hell is going on? this would\\'ve been a *great* silent film. the acting really is good, at least in a look ma, i\\'m doing really big acting! sort of way. everything is huge. every line is profound! every scene is shattered by human tragedy! mostly, i felt like gagging. yet, like any train wreck, i couldn\\'t tear my eyes away. this dialogue might\\'ve worked on the stage, although i doubt it. on the screen, it was cluttered, haphazard, hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work. if you enjoy your melodrama in huge, heaping doses, you *might* enjoy the movie. be prepared to wait, however. for all that melodrama, this thing sure plods along at its own pace. this script must\\'ve sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves. it simply doesn\\'t work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera. imdb does us a great disservice, at times, when it uses its goofy computer-controlled \"weighted score\". curse of the starving class deserves less than a 1. character-driven fiction is great, but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution, it isn\\'t character development! your characters must have a motivation. being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is *not* character development. that\\'s a plot contrivance. stay away from this movie. or at the very least, watch it muted. perhaps you\\'ll get some amusement from all the arm-waving the characters do. oh, and word to the wise -- to prove that this is truly an artsy film, you see james woods in all his dangly male \"look-at-me, i\\'m-the-figurative-and-literal-representation-of-the-naked-vulnerability-of- man\" glory. don\\'t say you weren\\'t warned. this movie starts with the main character lying in a coma in a hospital ward, attended by two orderlies. the unconscious main character is heard in a voice over, saying that the orderlies are gay. the orderlies kiss. i watched this in a dvd version and i have the suspicion that this is supposed to be funny â– it said â„comedy\" on the dvd case, after all and it goes on like that. had i seen this in a movie theater i probably would have heard part of the audience roar with laughter, because it is so funny â– and because they are supposed to sit in a comedy. while it is fascinating to think about what it is funny and what isn\\'t, this movie unfortunately only delivers arguments about what isn\\'t. brilliant brains can make anything funny, people like ernst lubitsch, billy wilder or mel brooks have proved that fact. but you have to know the â„mechanics\", i suppose. director and co-scriptwriter dani levy does not bother about those mechanics, he thinks that certain things simply are funny, the fact that two orderlies are gay and kiss over a man in a coma, for example. do not get me wrong, some people can make that funny, dani levy can\\'t, not for me, anyway. the main problem i have with this movie is that i can\\'t see a reason behind the way the main characters behave. i could not understand why the two brothers, one an orthodox jew from west germany one a third class carbon copy of fast eddie felson from former east germany so strongly disliked each other. they are both rather bland characters. their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other (well, one is a lesbian now but raises the daughter she has with her cousin). but even these incestuous relationships â– if anything they are embarrassing - just come through as an excuse because the scriptwriters could not come up with anything better. the acting is not bad, udo semel i actually came to like quite a lot although he reminded me more of ex chancellor helmut kohl (a lighter version) than of a venerable orthodox jew. the direction in itself is not really bad either, but maybe levy should stick to directing movies, leaving the scriptwriting to someone else. now i heard he did a comedy about hitler. oi, vai! this story about three women is a very sensitive study about: muriã«l (charlotte van den eynde) the youngest, laura (els dottermans) who is about 37 and martha (frieda pittors) the oldest who is the mother of muriã«l. they live together in the same building. they have different expectations of life. the vital laura wants a child. muriã«l comes from a village and wants to change her life in brussels. martha dreams about her youth when she was a young girl. in fact nothing happens in this movie so you wait for something - for instances an accident - which could dramatize this story. as times goes on, you discover that the director dorothã©e van den berghe only wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three women and nothing more. this movie is disappointing because you expect the women to learn from their experiences which is not the case, so one is left with a feeling of emptiness. first and foremost, i loved the novel by ray bradbury. it\\'s the kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later. it was one of his best books, with, you know, fahrenheit 451 and dandelion wine. i as just hoping that this movie would be all right. it had lots of chances, with a great cast, like jason robards and jonathn pryce. and bradbury even wrote the script himself. and on top of all that, it has pam grier! how could it fail? there may be spoilers within. first of all, it was dumbed down. much of the horror from the book was lost as bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to a minimum. all the visuals from the book...gone. everything that made you squirm...gone. and then there\\'s the acting. like a lot of movies that disney threw out in the 80s, the kids in this movie cannot act. and, this bugged me a lot, neither of them looked 13 but 9 or 10. their strong friendship wasn\\'t addressed. it was more like they were acquaintaces. you\\'d think jason robards and jonathan pryce could pull this off in their roles of mr. halloway and mr. dark. but here it\\'s like they just don\\'t care. all they want to do is somehow pay off some mortgage or something. this is far from being some of their best performances. pam grier was fine as the witch, but the charecter of the dust witch herself wasn\\'t well pulled off. she\\'s a lot less evil and doesn\\'t have the presence as she did in the book. and everything that was left out of the book. the ballon night chase, the marking of jim\\'s house, the real death of mr. dark, what happened to mr. coogan on the merry-go-round, the fate of the lightening rod salesman, the real death of the witch, and oh so much more. and the special effects were bad, even for the 80s. the merry-go-round of doom for one thing with the superimposed horses going around wasn\\'t really creepy, and that weird green mist that really had nothing to do with anything. i could keep going about how this movie ripped apart the original novel, but it makes blood boil. don\\'t see this movie but read the book. it\\'s a classic of bradbury. this film is so old i never realized how young looking ray milland looked in 1936, i remember him playing in a great film, \"lost weekend\". ray plays the role of michael stuart, who is a very rich banker. there are three girls in this picture who are not very happy about their father and mother separating and they find out their father is going to get married to a young blonde who is a gold digger only looking for a rich sugar daddy. they hire a man to pose as a very rich count, his name is count ariszted, (misha auer) who is drunk all the time and is penniless and gives plenty of comic laughs throughout the picture. deanna durbin, (penny craig) surprised everyone when she was booked in a police station and told the chief of police that she was an opera star and then penny starts singing with the most fantastic soprano voice i have every heard, the entire police department and convicts started applauding, which was a very entertaining and enjoyable scene from this film. this is deanna durbin\\'s first film debut and she became an instant success over night and went on to become a great movie star with universal studios after leaving mgm. i had eagerly awaited the first screening of this film ever since it was given to me on dvd at christmas. having reserved a special slot for it last night, i sat down to watch it with my daughter (aged 17 and a film studies student), with chocolates of course, in eager anticipation. we love jane austin. after just the first two minutes we knew we were sunk. the shaky camera shots and angles, general poor cinematography, direction and wooden performances had already left us feeling flat and dissatisfied. despondent, we viewed on. anne, played by sally hawkins, looked oddly and with no particular purpose, directly at the camera on several occasions, breaking our hard-won \\'fantasy of the moment\\' and engaging us directly in an almost \\'i\\'ll find you\\' stalking fashion. poor rupert penry-jones, who played captain wentworth, did his best with the script and direction, bless him. i hope they paid him well, however, as he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably breached the seawall, drenching him and his co-actor. they were nearly swept out to sea. health and safety would have had a field day! poor rupert was left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line. presumably there was not enough money left in the kitty for a re-shoot of this scene. anyone with any sense would have not attempted it on such a day in the first place. other than mr. penry-jones, alice krige gave the only convincing performance as lady russell but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of anthony head\\'s unconvincing portrayal of annoying sir walter elliott. towards the long-awaited end of the film, captain wentworth appeared to oddly grace anne with a visit every two seconds having taken great pains to avoid her for the majority of the movie. it was as if he had developed a memory impediment which caused him to forget his very reason for being. in contrast, anne ran, hyper-ventilating, from pillar to post in search of the good captain who, in the meantime, had managed to call upon almost the entirety of bath we are told, in the course of only three or four minutes, without even having worked up a sweat. we experienced none of anne\\'s charms crossing the screen. indeed, we were left wondering what charismatic captain wentworth had ever seen in plain, spineless, opinion-less anne and why someone, anyone, did not tell mean, winging sir walter to just shut the heck up. the crucial kiss, normally our favourite girlie moment, was painfully drawn out. as they moved in closer, anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look as if she were chewing gum before lips finally met. eww! the most enjoyable thing about last night was the chocolates and the half hour exchange of views between mother and daughter on just how bad the film had been. what a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story, filmed in some of england\\'s finest scenery. sorry jane. if you like sci-fi, monsters, and ancient legends, then you will love this movie!! the special effects are by far the best i have seen since juarassic park hit the big screen years ago. while the acting may have been a little less than desirable, the story line and effects adequately compensated for it. i wish now i had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch big screen tv. if you like non-stop action, awesome visuals, and taste for myth and lore....you have to see this movie!! a rather silly little film you just may love. although rather corny and clichã© at times, it nonetheless works and makes for good clean fun. five teams are engaged on a scavenger hunt and battle each other and their wits to win the all night contest - just for the sheer joy \"knowing yours is the best team.\" notable for several screen debuts including david naughton\\'s first film role after his dr. pepper \"be a pepper\" commercials and before his major 1981 hit \"american werewolf in london\". also features paul ruebens in what i believe is his first pee wee herman-esquire roll a year before he became known for it. and last but not least, mr. spin city and alex keaton himself, michael j. fox gets his first film role here. fans will remember stephen furst as flounder in animal house. outside of that, no names, but all funny characters. doubt it has ever made it to dvd, but there are still probably some vhs copies floating around and you might even catch on a late, late show sometime. if you do, is worth your watch. you may hate it, but it may also become a quirky little movie you come to love. this is an ok adaptation of the breath taking book of dan brown. i can\\'t say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy. given the excellent story, the result could have been better though. the movie is pretty long but at the end i was feeling like some things were missing. sound effects and sound tracks were very good. acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak. for people who didn\\'t read the book, things may look happening too quickly. from my point of view, instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book, they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper. what makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of vatican. you see neither of it in the movie. too much rush and using the time not in a good way, these are main problems of the movie. so, it is worth watching but could have been done better. i never fell asleep during a movie. never. this movie did the impossible. while many people claim the superiority of japanese horror films over their american counterparts, this movie was a lesson in over abundance. as in, the movie was 30 minutes too long. it would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera work, but instead, all we got were awkward silences and a lot of slow movement. the acting was absolutely terrible, bordering on bad student film levels while everyone struggled to ad-lib something called a script. did these people even get any direction? were they coaxed to be boring and dull? either therory wouldn\\'t surprise me. what was even worse was the rather unscary make-up involved with the creatures from the other side. either way, they all stunk. don\\'t watch this film. that\\'s all i can say (unless you\\'re an insomniac). what can i say? not as bad as many here have made it out to be. the only reason i even watched this film that i had previously never heard of before, was strictly for ian mcshane. i was not disappointed in the least. ian mcshane was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role. he\\'s always great to watch and for my money... an extremely underused actor. as for the rest of the film.... every other actor in the movie delivered strong, solid performances. these people certainly weren\\'t being paid huge amounts of cash for their participation (as this was a fairly low budget film) but this did not mean that any of them \"mailed\" their appearances in. everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to them. i was even pleasantly surprised at adrian paul\\'s performance though i must admit i have only ever seen him in the highlander television series before this movie. the plot was well paced and the storyline intriguing and much like real life, not everything ends up tied in a nice neat little package for you at the end of the film. anybody who expected a clear-cut, by-the-numbers, connect the dots \"conclusion\" or \"answer\" at the end of the movie... clearly wasn\\'t watching the film closely enough! this film is not going to tell you what the \"meaning of life\" is! the idea is that after seeing the film, you might go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over a coffee. i certainly did. no car chases... no explosions... no bar room brawls.... (sounds pretty dull, huh?) but the reality is that i was completely absorbed by the film and it\\'s just a well written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performances by all parties involved. ****** warning...****** if you\\'re the kind of person who dislikes movies that dangle an enormous \"question\" as the central engine of the story and then end the movie without answering that particular question directly... you might not enjoy this film. originally harped as a sequel to \"the slumber party massacre\" series, this film falls flat on it\\'s face with a new title. first off, if you are going to include the word \"massacre\" in your film\\'s title, you better deliver. this one certainly does not. there is no gore, no on screen murders and no chainsaw, as the box art would lead you to believe. instead, we get a paper thin, overdone plot about a group of cheerleaders who get stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football game, only to be offed one by one. again, this film could have been ok if the gore quotient was upped a bit. why directors, especially those doing direct-to-video flicks, are afraid to show any gore is beyond me. now, i am not a huge fan of excessive gore, but come on...why else would anyone rent a movie called \"cheerleader massacre??\" besides that problem, the film suffers from a shot-on-a-home-video-camera cheapness. it looks cheap, sounds cheap, and the actors aren\\'t all that good. it tries to throw us off track to who the killer may be, but even that fails. the ending ends up being a ridiculous mess. folks, if you run across this film, walk away and go find the original \"slumber party massacre.\" 2 out of 10. a killer, cannibal rapist is killed by a crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder. at his grave a cult have gathered with plans to resurrect him by peeing onto the grave. this of course works and he awakes ripping the guys penis off and he is back into his old killing ways with an all new zombie look. the two cops one of who is going a little crazy about the scum of the city and has a drug problem, are back on the case. two of the original cult member also tries to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing. thinking they have filed they leave but out from the grave comes a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection. sounds a bit confusing really but no its just rubbish. the acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy that plays dr vincent van gore in the faces of gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this film. the other cop just about struggles to get his terrible lines out. now i\\'m all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible. if it wasn\\'t for the very easy on the eye ladies and their nakedness i would probably have fallen asleep. there is a bit of gore but it\\'s never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims. the zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims with is kind of funny at times. there is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. the doll with the chipmunks voice is the stupidest thing i have ever seen in a film. it is just a plastic toy on a fishing line. the ending is extremely bad. you would expect the killer to put up much more of a fight than he does. god knows how they made enough money to make a sequel. 4/10 days of heaven is one of the most painfully boring and pointless films i have ever seen. in no way, shape, or form would i recommend it to anyone...unless you\\'re trying to put your kids to sleep or, god forbid, give someone an aneurysm. if i could go back in time and do one thing, i would set fire to the reels before they were sent to theaters. why? days of heaven\\'s plot is simple, but extremely vague. long sequences devoid of dialogue compose much of the film. the characters are too shallow and ridiculously stupid to relate with. the climax of the story does not touch you: by this time your brain has worked so hard to figure out the plot and the array of hidden metaphors that your ability to think is gone. the only things working are your eyes, and unfortunately, your ears, who must listen to the sound of linda, the little girl in the story, who talks like a man. i am now dumber for seeing this movie. don\\'t let it happen to you. in 1929, director walt disney and animator ub iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their \"silly symphonies\" series, \"the skeleton dance\". iwerks and disney had been collaborating together since the early 20s, in disney\\'s \"laugh-o-gram\" cartoon series; however, their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when iwerks accepted an offer by a competitor to leave disney and start his own animation studio. that was the birth of celebrity productions, where iwerks continued developing his style and technique (and where he created the character of flip the frog). while his work kept the same high quality, it wasn\\'t really popular and by 1936 the studio was closed. later that year, iwerks was hired by columbia pictures, and iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance, this time in color. 1937\\'s \"skeleton frolics\" is essentially, a remake of the 1929 classic \"the skeleton dance\", the movie that borough him fame and fortune. like that short film, it is set on an abandoned graveyard, where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play. the dead rise from their coffins, ready for the show that\\'s about to begin, as a group of skeletons has formed an orchestra, and begin to play a happy tune. now, it\\'s not easy to be a musician made of just bones, as some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts, however, the band manages to put a good show and another group of skeletons begin to dance. a lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra: it\\'s hard to dance with loose body parts. everything ends at dawn, and just when the sun is about to rise again, the skeletons run towards their graves. directed and animated by ub iwerks himself, \"skeleton frolics\" follows faithfully the pattern set by \"the skeleton dance\" years before, although with a crucial difference: iwerks did the whole film in technicolor. the bright tonalities allowed iwerks to create a more visually appealing film, and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving disney, creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those he conceived before. it is certainly a more experimental film than \"the skeleton dance\", although sadly, this doesn\\'t mean it\\'s necessarily a better film. for starters, the film is practically identical to the one he did with disney, with the only differences being the music (more on that later) and the color effects. it looks beautiful, no doubt about it, but it definitely feels kind of unoriginal after all. however, it is not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurts the film (after all, iwerks executes it in a wonderful way), but the fact that the musical melody created by joe denat for the film is pretty uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one done by carl w. stalling for \"the skeleton dance\". in other words, while denat\\'s tune is effective and appropriate for the theme, it\\'s easy to forget about it rapidly while stalling\\'s song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable. being a musical film, this is of high importance, and so the mediocrity of the music brings down iwerk\\'s flawless work of animation. personally, i think that with a better musical accompaniment, \"skeleton frolics\" would be remembered as fondly as \"the skeleton dance despite not being as groundbreaking, as it\\'s still a fun film to watch. it\\'s kind of sad that most of the work iwerks did after leaving disney is now forgotten due to his poor success, however, it must be said that if iwerks lacked the popularity of disney or fleischer (disney\\'s main rival), he did not lack the quality of those companies\\' films. it was probably just a case of bad luck what made the man who gave life to disney\\'s mouse for the first time to face failure out of disney. despite its shortcomings, \"skeleton frolics\" is a very funny and visually breathtaking film, that while not exactly the most original and fresh film (one just can\\'t help but thinking of \"the skeleton dance\" while watching it), it definitely reminds us that iwerk\\'s skeletons are still here to haunt us, and inspire us. 8/10 yes, indeed, it could have been a good movie. a love biangle, (sorry for the poetical license, but is not a triangle!) an interesting story, unfortunately badly told. the image is sometimes weird, sometimes ok, the picture looks crowded and narrow-sighted. the sound needs more attention (it usually does in romanian movies), the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen. the soundtrack is short and is not helping the action. about the acting... sorry but the best actress is the landlady. the others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer. the acting is poetical when it should be realistic, and realistic when it should be poetical. it\\'s a picture for adults, told by the children. bother only if extremely curious. you wear only the best italian suits from armani, hand stitched and fitted to your exact measurements. your automobile is the finest that german engineering has to offer, and is equipped with as many gadgets as horses under the hood. you\\'re a member of the finest polo clubs, frequently dine at restaurants such as spago, and are always accompanied by at least two of the most beautiful women in the world. your pocket watch doubles as a nuclear explosive, while your trusty pen can also be used as a semi-automatic .22 caliber gun. you snow ski in the alps, go deep sea diving in the caribbean, sky dive over the andes, and all the while your hair is never, ever, out of place. you are bond, james bond, the world\\'s most renown spy, favorite son of the good queen, bad boy of the british ss, and perhaps the most desired man in the world. the character of james bond was created by ian fleming, and is the movie industry\\'s longest lasting icon, being the subject of over fifteen films spanning over four decades. the latest man to play the role is pierce brosnan, who took over the role of james bond from timothy dalton in 1996, and made his 007 debut in goldeneye. this is the setting for the first major title developed by a third party on the nintendo 64. goldeneye, developed by rare for nintendo, has been on the market for some time. its continued dominance in the sales charts is just one testament to how good this game is, and no review library would be complete without it. let\\'s face it -- most of the time movie-licensed games are flops. although the two seem like a good mix, the results, for the most part, have been horrendous. games like cliffhanger, true lies, lethal weapon, and not to mention all the star trek flops, are ammunition enough against this mix. and for the record i am not a fan of movie licensed games, especially if i\\'ve seen the movie. at least that\\'s how i used to think. in the case of goldeneye, i had more reservations than normal. while not a bad movie, goldeneye the film didn\\'t have that much appeal to it, and i don\\'t rank it in the top ten amongst bond movies. as a game, however, let\\'s just say it\\'s a completely different story. the game is a first-person shooter, and in order to be successful, you\\'ll need at least as much brains as brawn. for those who have seen the movie, which i imagine is most of you reading this, the story is very consistent and follows the path of the movie with little variation. a plot to control the world\\'s most dangerous satellite, goldeneye, has begun in the ussr, and in the process a beautiful woman has been captured. your missions will be many, the danger extreme. you will have to rely on your wits and experience to get you through the most grueling missions the world has ever known. m will brief you as soon as you\\'re ready. good day, james. this is an excellent film about the characters in a adult swimming class, their problems, relationships and interactions with each other. it should have managed a wider distribution as it\\'s much better than similar films from major studios out at the same time. the swimming instructor is an almost-olympian, reduced to teaching adults basic lessons, and often the target of horndogging from his female students. he attempts, more or less, to fend them off, with varying results. the students characters are mainstream u.s.a; teachers, policemen, college students and retired people, all of whom haven\\'t learned to swim for some reason. the movie covers their relationships, including friends, relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class. several subplots provide amusing fodder, including a teacher going through a divorce, some high school students making a documentary, and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys. this is a good date movie, or just one to watch when you\\'re in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of reality. this mostly routine fact-based tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole. this is the story of a highly trained military man, unhappy with his wife and children, fakes his demise and runs off with the other woman. to support her in the manner in which she is accustomed he robs banks. predictable, but not a bad watch. i watched six of a kind for w.c. fields - he\\'s only in it for around 10 minutes and has one long scene, the infamous pool sequence he made famous in vaudeville, and several other great moments. the reamaining 55 minutes are also delightful, thankfully, mostly due to the hilarious charlie ruggles as the bumbling banker j. pinkham whinney. he is everyone\\'s foil. he stutters and stumbles about to our pleasure. also, his comedy partner, mary boland plays his wife, flora. joining in the proceedings are george burns and gracie allen. boland is particularly funny near the beginning and near the end, but gracie and ruggles use up most of the picture. gracie\\'s funny, quite, but she can also get tiring. and poor george burns has absolutely nothing to do except repeat gracie all the time. i don\\'t remember laughing at him once (although he has one great scene with ruggles, where ruggles tries desperately to get george to take gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while, and one with fields, where he asks fields to sell him a sweater; that bit is exclusively fields\\', though). the situation is constantly funny: the whinneys are going to drive to california, but to help them with expenses, george and gracie are recruited. 8/10. edmund lowe (who reminds me somewhat of warren william), heads the nice cast of an interesting little mystery that moves at a brisk pace and runs just a little over an hour. douglas walton plays the unlucky jockey who appears to be intent on his own demise (hypnotism, anyone?), and the suspects include a good number of the supporting cast--everyone from virginia bruce, kent smith, frieda inescourt, gene lockhart, jessie ralph, benita hume, rosalind ivan and h.b. warner. as an added bonus, there\\'s nat pendleton as a dimwit detective--and furthermore, get a load of that art deco set decoration for the fancy interiors of a wealthy home. must have been a set that was used in many a subsequent film. on the plus side, the mystery is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot with reasonable assurance of not being too baffled. it\\'s all suddenly clear to detective philo vance--and then he has a final confrontation with the murderer that gives the film a nifty five minutes of unmitigated suspense. nicely done and passes the time in an entertaining manner. this movie is lame and not funny at all. the plot doesn\\'t even make sense. some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension (maybe hell???) and his daughter gets sucked through it or something, then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit (i guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her?) the main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she\\'s more interested in her new girlfriend, and they stumble upon this witch spell book (they want to be witches or something???) and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently. there is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary, obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie. i\\'m sure the topless girls doesn\\'t hurt there either. the extra features on the dvd were even more confusing than the rest of the movie, i thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing. who are these people and what are they doing? basically this is a go-camping-to-make-out-then-fight-a-monster movie but there are a bunch of things (like the other dimension and book seller) than make it confusing. i didn\\'t like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal. i don\\'t recommend watching it though it was just too stupid, i can\\'t think of any part of the movie that was good. although i was hoping that i\\'d like it a little more, this was still certainly an impressive film. there were great performances by all the leads, and the story, while not what i\\'d call chilling, was still effective and it kept me interested. for me, the best part of this film was the look of the picture, for it always looked cold and damp and it just really seemed to suit the film well. i also thought that the low budget suited this movie, for i don\\'t think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked as well in a film this grim. all things considered, it fell a little short of my expectations, but i\\'m still very glad that i finally sat down to watch this movie. imagine this: a high school. except it\\'s boarding school, and the kids don\\'t have parents around. oh, and it\\'s in malibu. and the kids are all thin, white, and gorgeous, with the exceptional token minority or fat kid to play the \"weird\" outcast. and there aren\\'t any reasonable rules, like how they have co-habitation, nuclear weapons in their dorms, coffee stands, a sushi bar, and a complimentary laptop per student. here\\'s the story: a girl, zoey brooks, attends pca, a formerly all-boys school. absolutely perfect in every possible way, she is smart, pretty, thin, athletic, creative, and everything a perfectionist wants to be. almost all the boys in school want her, and every girl wants to be her friend. she\\'s the one everyone comes to for advice, the one who saves the day with a simplistic plan, and is just wonderful. too bad none of this makes her likable. are we supposed to believe that if we don\\'t even come close to zoey\\'s perfection, we\\'re bad people? in the show, nothing\\'s her fault, and if anyone contradicts her, they\\'re portrayed as the bad guy(logan). he may be a jerk, but at least he has some kind of brain that thinks for himself instead of simply agreeing with the princess every time. her loyal group of blind followers are: chase, the average dumb ass that has a secret crush on her, michael, the token black guy (and the only decent actor on the set), lola, a wannabe actress and anorexic, snobby airhead, quinn, the smart but clueless girl when it comes to teen stuff, and logan, the rich jerk who has a soft side. yeah, this show basically spews out stereotypes. what ticks me off, though, is that they all try to pretend they\\'re normal kids. they complain that logan gets too much money while they have to work themselves, even though they already go to a too-good-to-be-true boarding school and have relatively nice things that many teenagers can\\'t afford. they drink coffee and eat sushi on a regular basis, hardly have homework, and suntan almost every day. wow, they have it hard! any other problems? i\\'m too good-looking, rich, and stress-free! i guess zoey 101 (what\\'s the 101 for, anyway?) is nick\\'s attempt at trying to portray teens realistically. except they caught a glimpse of reality, didn\\'t like it, and decided to give the kids lives like the asses on the hills. but hey, at least the set\\'s pretty. i had been amazed by director antal\\'s kontroll back in 2003. his first american project, vacancy, was less impressive but a decent start. armored is his second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable, the film never rises above the level of a b movie. it\\'s a shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for twists and turns and the ensemble cast featuring many quality actors should be able to deliver. antal could have made a great heist film but instead goes for an action flick. then again he could have shot a cool action flick but it doesn\\'t really deliver in that department either. what you are left with is one implausible situation after another, a group of poorly sketched characters bicker and fight over a sum of money. if you look past the sharp cinematography, cast and the tight music score, you\\'re left with what could have been a below average direct-to-video featuring van damme or seagal. this was probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time. first of all, the reason i\\'m giving this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least peter falk gave his usual fantastic performance as lieutenant columbo. he alone can get 10 stars for trying to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at making a movie. i was initially all fired up at reading one poster\\'s comment that andrew stevens in this movie gave \"the performance of his career.\" to me, it was the abysmal performance by stevens that absolutely ruined this movie, and so i was all prepared to hurl all sorts of insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment. then i thought to myself, what else has stevens done? so i checked and, you know, that person was absolutely right. in the 17 years since this columbo movie was made, apparently every one of the 33 projects that stevens has been in since then has been utter crap, so it is doubtful that anybody has even seen the rest of his career. if you like columbo, see every other of the 69 titles before watching this one. do yourself a favor and save the worst for last. this movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years. not even woody harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom. the murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not, nothing is of any interest. the cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful , i just sat in utter amazement during this movie, thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertaining the producers of this movie were very clever. they made a boring movie but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast. people will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think, woody harrison ,kristin scott thomas and willem dafoe this must be good and rent this movie.(boy are they in for a horrible time) if you like getting ripped off go and rent this movie, some people actually did enjoyed this movie but i like to watch a movie with meaning down at the movie gallery, i saw a flick i just had to see. it looked like a fun low-budget horror/action/western that i could get into. yeah, i knew it would suck, but i rented it anyway hoping for laughs. only a few laughs were to be found. this was an extremely stupid movie. it begins with a bounty hunter, our protagonist, who is possibly the weakest main character in the history of film. he looks/acts like he could take on chuck norris, but he can\\'t. his dialogue sucks too. anyway, he goes into a village, shoots some zombies. you could tell they tried to make this longer by putting in these boring scenes where he takes 3-5 minutes to reload or watch some zombies. at least the zombies look cool. so anyway, some people get shot, some zombies die, and in the end, everyone is dead except our main character, who should have died at the beginning when he was shot down by four people. i am finally seeing the el padrino movie, from what i can see it is an incredible film, and lots of action damian chapa is good director, but i must admit i love his acting the best. also i saw the behind the scenes it was edited by some lady named kinga, she needs to go back to school and learn how to edit. however the film el padrino is a pure 10 action epic. why cant most people who direct put together films that keep you wondering what the plot is? i am so happy to see someone i know to be a real great actor become a great director also. i am one of those people who love to see artists make it. b.s. i thrive on cinema....but there is a limit. a name isn\\'t enough to make a movie!. the beginning of the movie puts us in a mood to expect the unseen yet. but we remain hungry ( or angry..) till the end . things are getting so confused that i admit that i did not understand the end or was there an end to this nonesense. the opportunity to make an outstanding movie was there but the target was totally missed. next... michael callan plays a smarmy photographer who seems, nonetheless, to be regarded as a perfect \"catch\" by any woman that runs across him; could this have anything to do with the fact that he also co-produced the film? he\\'s a \"hero\" whom it\\'s very difficult to empathize with, so the movie is in trouble right from the start. however, it\\'s troubles don\\'t end there. it has the production values of a tv-movie (check out that head made of clay or something, near the end), and the ending cheats in a way that i can\\'t reveal, in case anyone wants to see the movie (highly unlikely). let\\'s just say that the killer knows more than we were let to know he knows. (*1/2) i was drawn to \"friends\" by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous elton john whom i had see in a club in nearby houston. i had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make. recently i was brought back to the movie by a song that heart did called \"seasons\", then i found the elton john song \"friends\" thinking it was the same song...it\\'s been 35 years of so. anyway, the flood of the emotions of \"friends\" came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love. i have more recall of the way the movie hit me than i do of the actual details of the production, plot, etc. so forgive me for a rather poor review. i remember taking a couple of special friends on a date to see the movie and them being as moved and teary-eyed at the end as i was. i\\'m both anxious and nervous to find a copy and see it now. so many movies which seemed so important to me back then (i.e. \"the graduate\" \"easy rider\") now just seem silly and i don\\'t want this to fall into the same category. but, i will find it and if it turns out silly, then at least i\\'ll be able to turn my wife onto a great...no..outstanding soundtrack. when we met, we went through this with \"last tango in paris\". the youngsters i work with (i\\'m 56) respect my opinions but it\\'s hard to explain the feelings of the sixties and the movies and songs that reflect such strong feelings but seem a little \"aged\" now. i just can\\'t figure out if the the aging process is the movies... or me. \"friends\" is a very special, sensitive and wonderful movie. it will bring back a lot of special feelings i\\'m sure. by all means, rent or buy a copy... indies were not near the strong genre then that they are today. during the clete roberts preface, i was beginning to think this was an ed wood production, however, what rolls out here is some pretty hard hitting stuff. the story of crime and corruption in a southern town is told using a cast culled from hollywood\\'s poverty row, and this makes the movie all the more realistic. there are no punches pulled here, and at times the film is reminiscent of \"the well\"(1951). the black and white texture gives a newsreel-like quality. for certain, younger viewers will be reminded of \"the blair witch project\" but this one is based on real events! i decided to watch this one because it\\'s been nominated for oscar this year. i guess as many folks here i really wanted to like this movie, but ended up bored and disappointed. first scene was ok but the whole rest of the movie in \"shaky hands\" camera mode is really annoying. i guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for oscar is this: american \"military machine\" (people, who makes money on war) urgently need an excuse or justification of war in iraq by bungling up something (sort of) patriotic. why these \"heroic\" efforts of director and the main character to _inspire_ the audience with an idea of \"loving-war-like-a-drug\"?.. oh, please, come on! what a bore! watch this to get an idea of how low the movie academy can fall... mom should really be given a different title to distinguish it from all the other movies out there called mom or with the word mom in the title. this is a vastly superior zombie movie to so much of the rubbish that gets churned out time after time and all end up much the same as every other zombie movie out there. it is so different and refreshing it almost defies categorisation. the kind old lady who takes in a creepy lodger, who just happens to be a flesh eater, who then infects the old lady who also turns into a flesh eating zombie, or ghoul, quite which exactly is not defined. there is pathos in the story as her son realises what she has become and while at first horrified, attempts to help her by supplying \\'food\\'. (i shall say no more about that, for fear of inserting a spoiler!) it is one of those \\'quiet\\' movies as opposed to guns blasting, explosions raging, car chases, etc boring etc that makes so many movies all the same rubbish, but still with enough gory moments to satisfy horror fans, whilst also inserting sadness into the story, along with nice touches of humour as opposed to downright silliness of some so-called \\'horror\\' movies. there is a particularly nice atmospheric shot at the beginning of the film, where the old lady is sitting alone in her room with only her christmas tree for company and looks so \\'innocent\\', but, what she becomes!! oh my! a gem of a movie and even if not your thing, should at least be viewed if only once by any true horror fan. empire of passion starts out deceptively - that is, if you\\'re immediately expecting it to be a horror movie. it\\'s like a riff on james m. cain\\'s the postman always rings twice, at first: seki (kazuko yoshiyuki) is a mother of two and a dutiful, hard-working wife to rickshaw driver gisaburo (takahiro tamura). but when he\\'s not around, and she\\'s at home with the baby, the feisty and aimless young man toyoji (tatsuya fuji) comes around to bring some goodies for seki... and a little extra. they\\'re soon sleeping together, but after he does something to her (let\\'s just say a \"shave\"), he knows that he\\'ll find out, and immediately proposes that they kill gisaburo. they drink him up, strangle him, and then toss him down a well. naturally, this will come back to haunt them - but that it\\'s literally, at least to them (at first super-terrified seki and then only later on skeptical toyoji), changes gears into the \\'kaidan\\', a japanese ghost story. this is a film where the horror comes not simply out of \"oh, ghost, ah\", but out of the total dread that builds for the characters. in a way there\\'s the mechanics of a film-noir at work throughout, if only loosely translated by way of a 19th century japanese village as opposed to an american city or small town (i.e. the snooping cop, the \"evidence\" found possibly by another, word getting around, suspicions aroused, etc). it\\'s compelling because seiko actually was against the plan from the start, manipulated by the lustful but ill-prepared toyoji, and her reactions to gisaburo\\'s re-appearances are staggering to her. take the one that comes closest to poetry: gisaburo\\'s ghost, pale-blue face and mostly silent, chilling stare, motions for seiko to get on the rickshaw. she does, reluctantly, and he pushes her around on a road she doesn\\'t know, in the wee hours before dawn, surrounded by smoke. most japanese ghost stories wish to heavens they could get this harrowingly atmospheric. while it starts to veer into hysterics towards the end, there\\'s so much here that director oshima gets right in making this a distinctive work. after hitting it huge in the international cinema world with in the realm of the senses (which, ironically, got banned in his own country), he made something that, he claimed, was even *more* daring that \\'senses\\'. maybe he was right; empire of passion has less graphic sexual content by far than its predecessor (also starring tatsuya fuji, a magnificently physical actor with an immense lot of range), but its daring lies in crafting a world of dread. you can believe in ghosts in this story, but you also have to believe how far down to their own personal hells these two would-be lovebirds will go. the snooping detective or the gossiping townspeople are the least of their worries: the fate of their very souls is at stake. and oshima takes what in other hands could be merely juicy pulp (sadly, it wouldn\\'t surprise me if an american remake was already in the works) and crafts shot after gorgeous shot, with repetition working its way into the mis-en-scene (i.e. the shots of seiko and toyoji walking on that road, the camera at a dutch angle, the world tilted and surrounding them in a grim blue hue) as well as some affecting movements that will stay with me long after i finish typing this (i.e. toyoji throwing the leaves by one hand into the well in slow motion, or how seiko\\'s nude body is revealed after she becomes blind). it\\'s daring lies in connecting on a level of the spirit- not to be confused with the spiritual, though there may be something with that as well- about life and death\\'s connections to one another, inextricably. it\\'s a classic waiting to be discovered. i am not a big music video fan. i think music videos take away personal feelings about a particular song.. any song. in other words , creative thinking goes out the window. likewise, personal feelings aside about mj, toss aside. this was the best music video of alltime. simply wonderful. it was a movie. yes folks it was. brilliant! you had awesome acting, awesome choreography, and awesome singing. this was spectacular. simply a plot line of a beautiful young lady dating a man , but was he a man or something sinister. vincent price did his thing adding to the song and video. mj was mj , enough said about that. this song was to video , what jaguars are for cars. top of the line, perfecto. what was even better about this was ,that we got the real mj without the thousand facelifts. though ironically enough, there was more than enough makeup and costumes to go around. folks go to youtube. take 14 mins. out of your life and see for yourself what a wonderful work of art this particular video really is. oh, my goodness. i would have never thought it was possible for me to see a thriller worse than domestic disturbance this soon, but here it is. armed with rotten plot, terrible editing, stilted acting, and headache-inducing \\'style\\' (sorry, i have no other words for it), sanctimony is the kind of movie that almost forces you to re-evaluate an entire genre; that is, this film is so bad that even the thrillers i condemned as complete failures now seem a little better. now, not only sanctimony is a terrible film in itself, it also succeeds in the difficult task of ripping off better movies and do a pathetic job with it. right from the main titles -- nothing but a blatant attempt to reproduce the ones from se7en -- i was under the impression that something didn\\'t smell quite right. as soon as the movie started with a series of corny, wanna-be hip quick-cuts full of gory images and bombastic colors, i knew where that smell was coming from. it turns out that two policemen, or rather policeman jim renart (michael parã©) and policewoman dorothy smith (jennifer rubin), are investigating on a murder spree in vancouver. a serial killer, known as \"monkey killer\" (what a menacing, chilling nickname, uh?) for his working methods, has killed quite a lot of people. you see, this nut apparently works following the proverb \"see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\" and cuts eyes, ears, and tongues out of his victims. so far, six eyes, six ears, and three tongues. in very ingenious fashion, renart and smith figure out that the monkey killer is probably going to kill other three people... well, because he probably wants to complete the number 666. so suddenly the film focuses on tom gerrick (casper van dien), a young, successful, good-looking businessman, with a dreadful temper. and that\\'s where the rip-off of american psycho kicks in. so we follow the life of the two police officers and the young psychopath, none of which is interesting in the least, until they finally meet. along the way to that, a disco where renart barely misses gerrick unintentionally offers us one of the funniest scenes in recent memory: renart goes in the back of the disco club, because... well, just because the script tells us it\\'s a suspect place; then, with one single punch in the stomach, renard gets rid of a big guard who blocks the path, and the guard is never heard of again? does this scene strike anyone else as completely unrealistic? anyway, after another murder, gerrick turns in as a witness, but smith and especially renart immediately suspect he might be the killer. in typical basic instinct fashion, smith gets some dates with the young businessman, under the assumption that she might discover his true identity. i won\\'t spoil the ending but it is, quite simply, an embarrassment; there are contradictions, some plot holes, issues that never get resolved, and especially there is one last scene where a brutal mass murder, supposed to be shocking and sad, comes off as such laughably overdone and nonsensical that i frankly can\\'t imagine how anyone could not laugh at it. at 87 minutes, sanctimony is really pushing it. you never care about one single character, because they are all so flat (not to mention boring) that you know exactly who is who the first time you meet them. you are never pulled into the story, because the scenes are connected through weak plot devices when not downright unnecessary and out of place. the acting ranges from average (van dien) to downright atrocious (rubin, and most of the supporting cast); the music is abysmal generic techno, and the photography is one of the worst i have ever seen. of course, like every fiasco of the genre, we are provided with a little bit of gratuitous nudity. 3/10 the man with a golden arm was one of a trio of great films around that same time that dealt with drug addiction. the other two were monkey on my back and a hatful of rain. but i think of the three this one is the best. maybe if otto preminger had shot the thing in the real chicago instead of those obvious studio sets the film might have been better yet. who knows, maybe preminger couldn\\'t get enough money to pay for the location. it\\'s the only flaw i find in the film. frank sinatra is a heroin addicted card dealer who was busted for covering for his boss robert strauss when the game was raided. he took the cure while in jail and wants a new life as a jazz drummer. but a whole lot of people are conspiring against him. first bob strauss who wants him back dealing, especially because a couple of heavyweight gamblers are in town. he uses a few underhanded methods to get sinatra\\'s services back. secondly darren mcgavin is the local dope dealer who wants sinatra good and hooked as a customer again. and finally eleanor parker his clinging wife who\\'s working a con game to beat all, just to keep him around. frank sinatra got a nomination for best actor for this film, but lost to ernest borgnine in marty. sinatra might have won for this one if he hadn\\'t won for from here to eternity in the supporting actor category a few years back and that marty was such an acclaimed film in that year. his scenes going through withdrawal locked up in kim novak\\'s apartment will leave you shaken. eleanor parker does not get enough credit for her role. she\\'s really something as the crazy scheming wife who wants sinatra tied to her no matter what the cost. if she had not been nominated that same year for interrupted melody, she might have been nominated for this. 1955 marked the high point of her career. darren mcgavin got his first real notice as the very serpentine drug peddler. his performance is guaranteed to make your flesh crawl. elmer bernstein contributed a great jazz score to accentuate the general dinginess of the bleak chicago neighborhood the characters live in. not a place you\\'d want to bring up your family. this film was basically set up for failure by the studio. one, anne rice (author of the book) offered to write the screen play but was refused by the studio. two, they tried to stuff 2 in depth novels in to a 2hour movie. i maintain the only way for these two books -vampire lestat and queen of the damned- to work in a live action form would be through a mini-series. first off the the vampire lestat alone takes place from the 1700\\'s to the 1980\\'s and has a plethora of character vital to the plot understanding of the main character, lestat. the entire book vampire lestat sets up the events of the second part queen of the damned. without that full understanding the premise of a movie is destroyed. lestat was not cruel and vicious to all, he was not wanting to go along with akasha\\'s plans, marius did not make lestat, lestat did not love jesse or make her, lestat could not go remain unscathed by the light, marius was not after david nor the other way around, every character was completely represented wrong, basically same names different story. if they wanted to make a vampire movie, fine. even if you wanted to be inspired by these novels, fine. but don\\'t piggie back into the theaters off the success of rice\\'s great novels and characters just to destroy what her loyal readers have come to love. if you haven\\'t read the books you won\\'t understand the film really, if you have read the books you will be insulted. that being said, i am such a huge fan i had to see the movie knowing full well this was going to be the case and still went for it. catch 22, must see it, will hate it. have previously enjoyed wesley snipes in several action flicks and i had expected a lot more, even from a score of 5.8 imdb, the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal, the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to mimic a \"worst case scenario\" of playing \"strong\" feelings accompanied by some bad acting... don\\'t waist your time this movie ã\\xadsnt entertaining, if you wanna cry it might suffice though, even though your tears will be wept due to seeing wesley snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedy... i give this 2/10 it really was awful, if you wanna see a decent movie go see shooter or rent it, its all the good things this movie isn\\'t. an intense thriller about a mute movie make-up artist who witnesses a snuff film being made when she is working late in the studio one night. after she tries to get away from the murder scene, she realizes she is in for more than she bargained for when the entire mafia is out to kill her for being a witness. this movie leaves you on the edge of your seat. don\\'t listen to most of these people. ill give you a better review of this movie which me and my friend love! its about jill johnson, played by camilla belle, who babysits at the mendrakis\\' house and someone breaks in. if you\\'re wondering how he got in the house, he went through the garage most likely. so anyway, don\\'t listen to, \"the worst acting\". it has amazing acting. with a great story. i think that there are 2 benefits that jill has. 1. shes a fast runner and is on the track team. 2.she got out alive! lol. it is a cool movie and quite scary. check it out, you will be happy with this masterpiece. don\\'t listen to the other people on the site. its very good. trust me, i am good at reviewing movies. i\\'m a future movie critic. i totally want to buy this movie. and you will too when you see it. it is amazingly awesome. what a frustrating movie. a small southern town is overflowing with possibilities for exploring the complexities of interpersonal relationships and dark underbellies hidden beneath placid surfaces, as anyone who has read anything by carson mccullers already knows. this does none of that. instead, the writers settled for cutesy twinkles, cheap warm fuzzies and banal melodrama. the thing looks like a made-for-tv movie, and was directed with no particular distinction, but it\\'s hard to imagine what anyone could have done to make this material interesting. the most frustrating aspect, though, is the fact that there are a lot of extremely competent and appealing actors in this cast, all trying gamely to make the best of things and do what they can with this--well, there\\'s no other word for it--drivel. a tragic waste of talent, in particular that of the great stockard channing. this movie starred a totally forgotten star from the 1930s, jack pearl (radio\\'s \"baron munchausen\") as well as jimmy durante. however, 7-1/2 decades later, it\\'s being billed as a three stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today. film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful edna may oliver as well as zazu pitts. as for the stooges, this is a film from there very early days--before mgm had any idea what to do with the team. at this point, they were known as \"ted healy and his stooges\" as healy was the front man. fortunately for the stooges, they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man (read up on him--you\\'ll see what i mean) and the rest is history. within a year, they were making very successful shorts for columbia and executives at mgm were soon kicking themselves for losing the team. this sort of thing was a common occurrence at mgm, a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy (such as the films of buster keaton, laurel and hardy, abbott and costello and others). in fact, up until they left for columbia, mgm put them in a wide variety of odd film roles--including acting with clark gable and joan crawford in dancing lady. and, oddly, in this film they didn\\'t act as a team--they just did various supporting roles, such as larry playing the piano! this particular film begins with pearl and durante lost in the african jungle. when they are rescued and brought home, all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like a variety show--punctuated by scenes with the leads here and there. as for pearl, i could really see why he never made a successful transition to films, as he has the personality of a slug (but slightly less welcome). as for durante, i never knew what the public saw in him--as least as far as his films are concerned--he was loud and...loud! he apparently took time off from helping mgm to ruin buster keaton\\'s career to make this film. together, pearl and durante rely on lots of verbal humor(?) and vaudeville-style routines that tend to fall rather flat. in this film, the stooges they didn\\'t yet have the right chemistry. seeing healy doing the job that moe did in their later films is odd. what they did in the film was pretty good, but because all the segments were short, they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines. stooges fans might be very frustrated at this, though die-hard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their life-long goal of seeing everything stooge--even the rotten joe derita and joe besser films (oh, and did they got bad after the deaths of shemp and curly). overall, the film is rather dull and disappointing. however, there are a couple interesting things to look for in the mess. at about the 13 minute mark, you will see a brief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing. look carefully, as this is walter brennan in a role you\\'d certainly never expect! another unusual thing to look for in the film is the \"clean as a whistle\" song starting at about 22 minutes into the film. this song and dance number is clearly an example of a so-called \"pre-code\" scene that never would have been allowed in films after 1934 (when the production code was strengthened). despite the word \"clean\" in the title, it\\'s a very titillating number with naked women showing lots of flesh--enough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything! it\\'s quite shocking when seen today, though such excesses were pretty common in the early 1930s. finally, at the 63 minute mark, see jimmy durante set race relations back a few decades. see the film, you\\'ll see that i mean! when carol (vanessa hidalgo) starts looking into her brother\\'s death, she begins to suspect something more sinister than \"natural causes\". the closer she gets to the truth, the more of a threat she becomes to her sister-in-law, fiona (helga line), and the rest of the local satanists. they\\'ll do whatever is necessary to put a stop her nosy ways. if you\\'re into sleazy, satanic-themed movies, black candles has a lot to offer. the movie is filled with plenty of nudity and ritualistic soft-core sex. one scene in particular involving a young woman and a goat must be seen to be believed. unfortunately, all the sleaze in the world can\\'t save black candles. most of the movie is a total bore. other than the one scene i\\'ve already mentioned, the numerous sex scenes aren\\'t shocking and certainly aren\\'t sexy. the acting is spotty at best. even genre favorite helga line gives a disappointing performance. the plot really doesn\\'t matter. its main function seems to be to hold the string of dull sex scenes together. i\\'m only familiar with one other movie directed by jose ramon larraz. compared with his daughters of darkness that masterfully mixes eroticism and horror, black candles comes off as amateurish. 3/10 is about the best i can do. one of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history. zodiac killer offers an imaginative take on the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killers. the filmmakers create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer, and anyone who remembers zodiac will be intrigued. others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal. unlike many serial killers, zodiac was not insane at all but very methodical and a self-promoter. the director here plays viewer expectations and pulls it off. the film is constructed as a murder mystery, or a \"cold case\"-style thriller. it is an intelligent investigative/procedural-style horror film that will put-off gore-hounds in search of cheap thrills. some people dislike any movie that is shot on video. this attitude is very old-style and provincial. it is an attitude and view of movies that puts technical issues above entertainment value or artistic value. these attitudes are on the way out. zodiac killer is a low-budget film, no doubt, but discerning viewers will look beyond that and find a carefully-crafted gem. i\\'ve read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life (eg what it takes to get into music school), britney bashing, etc, etc. so let\\'s focus on the movie and the message. i have rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years, and for a family movie. for the average adult male.... 2 out of 10. i like pop/rock music, i\\'m 45. i know of britney spears but never realised she actually sang stronger until i read the credits and these reviews. i didn\\'t recognise her poster on the wall so i was not worried about any \\'self promotion\\'. i watch movies to be entertained. i don\\'t care about casting, lighting, producers, directors, etc. what is the movie and does it entertain me. i watched this movie for the message. the world\\'s greatest epidemic is low self-esteem (which is a whole other story) so watched with the message in mind, as that is an area of interest. the movie is light, bright and breezy, great for kids. i found the texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give up/don\\'t give up message, so yeh, it was a bit predictable. great message though...should be more of them. this movie is a great family movie, but for a bloke watching by himself, get hannibal. i like this movie because it is a fine work of cinema, made by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movies. it is filled with super-surfer greg noll\\'s home movies, and a boatload of amateur video from others who align themselves with his 50-year passion. nevertheless, it has been expanded to the degree that it approaches aesthetic glory. it is filled with artistic talent, and athletic talent, however trivial you might think surfing to be athletic. surfers are not astronauts nor test-pilots. nor are they surgeons(perhaps) or ph.d\\'s(again, perhaps). it believes in the quest of the surfer. it believes in the beauty of human goofiness. it believes in the great gift of peace, which comes from the cessation of war. surfers celebrate the cessation of war on the north beach of an hawaiian island attacked by japanese zeroes fifteen years before. it celebrates the down-time of a country which fought a cold war-instead of a hot-war - with the russian socialists. surfing is the ultimate narcissism. it is dangerous, but only slightly historical. i suspect alexander the great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique. he had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he has received. this movie has no military heroes. it has no guns. the only beach-head surfers conquer has a beer-stand and and a surfboard shop. this is not a problem. peace is not desperate. it is the joy of exhalation. i had a hard time staying awake for the two hour opening episode. it was dumbed down to such an extent, i doubt if i learned a single thing. the graphics were rudimentary. any small idea was repeated ad nauseum. contrast this to the cosmos series hosted by carl sagan. that had a good musical theme. there was no music coming from these infernal 10-dimensional strings. although the plot of this film is a bit far-fetched, it is worth seeing just for the performances of michaels caine and gambon. the latter delivers a truly wonderful dublin accent. caine hams it up...which is exactly what the character he is playing should do. entertaining and fun, this is a hour and a half of easy watching. this movie was so badly written, directed and acted that it beggars belief. it should be remade with a better script, director and casting service. the worst problem is the acting. you have jennifer beals on the one hand who is polished, professional and totally believable, and on the other hand, ri\\'chard, who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece. peter gallagher and jenny levine are just awful as the slave owning (and keeping) couple, although both normally do fine work. the actors (and director) should not have attempted to do accents at all--they are inconsistent and unbelievable. much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual english. the casting is ludicrous. why have children of an \"african\" merchant (thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society ) been cast with very pale skinned actors, while the supposedly socially desirable marcel, has pronounced african features, including an obviously dyed blond \"fro\"? it\\'s as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color. it\\'s just so weird! this could be a great movie and should be re-made, but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors. there are plenty of good actors out there, and it would be fun to see how jennifer beals, daniel sunjata and gloria reuben would do with an appropriate cast, good script and decent direction. when i was a younger(oh about 2)i watched barney for the first time, and liked it. but, back then i didn\\'t exactly have a brain, either. and now i look back and see what a horrible show \"barney\" really is: first of all, everything on that show is creepy. barney, the main character, is a horrendous 9-foot tall talking, purple dinosaur that teaches 13-year-olds about \"imagination....\"(*shudders*) b.j.(i know what your thinking about his name.)is a smaller yet creepier yellow dinosaur that is put in to be \"supposudly\" cool. but in fact, he is the exact opposite. after watching a few episodes with b.j. dumbly trudging in with his slightly turned back cap, and making a few no-so-funny jokes, i wanted to scream. baby bop-oh-oh-god!(*vomits*)oh-oh-oh-anyway baby bop is the worst idea of a character ever. she is a green triceratops(it\\'s a dinosaur) that carries a yellow blanket. her remarks of \"hee-hee-hee\" and barney\\'s praises cries of \\'super-deeee-doooper\", make it hard to sit through each episode, as the seventh graders learn about shapes and manners. and that, my friend, is what makes this show truly horrible. steve mcqueen has certainly a lot of loyal fans out there. he certainly was a charismatic fellow, one of the most charismatic the big screen ever knew. but even mcqueen can\\'t save this turkey of a film, shot with what looks like a brownie camera in the actual locations in st. louis. mcqueen\\'s a new kid with no criminal record brought into the planning of a bank heist by one of the other gang. there\\'s more than a broad hint that there\\'s a gay relationship going on between young steve and david clarke. he\\'s not liked at all by the other heist members, mainly because of his lack of criminal resume. steve also has a girl friend in molly mccarthy and she suspects something afoot, especially when he starts hanging around with crahan denton and james dukas as well as clarke, all pretty rough characters. that would certainly get my suspicions aroused. the great st. louis bank robbery had two directors charles guggenheim and john stix. guggenheim did mostly documentaries and stix didn\\'t do much of anything. one of those two jokers decided steve\\'s performance was best served by doing a bad marlon brando imitation. this film may go down as the worst ever done by steve mcqueen. i\\'m willing to bet that dick powell and four star productions had already signed him for wanted dead or alive because i can\\'t believe they would have if they saw this. or they would have seen something the public would have overlooked except for the dressing for this turkey. this is a bad film, as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of merging several disparate scripts. as a result, it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film miss dunne or mr. huston should have been proud of making. however, the film is worth watching if you are a fan of \"pre-code\" films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls do put out--even if they aren\\'t married and even if their partner is!! the film begins with miss dunne as a social worker assisting troops heading to europe for wwi. in the process, she meets a scalawag (bruce cabot) who eventually convinces her to sleep with him. she becomes pregnant and he then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman. however, miss dunne does not want him back, as she realizes he\\'s not worth it, but later her baby dies at child birth. while all these very controversial plot elements are used, they are always alluded to--almost like they wanted the adults in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way, kids in the audience will be clueless (after all, films were not rated and kids might attend any film at this time). surprisingly, this entire plot involving a stillborn baby and cabot ends about 1/4 of the way through the film and is never mentioned again or alluded to. it was as if they filmed part of a movie and abandoned it--tacking it on to still another film. in this second phase of the film, miss dunne unexpectedly begins working at a women\\'s prison (though we actually never really get to see her doing anything there). what we do see are countless horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate. and, as a result of all this violence, miss dunne goes on a crusade to clean up the prison and becomes a reformer and famous writer. but then, out of the blue, another type of film emerges and the women\\'s prison reform business goes by the wayside. dunne meets a judge (walter huston) who is married but he desperately wants her. now throughout the film, dunne is portrayed as a very good girl--even though she did have unmarried sex with cabot (she was more or less tricked into it). but now, single irene, who is a tireless reformer and good lady begins sleeping with a married man. he tells her that he and his wife are estranged and are married in name only, but she never thinks to investigate if this is true, and with his assurance, off flies her clothes and they are in the baby making business! but, while she\\'s pregnant with his love child, he\\'s indicted for being a crooked judge. he assures her he\\'s innocent, but he\\'s convicted and it sure sounds like he\\'s a scoundrel--using inside information from people that have come before his bench in order to amass a fortune. then, in the final moments of the film, miss dunne tries in vain to get him freed and vows to wait with the child until huston is released. the film then ends. so, we basically have three separate films and a bizarre early 30s idea of what a nice girl should be like. i gathered that she should be a strong-minded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships! this really undoes all the positives about dunne\\'s character and it\\'s really hard to imagine anyone liking the film. a strong women\\'s rights advocate might easily be offended at how weak-minded and needy she was and religious people might see her as totally amoral or at least morally suspect! with a decent re-write, this could have been a good film or at least interesting as a lewd and salacious film, but it couldn\\'t make up its mind what it wanted to be and was just another dull pre-code film. i caught this movie on the sci-fi channel recently. it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as b-list horror/suspense films go. two guys (one naive and one loud mouthed a**) take a road trip to stop a wedding but have the worst possible luck when a maniac in a freaky, make-shift tank/truck hybrid decides to play cat-and-mouse with them. things are further complicated when they pick up a ridiculously whorish hitchhiker. what makes this film unique is that the combination of comedy and terror actually work in this movie, unlike so many others. the two guys are likable enough and there are some good chase/suspense scenes. nice pacing and comic timing make this movie more than passable for the horror/slasher buff. definitely worth checking out. (very mild spoilers; a basic plot outline, no real details) if you go into this movie with sufficiently low expectations. i saw this film at a free screening a few days ago in maryland, and the only reason i agreed to go...was because it was free. i expected a few chuckles, but as i have never been a huge fan of tenacious d, not much more then that. the first ten minutes of the film are hilarious, as we are given a look at jack black\\'s humble christian origins in a midwest american town. the film then takes us years into the future, to the first meeting between jb and kyle gass, the second half of tenacious d. we see the formation of the band and the genesis of its name. finally, as the title suggests, the second half of the film details their quest to obtain the fabled \"pick of destiny.\" again, the beginning of the film was laugh out loud funny, and most of the movie at least kept a smile on my face. that said, there were times it felt a bit long; it\\'s only 100 minutes, but it still felt like it should have been a bit shorter. the story is every bit as absurd as it sounds, and this is not a film you see if you want a real plot. which is fine, except it means that many of the jokes are very hit or miss...and when they miss, they miss bad. same thing with the songs; it is a musical, but many of the songs lost their appeal after the first minute or so...then kept going anyway. i will say that the r-rating really saved this movie from bombing; the d\\'s humor simply couldn\\'t work without cussing, sex, and drug references. but unless you\\'re a real fan of the band, or at the very least know you appreciate their style of comedy, i would recommend you save yourself some money and rent. \"pick\" will make you giggle a bit...but is it worth 9 bucks? i don\\'t think so. i was tempted to rate it a 6, but since i do think that many would enjoy it enough to justify seeing it in theatres, a 7 seems more appropriate. just be sure it\\'s your style. i shall begin with a disclaimer: this movie is not recommended for anyone who lack interest or have never played ff7 the game before watching. the movie relies on the audience\\'s knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements. and it does so very subtly. do your homework before watching this wonderful piece of cg film and i promise it\\'ll be that much better. with that in mind, this film has some of the most spectacular cg sequences i have ever witnessed. the whole experience felt like an extra long fmv sequence from the game, on steroids. yeah. the attention to detail in each scene, especially in the heavy action oriented ones, is so impeccable it left me with a sense of awe. i believe the soundtrack is simplified so as to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music. again, for those who are familiar with the ff7 story and background, the music should not surprise anyone (although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhances the animation). once again, i myself having only played through ff7 once, thoroughly enjoyed this piece of art from square enix. and that is the feel in most scenes, choreographed and organized. like a dance. in short, if you enjoyed the music or the game final fantasy 7, this film will blow you out of the water. if you\\'re in the unfortunate majority who has not experienced the goodness known as ff7 on playstation or pc, doing so before watching the movie will allow for an exponentially greater experience. finally, i just want to make a note of the quality in animating this film. characters move with fluidity. each scene background comes to life and tells its own story. for those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the story plot, i urge you to reexamine the animation. facial reactions, subtle clues that bring about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot delivery. square enix and the great tetsuya nomura has set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling. advent children has ushered in a new era for cg animations, allowing the subtleties that lie in each character to speak volumes in and of themselves. thanks square enix. the wait was well worth it. this is quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made. everything about it--acting, directing, script, cinematography--is dreadful. the alien (a human in sparkly suit) claims to be from a nearby universe; one assumes the scriptwriter meant \"galaxy\" but didn\\'t bother to get a dictionary to check his terms. a better title for the film would be \"it came from the planet of plot contrivances.\" the plot is excessively silly and nearly nonexistent. the humans are all given magical macguffins that conform to a tortuous series of unlikely restrictions just to move the bare plot. any thought to the passage of time is ignored. now it\\'s a couple days after meeting the alien, then bam! all of a sudden there\\'s only a couple hours left until zero hour. do yourself a favor and miss this movie. you will make yourself stupider for having watched it. the ending is particularly silly, and should have been accompanied by someone going \"ta-da!!!!\" as the scriptwriter just pulls something random out of his butt. i think the real alien plot is that this movie sucks so bad you\\'ll get cancer watching it. if you can watch the last 10 minutes without crapping yourself (\"enemies of freedom\"--honestly) laughing, you\\'re retarded. if you really really really enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt-mirrors, eating non-ants, and conquering the world with a voice-over narrative, then this is the movie for you. basically, a couple of scientists working out of a bio-dome communicate with highly intelligent ants (the most intelligent actors in this film) in an attempt to try to thwart their plans of conquest and extermination. throughout the movie the two scientists (and a girl they rescued from the ants) use everything at their disposal (computers, green dye, and horrid acting), but to no avail. i guess they just couldn\\'t afford any pesticides because the movie would be over too quickly. the title of the movie \"phase iv\" is something of a mystery. this is not a spoiler, but \"phase i\" starts right after the opening credits whereas you don\\'t reach \"phase iv\" until the end credits roll. apparently the director knew the movie would be tedious to get through and so placed phases 1 - 3 throughout the movie as a kind of progress report: \"hang in there buddy! only 1 more phase until final credits!\" as a mst3k episode, this one wasn\\'t very good for two reasons: 1) this one is from the season 0 on ktma when they were first starting out so the riffing is not as good as in later seasons; and 2) this movie is so bad not even j&tb can lighten it up. there are one or two gamera references as they had just finished riffing 5 gamera movies. the movie does have a trick/surprise ending, but i was so glad to reach the end the effect was lost on me. joseph brady and clarence doolittle are two sailors, who have a four-day shore leave in hollywood.joe knows everything about girls and can\\'t wait to see lola, while clarence is shyer and needs some advice from his buddy on how to meet girls.they then run into a little boy, donald martin, who has ran away in order to join the navy.they take him home and meet his beautiful aunt susan, who wants to be a singer.clarence wants susie to be his girl, but his shyness gets in the way.but he doesn\\'t feel shy with a waitress, who comes from brooklyn, like he does.soon joe notices he\\'s in love with susie.the boys are in a fix when they lie to susie on meeting with a big time music producer they don\\'t even know.as they are in a fix with their feelings.george sidney\\'s anchors aweigh (1945) is a great musical comedy.gene kelly is top-notch, once again, in his singing and dancing routines.frank sinatra is terrific as the shy guy from brooklyn.shy isn\\'t the first thing that comes to mind when you think of frank sinatra, but he plays his part well.kathryn grayson is fantastic as susan abbott.we sadly lost this gifted actress and operatic soprano singer last month at the age of 88.the 9-year old dean stockwell does amazing job as the little fellow wanting to become a sailor.jose iturbi does great job performing himself.it\\'s magic what he does with the piano.edgar kennedy plays chief of police station.sara berner is the voice of jerry mouse.there\\'s a lot of great stuff in this movie and some fantastic singing and dancing numbers.just look at kelly and sinatra performing \"we hate to leave\".it\\'s so energetic.\"if you knew susie (like i know susie)\" is quite funny.it\\'s a nice moment when frank sings brahms\\' lullaby to little dean stockwell.it\\'s lovely to listen to grayson singing the tango \"jealousy\" .the most memorable sequence is the one that takes into the animated fantasy world, and there gene sings and dances with jerry mouse.also tom cat is seen there as the butler.they originally asked mickey mouse but he refused.the movie was nominated for five oscars but georgie stoll got one for original music score.anchors aweigh is some high class entertainment. from director barbet schroder (reversal of fortune), i think i saw a bit of this in my media studies class, and i recognised the leading actress, so i tried it, despite the rating by the critics. basically cool kid richard haywood (half nelson\\'s ryan gosling) and justin pendleton (bully\\'s michael pitt) team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them. investigating the murder is homicide detective cassie \\'the hyena\\' mayweather (sandra bullock) with new partner sam kennedy (ben chaplin), who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene, e.g. non-relating hairs. the plan doesn\\'t seem to be completely going well because cassie and sam do quite quickly have richard or justin as suspects, it is just a question of if they can sway them away. also starring agnes bruckner as lisa mills, chris penn as ray feathers, r.d. call as captain rod cody and tom verica as asst. d.a. al swanson. i can see now the same concept as sir alfred hitchcock\\'s rope with the murdering for a challenge thing, but this film does it in a very silly way, and not even a reasonably good bullock can save it from being dull and predictable. adequate! things to come is an early sci-fi film that shows an imagined world, or \"everytown\" through 100 years. you can break it up into about 4 different scenes or parts. the film spans from 1940 to 2036 and is mainly about how this ruler or the \"boss\" wanted to get the capability to fly in airplanes again, after everytown was bombed and war broke out. this film only has about 3 faults: it\\'s audio is muddy and video had some quirks, the characters aren\\'t deep at all, and the overall plot isn\\'t altogether solid. the plot is lacking something that i can\\'t put my finger on... it just seems a little \"fluffy.\" but if you love sci-fi and are interested in what h.g. wells though might happened in the next hundred years, this is a must see. it\\'s worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing: a long, drawn-out war, because they were just about to go to war with germany, and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything. things to come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once. weak,stale, tired, cliched; wants to be basic instinct, but misses opportunity after opportunity for fresh perspectives, new insights. insipid, trite, grotesque, and without the possibly-redeeming value of brevity; oh, wait...it was only 90 minutes long...it must have just *seemed* a lot longer! i\\'d rather clean bus station toilets with my toothbrush than have to sit through this again. i\\'m expressing an opinion here: i guess this means i didn\\'t like it. one word can describe this movie and that is weird. i recorded this movie one day because it was a japanese animation and it was old so i thought it would be interesting. well it was, the movie is about a young boy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge. on the way he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide if he wants the body or not. very strange, if you are a fan of animation/science-fiction you might want to check this out. while i was the video store i was browsing through the one dollar rentals and came upon this little gem. i don\\'t know what it was about it but i just had a gut instic about it and wow was i ever right. the story centers around two girls who have just survived a school shooting. one of the girls is alicia a teenage reble who is the only witness for the full attack and another is deanna another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by some miracle. thrown together by fate, they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving on. i just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks. because wow what a performance by busy phillips and erkia christensen not to mention the rest of the cast! my only complaint is that the dvd was sorely lacking in special features. oh and some of the jump cuts in the movie were kind of jarring. but all in all a excellent movie. this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning indictment on not only the british film industry but the talentless hacks at work today. not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features a good cast of british actors, so what went wrong? i don\\'t know and simply i don\\'t care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all. be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish. but apparently i need to write ten lines of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot. a nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and co-worker out of his father\\'s company and thus leads to an encounter with the russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid, very stupid plot twists/devices. i should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience. if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather, what about lock, stock.... thats the peak of the contemporary british crime film..... i\\'ll not comment a lot, what\\'s to??? stereotype characters, absolute ignorance about colombia\\'s reality, awful mise en scene, poor color choice, not funny (it supposed to be a comedy and they expect that you will laugh because some distend music it\\'s beside the nonsense scenes), very poor actors direction (if you see somewhere those people, i mean the interpreters, you\\'ll know they are at least good, but seeing this so call film, it is impossible to guess it), you get tired of the music... this \"comedy\" has no rhythm, the only good rhythm in it, it\\'s the rap sing in the final credits....pathetic, doesn\\'t it? etc...etc... it has been a long time i haven\\'t seen a movie so bad!! this movie is a riot. i cannot remember the last time i had such a great time at the movies. i\\'ve seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny. but this one is wall to wall great lines. i think best in show is the last movie that i laughed so hard and so much in. the movie was non-stop until the end when they did the 5 minutes of sentimental plot clean up. other than that it\\'s a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations. i\\'d like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the zucker movies where you don\\'t get all the jokes the first time around. you have to see it two or three times to get it all in. as far as the actual film goes, it could have used a better edit, it\\'s choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that. all the characters are great. it\\'s not like an adam sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke. i think i will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable. no victims in this movie. also, thank god they got a 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend. catherine keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film. you just wish that women like her really existed. she\\'s not a \"10\" like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than julia roberts overdone overbite. if you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it. i assure you, the trailer does not do it justice. they do not give away all the good jokes. just some of the mediocre ones. oh and one more thing. i hope critics put this on their top ten list. many of them complain that comedies don\\'t get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they don\\'t put it on their list. this means you ebert!!! a fey story of a martian attempt to colonize earth. (things must be pretty bad back on mars.) two state troopers investigate the scene of a reported ufo crash. whatever landed is buried under the ice at tracy\\'s pond but there are footsteps in the snow leading to a nearby diner. the diner has had no customers since eleven o\\'clock that morning. now there are a handful of bus passengers sitting around waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge. the bus driver insists that six passengers were aboard the bus, although he didn\\'t notice who they were. the problem is that there are now seven people waiting for the journey to be resumed. one of them is an alien, but which one? all of them are suspect. there\\'s the crazy old man (jack elam), of course, who seems to exercise a sub rosa wit. there\\'s a blustering businessman who must get to boston (john hoyt). a young couple on their honeymoon. (execrable performance by the husband, ron kipling.) except for the couples, nobody has noticed anyone else. and even the couples are suspicious of each other. bride to newly minted husband: \"i could have sworn you had a mole on your chin.\" the story continues in a sprightly but slightly spooky way -- the phone rings for no reason, the lights go on and off, the juke box turns itself on -- and none of it is to be taken seriously. it\\'s a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble play and the climactic revelation is worth a chuckle. there is no discernible \"depth\" to it. it\\'s not a moral message about pod people masquerading as normal citizens. it\\'s not a warning of any kind, just a fairy tale that diverts and amuses. i always enjoy it when it\\'s on. it\\'s especially interesting to see john hoyt as the irritable and impatient businessman, knowing that in 1954 he was the roman senator who masterminded the assassination of julius caesar in mgm\\'s version of shakespeare\\'s play. and here he is -- with three arms. oops. it\\'s rare that i feel a need to write a review on this site, but this film is very deserving because of how poorly it was created, and how bias its product was. i felt a distinct attempt on the part of the film-makers to display the palestinian family as boorish and untrustworthy. we hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression, yet the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the jewish israeli population. we see no evidence that parallels the position of the palestinian teenager. we only hear from other palestinians in prison. i understand restrictions are in place, but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peace. i came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence, so to speak. she continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bomber\\'s parents, and her angry and closed-minded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control. it is more realistic, in my mind, to see the israeli mindset to be a root of the problem; ignored pleas for understanding and freedom, ignored requests for acknowledgment for the process by which the jewish population acquired the land. i have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother, which normally would be admirable in a documentary, however in the light of the lack of impartiality, it all seems exploitative. also for the poor edits, lack of background in the actual instance, and finally the lack of proper representation of the palestinian side. ultimately, it is a poor documentary and a poor film. i acknowledge this is partially the result of the political situation, but am obliged to note the flaws in direction regardless of the heart-wrenching and sad subject matter. relentless like one of those loud action movies. the entire cast seems to be on speed. i didn\\'t quite get the director\\'s intentions if any. i wonder if she\\'s ever seen a stanley donen, vincent minnelli or even a george sidney musical. structure, please! this is one hell of a mess and i loved abba. the costumes the unflattering photography - unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations) the one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of meryl streep making a fool of herself. no chemistry with her friends (christine baranski and julie walters) think of streep with lily tomlyn in the altman film and you\\'ll understand what i was hoping for. i was embarrassed in particular by pierce brosnam and colin firth. the audience, however, seemed to enjoy it so it probably it\\'s just me. this movie does a great job of explaining the problems that we faced and the fears that we had before we put man into space. as a history of space flight, it is still used today in classrooms that can get one of the rare prints of it. disney has shown it on \"vault disney\" and i wish they would do so again. in an alternate 1950s, where an outbreak of the undead (caused by a mysterious \\'space-dust\\') has been contained through the use of special electronic collars, a young loner, timmy, finds a friend in fido (billy connelly), his family\\'s recently acquired domesticated zombie. fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to timmy, whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son (or for his hot-to-trot wife, played by the gorgeous carrie-anne moss) having been psychologically scarred as a child (when he was forced to shoot his own father, who tried to eat him!). timmy runs into a spot of bother, however, when his putrid pal\\'s collar goes on the blink, and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour. with the authorities on fido\\'s trail, trouble brewing with a pair of local bullies, and his mother forming a bond with their undead house-help, will timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend? a refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick, fido is a thoroughly entertaining, deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour. taking the romero zombie-verse and transplanting it into 1950s small town america is a stroke of genius, and the result is simply one of the most original films to tackle the whole \\'reanimated dead\\' theme that i have seen. connelly\\'s fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the undead movie hall of fame, along with day of the dead\\'s bub, and return of the living dead\\'s tarman; it is not often i feel empathy for a walking corpse, but the big yin\\'s performance is so fine that i actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of pus! the rest of the cast also give commendable performances, with young k\\'sun ray (as timmy) and ms.moss deserving special mentionsâ—ray, because, for one so young, he puts in a particularly assured turn, and moss because she is so bloody yummy! this is the third zombie film that i have watched this week (the others being the somewhat disappointing planet terror and the rather fun flight of the living dead), and, to my surprise, it is also the best. director andrew currie has given fans of the genre something truly original to treasure and is a talent to be watched in the future. 8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for imdb. an extremely down-to-earth, well made and acted \"rodeo\" western. no gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60\\'s and 70\\'s west. but hats off particularly to slim pickens for giving what i think was his signature performance, especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life. his role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the \"ups and downs\" of the hard-nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style. he and mr. coburn teamed up extremely well as partners, not only on the circuit itself, but also in the real world outside the corral. also, check out anne archer as coburn\\'s native american love interest in the latter part of the movie. must have been one of her first roles. not as flashy, perhaps, as \"junior bonner\", but equally heart rendering and impacting in its portrayal. thanks to the encore western channel for showing this true grit of an under-rated movie from time to time. despite some reviews being distinctly luke-warm, i found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as \\'mills and boon\\', so what? it is good to see a warm, touching story of real love in these cynical times. many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes. you really believe that the young victoria and albert are passionately fond of each other, even though, for political reasons, it was an arranged marriage. i did feel though that sir john conroy, who was desperate to control the young queen, is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain. as it is rumoured that he was in fact, the real father of victoria (as a result of an affair with her mother the duchess of kent) it would have been interesting to explore this theory. emily blunt is totally convincing as the young princess, trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her. she brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made victoria a great queen of england, which prospered as never before, under her long reign. i believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie. \"american nightmare\" is officially tied, in my opinion, with \"it\\'s pat!\" for the worst movie of all time. seven friends (oddly resembling the k-mart version of the cast of \"friends\") gather in a coffee shop to listen to american nightmare, a pirate radio show. it\\'s hosted by a guy with a beard. that\\'s the most exciting aspect of his show. chandler, monica, joey, and... oh wait, i mean, wayne, jessie, and the rest of the bad one-liner spouting gang all take turns revealing their biggest fears to the bearded dj. unbeknownst to them, a crazed nurse/serial killer is listening... crazy nurse then proceeds to torture ross and rachel and... wait, sorry again... by making their fears come to life. these fears include such stunners as \"voodoo\" and being gone down on by old ladies with dentures. no. really. this movie was, in a word, rotten. crazy nurse\\'s killing spree lacks motivation, there\\'s nothing to make the viewer \"jump,\" the ending blows, and--again--voodoo? if you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones, rent \"american nightmare\" with them. if you care for your loved ones--even a little bit--go to your local blockbuster, rent all of the copies of \"american nightmare\" and hide them in your freezer. first off, i have to say that i loved the book animal farm. i read it with my 9th grade class, and it was great. we also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial. the movie was so disappointing to me. the movie cuts out some characters, and misses a lot of the main points of the book. it skips around a lot, and doesn\\'t explain anything in detail. if someone was watching this movie without having first read the book, they would be confused. the most disappointing thing in this movie to me, was the ending. the ending in the book was the most powerful, and in the movie, they changed it! it was supposed to be the pigs and men in an alliance and sort of \"melting\" together, but instead, the movie made it seem like the animals were going to rebel against the pigs. to sum up, i don\\'t think that this movie captured the real meaning that orwell portrayed in his book. this movie was extremely boring. i only laughed a few times. i decided to rent it when i noticed william shatner\\'s name on the cover. it\\'s all about this little kid who gets picked on all the time by his classmates. when wandering the streets looking for old ladies to assist, he meets a prostitute. she takes him to a club called the playground, where he befriends several pimps. when mayor tony gold (shatner) decides to take over the pimp business, lil\\' pimp must lay down for his homies. the animation isn\\'t very good in this. it looks like it was made with macromedia, which i\\'m sure it was. it doesn\\'t suck, it\\'s just the sort of choppy flash animation that people have gotten used to over recent years. the humor in this is not very good, i didn\\'t think any of it was funny. i was disgusted by this movie. no it wasn\\'t because of the graphic sex scenes, it was because it ruined the image of artemisia gentileschi. this movie does not hold much truth about her and her art. it shows one piece of art work that she did (judith beheading holofernese) but shows that being entered as testimony in the rape trial when she did not paint her first judith for a year after the trial. i don\\'t know if you understood this from the movie, probably not, tassi was not a noble character. he raped artemisia. it was not love, it was rape. he did not claim to accept false charges of rape to stop her from suffering while she was tortured. according to the rape transcripts he continued to claim that he never carnally knew artemisia (aka had sex with) while she states over and over again \"it\\'s true\". i encourage all of you people to go out and find about the real artemisia and see what she is really about. don\\'t base all of your knowledge on this fictional movie. i encourage you to do some research, artemisia really does have interesting story behind her and some amazing art work. don\\'t see the movie, but find out the true story of artemisia. such a joyous world has been created for us in pixar\\'s a bug\\'s life; we\\'re immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film, but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation. for those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer â– when it\\'s in the right hands that is â– a bug\\'s life is a warm reminder. we walk out of the film with an equally-warm feeling, and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high-calibre film productions. it is only pixar\\'s second animated feature. the sub-group of disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in 1995, with their landmark movie toy story. it was a movie which defied convention, re-invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence. now, they return with their sophomore effort which, to be honest, draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film. after all, it\\'s a film about ants. well, all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in a bug\\'s life, but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film, as humans are the focal point in dramas, romances and so on. how can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie, let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film? surely they jest. however, we forget that in toy story, a bunch of toy-box items were able to become the grandest, most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted. the guys at pixar manage to pull off the same feat, and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you\\'ll probably ever encounter. not only are they all entirely amiable and likable â– there isn\\'t an unpleasant character in sight; even the villains are riveting characters â– but they\\'re colourful, they\\'re eclectic, and they\\'re idiosyncratic. and the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term, only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto a bug\\'s life from the beginning. we shall start with our main character, and our hero. his name is flik (david foley), and his character is rather generic to say the least. out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush, beautiful ant island, he is the one considered the \\'black sheep\\' of the clan, as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season\\'s harvest with his antics. the problem arises in the fact that the ants\\' harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by hopper (kevin spacey), who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants; when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone, they go insane, for lack of a better term. hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack\\'s hands; however, it\\'s a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil. the cogs and clockwork in flik\\'s mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame, and he offers to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colony\\'s rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppers. if you think about it, a bug\\'s life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot line\\'s of akira kurosawa\\'s classic seven samurai, or the american remake the magnificent seven, in which a village of hapless but good-hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies â– one lone village-dweller goes in search for help in the big city, finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil. in a bug\\'s life, the help comes in the form of a down-and-out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by flik as warriors in a bar-room brawl. much amusement comes out of these scenes, and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs. among them are an erudite stick insect (david hyde pierce), a side-splitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and a quasi-femme fatale ladybug who\\'s in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug (dennis hopper). it\\'s exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on-screen, as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on-screen, as is the entire movie collectively. as i\\'ve said, much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another, which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines, wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie. what makes a bug\\'s life even better is that the film isn\\'t restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be, although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film â– the clichã©d kid-friendly situations are a bit more abundant than we\\'d like. however, it\\'s easy to ignore this fault, and it\\'s incredulously easy to enjoy this film. although a bug\\'s life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor, this is still a superb movie, and the start of something promising here. pixar have proved that they\\'re not just a one-hit wonder, but instead a much-gifted and talented group of film artists in hollywood. they raise the bar endlessly, and when someone always manages to top their standards, it\\'s only always by themselves. what more is there to say about a bug\\'s life other than: see it; it\\'s not quite the best which we\\'ve seen from the folks at emeryville, california, but this beats out the lot of its year â– and i\\'ll be damned if this isn\\'t the best animated feature of 1998. 8.5/10 what an empty and lack lustre rendition of the classic novel. i do wish people would stop messing about with classics when they clearly have no idea of the real intention or point of the original. this version is no different. i felt that the ralph fiennes version is much worse though as the casting of juliette brioche as kathy has got to be the worst casting decision ever...anyway back to this version. it aims to make the story relevant to a contemporary setting and in a musical style. it succeeds in both but high art it is nit. throwaway viewing for a rainy day maybe...the direction was average and the editing abysmal. worse than the old quincy. deepak verma does a great turn as hindley and is in fact one of britains wasted talents. the part of heath was played with great charm and belief and i think that the casting is the strongest point of this project. although a more talented director would have made better use of the facilities he had. its clear that he was a director for hire and didn\\'t instill the project with the passion that it deserved. my father the hero used to be my favorite movie when i was younger. it\\'s about andre, a divorced french man who wants to take his beautiful daughter (katharine heigl} on a vacation, hoping to get a little closer to her. but of course, nicole isn\\'t that easy to get along with, she just started puberty, i\\'m guessing. she is angry and hurt that her father was never there for her and decides to give him a hard time. one day at the beach, nicole meets handsome ben, and she makes up a wild story about her and her dad. the whole island gets involved and the movie turns into a hilarious wild entertaining movie. i would give my father the hero 8/10 it is surprising that a production like this gets made these days, especially for television. considering the strong sexual themes and explicit lovemaking scenes, not to mention lesbianism, this has been given superb treatment and direction. the sets and costumes are flawless, the direction is stylish and the characters are likeable. there is a fair amount of humor but it has surprisingly dark interludes. the protagonist is really a tragic figure, but not devoid of happiness. also, this production avoids the mistake most films/shows make when dealing with homosexuality/lesbianism. the characters are very human. it seems that to allow people to be comfortable with watching gays and lesbians on tv and movies most shows fill it full of cliches and make the characters obsessed with being gay. not so with this. in tipping the velvet, the protagonist is hardly aware of what being lesbian means! the bbc have made some wonderful productions in the past, and this adventurous period piece only confirms their standard of excellence on all fronts. i just don\\'t get some of the big premises of this episode - that miranda is so remarkable, and that there\\'s anything so ugly it would make you insane. someone here made the remark that maybe it\\'s the frequency of the light waves or something rather than it being ugliness. miranda is just a jerk. the episode is slow, inconsistent and way too talky. i also don\\'t quite understand why kolos is an ambassador - why doesn\\'t the federation just leave the damn medusans be? there\\'s one part i do like, when kolos is speaking through spock about the loneliness of the human experience. overall, i love tos and even at its lamest, i\\'ll always tune in. this episode though - mmm, i wouldn\\'t purchase it except for a used copy under $3. this is one of my all time favorite movies and i would recommend it to anyone. on my list of favorite movies (mental list, mind) the only ones on par with it are movies such as the lord of the rings series, spirited away and fly away home. i can really relate to the main character jess. at the start of the movie she\\'s a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls. she really sucks you into her life. i also certainly can\\'t fault any of the protagonist\\'s acting, or anyone else\\'s in the film. the soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules. the movie is never boring. the romance is really cute and didn\\'t make me blush tooooo hard! one thing that really made it though was the indian factor. jess\\' parents are indian and there are many colourful indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else. the indian people are also hilarious! essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it. feel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film. they\\'re funny, they\\'re refreshing and they make you feel good! ^_~ i know that you\\'ve already entered this in film festivals (or at least i think you have, i may just be making that up) but i think this should get \"best animated short film\" in every one. bravo. i can\\'t wait for the full film. i realize that you may not hear this often enough because of the bizarre nature of your animations, but hear it now and accept it as the truth. kudos, my friend. okay, now i\\'m just trying to get ten lines of text... though i still mean it. and here comes yet another -shoe!- and i cannot stop here yet. this is extremely annoying and yet at the same time i have nothing better to do. in fact, i\\'ll probably watch all of your movies in yet another spasmodic \"jason steele marathon.\" i do have a lot of those. -r this is probably the first entry in the \"lance o\\'leary/nurse keat\" detective series; in subsequent o\\'leary films, he was played by much younger actors than guy kibbee. a group of relatives (all played by well-known character actors) gathers in an old house (on a rainy nite, of course!) to speak to a wealthy relative, who goes into a coma. while they wait for him to recover, all sorts of mysterious goings-on happen, including a couple of murders. a creepy film; worth seeing! this animation has a very simple and straightforward good vs. evil plot and is all about action. what sets it apart from other animation is how well the human movements are animated. it was really beautiful seeing the fleeing woman running around on the screen from left to right and look around, her movements were done so well. why don\\'t they use this rotoscopic technique more these days? it\\'s quite effective. fire and ice, in it\\'s prehistoric setting and scarcely dressed women, was clearly devoted to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy ways, her voluptuous body serving as pure eyecandy. some may hate this and regard it as yet another moronic male sexual fantasy, others (including plenty of women) will adore it\\'s esthetic quality. i for sure did not mind! bakshi just loves animating lushious, voluptuous babes, as can also be seen in cool world, and i don\\'t think he has to apoligize since it\\'s pretty much animation for adults. but i had also enjoyed this animation as a child and i never forgot it. this one was just special, so different from the standard disney or anime fare, and for that reason alone well worth the watch since it\\'s possibly bakshi\\'s finest. for those who like animations with lushious women: try space adventure cobra as well. i give fire and ice 8 out of 10. my ratings: acting - 3/10 suspense - 2/10 character attachment - 1/10 plot - 2/10 character development - 2/10 overall - 2/10 this show sucks very much officially. for me, csi miami is the best, csi ny 2nd and csi 100th. i don\\'t know, in the other csis you get into the episode you\\'re watching. but in this one, you just can\\'t get into the episode, no matter how much you try, so in my opinion, this show is not worth watching. i know people have different opinions, and i respect that, but for me, this csi ain\\'t good enough. so if you like suspense, real acting/performance, good plot, direction, character development/attachment and you an overall good show, i suggest you to watch csi miami. i am not a faulkner fan (which is considered sacrilegious, especially since i grew up near the author\\'s hometown); however, i think this is an excellent movie. on par with the quality of the movie \"to kill a mocking bird\". if you haven\\'t seen it, buy it anyway. it\\'s well worth having in your permanent collection. tcm recently played the movie as a part of the race on film series. i wish they\\'d play it more often. very moving. on a side note, the folks from oxford, mississippi, will also enjoy seeing the footage of the town square as it was back in the 1940\\'s. the courthouse, city hall, etc.: they\\'re all on screen. i never knew the movie was filmed there until i noticed the familiarity of the buildings. when i saw the arch in the front of city hall, i began to get suspicious. look closely at the pennants on chick\\'s wall: you\\'ll see two for ole miss ! chinese ghost story iii is a totally superfluous sequel to two excellent fantasy films. the film delivers the spell-casting special effects that one can expect, but fails painfully on all other fronts. the actors all play extremely silly caricatures. you have to be still in diapers to find their slapstick humor even remotely funny. the plot is predictable, and the development is sometimes erratic and often slow. towards the end, the movie begins to resemble old godzilla films, including shabby larger-than-life special effects and a (well, yet another) ghost with a godzilla head. maybe i would have grinned if i was expecting camp. it is astonishing to see what trash fantasy fans have to put up with - in this case because somebody thought they could squeeze a little extra money out of a successful formula. they won\\'t be able to do it again: the cash cow is now dead as a dodo. i can\\'t stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with paris hilton, and sure it\\'s his company. but \"you\\'re fired\" or \"you\\'re hired\", for how many seasons now? after watching the show i wouldn\\'t want to work for the guy with his ego and all and i think watching paint dry has more entertainment valve. i\\'d love to hear just one person get up and say \"donald i quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo\". i see he\\'s even trying to buy fame in the wrestling wwe. i hope he gets hurt so i don\\'t have to see his pathetic face anymore. it must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it. i\\'d give this show a negative mark if i could but it gets a 1 and it doesn\\'t deserve that. if i had known this movie was filmed in the exasperating and quease-inducing dogme 95 style, i would never have rented it. nevertheless, i took a dramamine for the seasickness and gave it a shot. i lasted a very, very, very long forty minutes before giving up. it\\'s just boring, pretentious twaddle. the last french movie i saw was \"romance\" and it too was pretty dismal, but at least the camera was steady and not breathing down the necks of the characters all the time. i am baffled at the continuing popularity of dogme 95 overseas -- it\\'ll catch on in america about the same time as the next big outbreak of leprosy. (it\\'s called dogme 95 because that\\'s the average number of times the actors are poked in the eye by the camera.) the story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and i hate depressing movies. ri\\'chard is great. he really put on a top notch performance, and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous. seriously, i thought she was carmen electra until i saw the imdb profile. i can\\'t say anything bad about peter galleghar. he\\'s one of my favorite actors. i love anne rice. i\\'m currently reading the vampire chronicles, but i\\'m glad i saw the movie before reading the book. this is a little too\"real\" for me. i prefer lestat and louis\\'s witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves. eartha kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did the movie was ruined for me; i could barely stand to watch the rest of the show. (sorry for the ambiguity, but i don\\'t want to give anything away) sorry, but it\\'s just not my type of show. first, let me just comment on what i liked about the movie. the special effects were fantastic, and very rarely did i feel like i was watching a video game. there, that is the last nice thing i have to say about this film. in fact, i would just like everyone reading this to take note that i can\\'t even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing. i have innumerable complaints about the film, but four major complaints jump to mind. my first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the \"plot twist\" (if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away) where lois\\'s 5 year-old son turns out to be the super-powered child of superman. when the crying super-child throws a piano at lex\\'s henchman to save his mother, i almost got up and left the theater. singer could have made a much better superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but latently super-powered illegitimate child. it\\'s been 5 days since i saw the movie and i still want to vomit. my next major complaint has to do with the fact that superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space. it doesn\\'t take comic book guy from the simpsons to point out what\\'s wrong with that. i don\\'t know how many comic books brian singer has read, but when superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet. whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any superman-related projects ever again. the concept is as ridiculous as making a dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun. why not just have superman eat kryptonite? he can eat it and then brush his teeth with it, and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas. that\\'s not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in re-entry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground. my third major complaint has to do with the fact that singer slaps movie-goers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie. i have to take issue with his characterization of superman as the only son of a god-like jor-el sent to earth to be a savior. jor-el wasn\\'t all-wise, he was just a scientist. and he didn\\'t send his son to earth to be a savior, he threw him in a rocket and hurriedly fired it into space because his planet was about to explode. i\\'ll buy the christ allegory if brian singer can show me the part in the bible where god sends christ to earth because heaven was about to explode, and then radioactive pieces of heaven become christ\\'s primary weakness. furthermore, the \"crucifixion\" scene where luthor stabs superman in the side with a kryptonite \"spear\" just makes me want to slam my face into a brick until i\\'m too brain-dead to notice the brazenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be tainting the man of steel for the foreseeable future. they might as well rename this movie \"superman returns: the passion of the christ.\" and speaking of luthor, my last major complaint has to do with singer\\'s depiction of lex luthor. lex luthor is a shrewd, cold-hearted business tycoon who is more apt to run for president (which he does in the comics) than try to destroy the world. the man wants money and power; he wants to be in charge, not wreck everything. yet the luthor we see superman returns, as well as all the previous superman movies, is a wacky theatrical dunce who comes up with zany schemes to destroy the world. if singer had the slightest loyalty to the characters instead of the (quite awful) previous superman movies, this film might not be such an unbearable travesty. maybe singer\\'s next project can be a batman movie where he focuses on the interpretation of batman from 1960s tv show. zam! whap! pow!! to summarize, i don\\'t know what i hate more, the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good reviews. everyone is entitled to their opinion, but if you don\\'t hate this movie then your opinion is wrong. i sincerely encourage anyone who reads this not to see this movie if you haven\\'t already. don\\'t see it, don\\'t buy it when it comes out on dvd, don\\'t rent it...basically don\\'t contribute any money towards it in any way. this movie does not deserve to make any money. in fact, i think that for every person that sees this movie, bryan singer should be fined 45 billion dollars. if you\\'re a superman fan and you really want to see this movie, just bend over and have someone kick you in the balls and you\\'ll get the same experience without having to waste 2 hours of your time. this is one of the best tv productions of a musical ever. i have heard the merman cast album, the angela lansbury album, i have seen tyne daly live, and i\\'ve seen the rosalind russell movie countless times. i think bette is if not the best, then tied with the best. she captures not just the bravura, but also the pathos of mama rose. i was never a natalie wood fan, so i really enjoyed cynthia gibb, in what is arguably her best role. everything from the costumes to the sets to the supporting performances is wonderful. the three strippers, led by the always-dependable christine ebersole are hard to top. there was supposed to be a tv production of mame a few years back, with cher, but i think bette would be the best bet (pun intended) for auntie mame. i am sorry to say that this film is indeed bad. it reminds me of a c-grade porn movie with one major difference: no porn. the story and dialogue needs a complete overhaul. maybe then the bad acting would not have been as noticeable. at the very least, the pacing should have been picked up. while i accept that this had a low budget and the director did a good job visually given what little resources he had, he should have spent more time on the story or better yet, get someone else to write it. many of the action scenes were just pointless. it was a complete waste of my time. is it a perfect movie? no. it is a weird adaptation from a sci-fi book and it features vampires from space, naked beauties and the british army efficiency. when i first saw this movie i was rather young and all i can remember is the feeling of awe for the movie and mathilda may. actually, if it weren\\'t for this gorgeous lady being naked the whole movie, i probably wouldn\\'t have rated it so high, but given her sheer magnificence, i am now actually considering voting it up! lucky for me i got reminded of the movie and watched it again now. imagine raiders of the lost ark or poltergeist special effects splattered unto a rather decent sci-fi story, but with completely over the top performances. i still enjoyed the movie tremendously (as well as mathilda may), but it was a mixture of nostalgia, comparing with the crap movies they make today and actually wanting more when it ended. bottom line: if you are a sci-fi fan you are not allowed to miss this movie. oh, and did i mention mathilda may is young, beautiful and naked? overall i was rather impressed with the pilot. the initial first fifteen minutes were worrying, as it did feel the creators were trying to create a science fiction version of the o.c but this fear is rectified when a terrorist incident occurs and from here the show steps into themes and situations that i very rarely see television tackle. bsg dealt with themes such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death and terrorism but they were primarily subtext, there for the viewer to contemplate on or ignore if they so choose. here on the other hand these subjects are the focus of the show and i personally found myself evoking such works as ghost in the shell and the matrix as reference points while watching and being surprised by how well the themes were being discussed. i think if you are a fan of the two i just mentioned or other films/television shows, which deal with the subjects i referenced, i think you will find at least something here. in terms of a starting point to explain how the situation we know in bsg came about i believe they handled it in a very interesting way, i especially liked how they explained where the cylon\\'s belief in one god came from and the creation of caprica had just enough advanced and contemporary technology thrown in to make it appear in the future but not completely alien to us as viewers. the only real weak points i noticed were the relationship between the greystone parents and the actress who plays \\'lacy rand\\'. while i like eric stoltz and paula malcomson individually, together their scenes seemed to lack chemistry, at this point it could simply be down to developing their characters, but this is something i think needs work. i also found magda apanowicz to be unconvincing in her role. this again could be down to experience and time needed to develop, but throughout the episode her acting appeared forced and not completely confident. based on the pilot i greatly look forward to seeing where \\'caprica\\' goes in the future and hopefully it will touch the greatness that bsg once did. i\\'m the type of guy who loves hood movies from new jack city to baby boy to killa season, from the b grade to the hollywood. but this movie was something different. i am no hater and this movie was kinda enjoyable. but some bits were just weird. well the acting wasn\\'t to good, compared to silkk the shockers performance in hot boyz (quite good) and ice-t in new jack and svu (great). the scene where corrupt (ice-t) kills the wanna be jamaican dude he says something and lights himself on fire burning both ice-t and the other dude, this kills the jamaican, however ice-t is unharmed, very similar to ice\\'s other movie urban menace (which stars both of these actors) were snoops character is supernatural, however after this there is nothing suggested that corrupt is like a demon. when mj (silkk) gets stabbed at first he struggling but after that he fights normally and was stabbed in the thigh-with out blood. and when mj confesses killing a cop cos the cop was beating up his friend benny was weird, benny isn\\'t introduced in this movie and the scene isn\\'t in the film. it does hold weight to the fact why corrupt wants to kill mj but is still makes u scratch your head. wen jody writes a letter to miss jones character explaining what happened to them afterwords doesn\\'t mention what happen 2 other main characters mj and lisa. the film did show the horror and poverty of the ghetto-which plagues the lives of latinos and blacks word wide-was a good part of the film, even though the clip of the projects was re-used thousands of times. and the scene where miles kills the latino brother by crashing his bike at full speed (not wearing a helmet) and running into my latino brothers car would of killed him. the movie was similar to the film urban menace and half the actors were in both of these movies as well as the production team. it was ok tho. but me being from poverty i love hood films, however if u don\\'t love em like i do don\\'t watch it. only thing saving me from walking out is it reminded me of the first movie i made which was made with 100 dollars, and my love of the genre. nathaniel purez i am a huge fan of the farcry game, huge fan. it still holds a place in my top-10 games list of all time! the story line was new, fresh... a truly brilliant foundation to base a movie on... or so i thought... farcry the movie is no less than another directors attempt at cashing in on a successful game franchise (see doom: the movie, and many more...). the video game begins as the player (jack carver) awakes in a sea side cave after been shot off his boat by an rpg from an unknown soldier. jack then finds a communication device where (harlan doyle) guides him across islands, shipwrecks, jungles, installations and volcanoes, to find his (lady friend?) (valerie constantine), all the wile battling mutated super soldiers, and genetically enhanced animals. the movie plays out very, very differently: 1: there\\'s a needless 30 mins (1/3 of the movie) of \"backstory\" before we even get to the \\'boat blowing up\\' scene. 2: jack then walks onto the beach, kills some goons, then drives off... nothing like the game... 3: there is no communicator with doyle on the other end... 4: the \\'modified soldiers\\' look like albinos with singlets on... and there was no mutated \\'monkey-like\\' creatures jumping out of the bushes. a part of the farcry game i enjoyed allot... 5: there is no sun filled beach scenes, no aircraft carrier, no communications stations on huge cliffs, little reference to any in-game contents (characters/items/vehicles), in fact no attempt to follow the story line at all. 6: the climactic volcano scene from the game is replaced with an old industrial building. 7: there\\'s an ending scene... where everyone (except krieger) live happily ever after... what the! i recommend avoiding this movie at all costs! if you are a gamer, you will hate this movie will all your soul. it is a movie clearly intended for males, so girls, stay away... so if your a male, 12-29 years of age, have never played farcry, and are not disgusted by directors attempts at porting books/games to the cinema... then this is for you... one of the best ensemble acted films i\\'ve ever seen. there isn\\'t much to the plot, but the acting- incredible. you see the characters change ever so subtly, undr the influence of the rented villa in italy, and love. and happiness. the film casts a mesmerizing spell on you, much as the villa does on all the women. truly \"enchanted\". i haven\\'t seen this movie in about 5 years, but it still haunts me. when asked about my favorite films, this is the one that i seem to always mention first. there are certain films (works of art like this film, \"dark city\", and \"breaking the waves\") that seem to touch a place within you, a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive, that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer, not unlike a life-changing event, such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend... this film \"shook\" me when i first saw it. it left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days. today, i wrote this review in anger at uwe boll and hollywood. hollywood has produced movies based on one of the darkest days of our nation. 911 changed everything. it changed our perception of security. it changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity. most importantly and devastatingly , it changed our world. however, i can\\'t not stress how utterly repulsed, disillusioned, and angry i am at the careless, blatant ignorance of hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction. this film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid word-of-mouth among moviegoers and critics alike; most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press. hollywood has sunk to a new low. even lower than the low-down bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty. behind it all is uwe boll. i am very angry at this movie. how dare they disrespect the memories of families of those lost? how dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of infamy?!?!? how dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post-911 world?!?!?! how...dare...they? to those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty, i say this with a heavy heart with all my strength: remember. think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person. think back to that day, ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the lives lost on that day. think back to that day of the outcry of families of loved ones. think back to that day of the lives lost on those two planes. think back to the further carnage it caused following the attacks. ask yourself if you have a soul. think. remember. respect the memories of the lives lost on 911 by not seeing this film at all. you cannot deny that we have an affinity for speed. that\\'s why movies like fast and the furious, dhoom, rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audiences, especially local ones. we live on a tiny island, and i cannot fathom why, for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system, most of us want to get into debt by owning a set of wheels which come with 100% tax when they reach our shores, and the myriad of taxes and bills to pay when operating one. not only that, the high end sports cars were once quipped by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear, lest they reach the sea. and these movies are relatively easy to make. hot wheels and hot chicks always go down well together in targeting the required demographic. for once, those plunging necklines exposing uncanny buxom and short skirts accentuating legs two meters long, can\\'t compete with the attention given to those beautiful curves that exotic cars possess in movies such as these. of course there are amongst us (ahem) those that go for the sexists portrayal of women as mere sexual objects (otherwise explain why motor shows come with truckloads of models, and movies such as these cannot do without a leggy model in a frame), however, they don\\'t warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sighs whenever the four wheelers come on screen, even when they do exactly nothing and have their gears into park. the guy sitting beside me, i swear he wet his pants every time his dream car(s) appear, and creamed his pants even more when he hears those growling engine moans. so there we have it, the fan boys who turned up in droves just to watch which of the latest cool cars get featured in the movie. with the fast and the furious franchise, the japanese models like the evos and the skylines take centerstage, as does the gt. here, the ford gt takes on an incredibly drool-worthy facade modification, that even i\\'m impressed, alongside the latest models like the ferrari enzos, porshe carerra gts, koenigsegg ccxs, and every car out there that has wings for doors. but seriously, my heart goes out to the cars each time they\\'re mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment. i mean, this are perfectly fine, high performance models that are at the apex of motoring, but yet because whoever financed the movie had millions to blow, they do so because they can, there\\'s no story in redline, just excuses to put together a movie full of beauties (the cars that is) that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible, and with the usual shots of pedals (always the accelerator, mind you, tapping the brake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy, and earn you no respect), steering wheels, gear shifts (always shifting up and not down), all these while having the actors make pretend that they\\'re the baddest asses with an engine, snarling and giving each other dirty looks. not a very tall order for an actor, and that\\'s why we get the most woeful performances ever, with lines that seem to be written by elementary schoolkids. the heroine (yes, it made a statement that girls can drive) natasha (a very plasticky looking nadia bjorlin) is one of those million dollar finds - a girl with model looks who don\\'t mind getting down on fours and immersed in oil, who has racing pedigree within her, and performs with a rock band singing songs with lyrics that are just plain laughable (every line had to do with cars, and when singing about love, just had to string those innuendos like shifting gear shafts, lubricants and going for rides). introduced against her wishes to illegal racing by a gangsta called infamous (eddie griffin), she gets drawn into family squabbles involving a leo dicaprio lookalike iraq war veteran, and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle. everything else, well like i said, just serves as an excuse for the movie to go from race to race. and it\\'s almost always the same, as there\\'s very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race cars, especially when you know the race is rigged (for narrative reasons) and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line. while fast and furious had quite charismatic actors, and i will put my head on the chopping block by naming paul walker, sun kang, and of course, the star it created - vin diesel, redline had none, just pretty faces with lots of air unfortunately. it looks like a tv movie in its treatment from the get go, with a very insipid opening sequence where it\\'s one man, one car, and a 105 minutes race against time to get to vegas. if not for the cars, then this movie seriously is a piece of junk, with bad acting, bad lines and bad action. strictly for the car fans, or those who like their movies with countless of bevy beauties who pimp their bodies without any speaking lines. im the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when i\\'m picking a film, so i picked five across the eyes, i was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy it,it made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was low budget and very rubbish! i think i could of done better myself. i think that it was the worst film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were rubbish the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch, i think it was a little bit like a cheep rip of off the baler which project and it has not worked at all it was foul. seven ups has been compared to bullitt for the chase scene, but does not come anywhere near matching bullitt. bullitt has a beginning that builds builds builds. when mcqueen leaves the seedy hotel, gets into his mustang, which is parked under the embarcadero freeway (now torn down) and notices the charger sitting nearbye, you know you are about to see something spectacular. from that moment on, when mcqueen starts that car, begins the best car chase sequence ever filmed. adding to it is a terrific lalo schriffin if i remember correctly sound track. this goes on for a long time before you actually hear the first tires squealing. that shot of mcqueen\\'s mustang suddenly appearing in bill hickman\\'s rear view mirror is unmatched for visual impact. hickman\\'s look of surprise and double take really adds to the effect. then of course, san francisco is unmatched for the setting of cars racing up and down hills and around bends. also, bullitt being filmed in the 60s when cars were still \"hot\" (mustang gt and dodge charger) made for a better set of wheels then two boring, smog device laden pontiacs in the 1970s seven ups. bill hickman was the driver of the bad guy car in both movies. i saw him sitting at an insider movie preview once on the univeral lot when i was doing movie reviews for a paper. they gave it a good try in seven ups though with the chase scene. seven ups had a few \"jumps\" over little hills, (yawn) but of course they were not san francisco hills. the seven ups chase, where they are actually going fast, is longer than the go fast sequence in bullitt. but the scene of a single shotgun blast totally blowing the hood off of roy schieders pontiac is the height of absurdity. strictly hollywood, i would say, except that it was filmed in new york. have you ever heard the saying that people \"telegraph their intentions?\" well in this movie, the characters\\' actions do more than telegraph future plans -- they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head. this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better, or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced. embeth davidtz\\'s character is not mysterious, just wooden, and kenneth branagh doesn\\'t succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to have. the bottom line: obvious plot, one-note performances, unlikeable characters, and grotesque \"southern\" accents employed by british actors. \"night of the living homeless\" was a fairly strong finish to the first half of season 11. obviously a parody of various zombie movies, most notably dawn of the dead, this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead, as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brains. kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he, out of the goodness of his heart, gives a $20 to a homeless man in front of his house. more homeless people begin to infiltrate south park, until the town is completely overrun with them. this is a very strong randy marsh episode, as he assumes the role of the shotgun-wielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the park county community center. but before randy makes it to the community center, he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming \"i don\\'t have any change!!\" unfortunately, the refugees end up losing gerald broflofski to the homeless, when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town, and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people. then he becomes one of them, asking everyone for change. the boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in south park, and find a man who is a director of homeless studies. they find out that the nearby city of evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless, so they escape to evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem. unfortunately, homeless people break into the man\\'s house, and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself. however, he fails several times, as he shoots himself in the jaw, in the eye, in the chest, in the neck, in the shoulder, screaming horribly until he finally dies. this scene may have been funnier had a similar scene not happened in \"fantastic easter special\" two weeks ago. meanwhile, a member of the refugees discovers that due to the homeless problem, the property values have nosedived, thus the bank has foreclosed on his house, making him homeless. randy immediately turns on him, holding the gun to the man\\'s head. when the man finally begs the others for a few bucks to help him out, randy pulls the trigger. in evergreen, the boys find out that the citizens of the town sent the homeless to south park, and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country. the boys modify a bus that leads the homeless out of south park and takes them all the way to santa monica, california. the zombie movie parallels and the great randy marsh lines make this one definitely re-watchable. 8/10 i\\'m not sure who decides what category a movie fits into, but this movie is not a horror movie. as for the story, it was fairly interesting, but rather slow. i was especially disappointed with the ending though. **spoiler** tell me why on earth does she run over to her uncle\\'s(?) home without at least calling the detective or the police first? she knows exactly what\\'s going on at that point, plus she has a video tape as proof. instead, she runs over there and starts going nuts and saying \"i know everything, i have proof! you didn\\'t expect proof, did you?!\" then she acts surprised when her uncle stands up and starts walking over to her as if he\\'s going to harm her. well duh! of course he\\'s going to harm you idiot, you just told him you know everything and have proof to expose everything. what a dumb ending. i gave this a 1. there are so many plot twists that you can never be sure to root for. total mayhem. everyone gets killed or nearly so. i am tired of cross hairs and changing views. i cannot give the plot away. convoluted and insane. if i had paid to see this i would demand my money back. i wish reviews were more honest. not an easy film to like at first with both the lead characters quite unlikeable but luckily the heart and soul of the film is paula sage\\'s touching performance which drives the film into uncharted waters and transcends the rather awkward storyline. this gives the film a feeling of real truth and makes you think you\\'ve seen something special.(7/10) i read the book before seeing the movie, and the film is one of the best adaptations out there. very true and faithful to the book. sean penn and sarandon are amazing. robbins is a talented filmaker and i wish he would add more to his repetoire. he made the film very haunting and intentionally slow-paced to add depth. an especially brilliant bit of filmaking was the reflection of the victims appearing in the glass of the execution room at the very end. docteur petiot, starring michel serrault, is a brutal story about a brutal man. a doctor who heals the sick in occupied france, even if their ability to compensate is not there. yet, he preys on the weakest amidst the populace. the imagery and cinematography are superb, and lend an additional macabre feeling to this complex story. he is the perfect psychopath. seductive and altruistic, intelligent and caring, calculating and murderous. a movie certain not to be forgotten soon by the viewer. kudos to mr. serrault, for his chilling portrayal. i just got this video used and i was watching it last night. the acting started out extremely bad (hey------hey------twister) but got very good soon after wards. the tornadoes looked extremely fake, and many of the cgi effects were very dodgy, but the scene with the house cracking apart and the contents inside being blown around and sucked out were extremely well done, and just about on par with movies like twister. the scenes of devastation were also extremely well done too. the story was very well written, and it\\'s refreshing to see a movie like this stray away from the same old \"disaster formulas\" movies of this genre seems to have been stuck in for 30 years. while this movie had a very weird mix of fx and acting quality, this merits an a in my book. this film is really vile. it plays on the urban paranoia of the 70s/80s and puts it into a school context. i\\'m not saying that urban crime wasn\\'t a problem for a lot of people or that schools weren\\'t/aren\\'t problem areas but this vile piece of exploitation takes the biscuit. violence is beyond anything realistically imaginable but in this case it\\'s not a case of social issues but a white, upper-middle class student uses it to turn himself into the crime kingpin of his local high schoiol. and of course he knows how to play the system. does that sound familiar. yes. this turd is pure violent exploitation, a really nasty piece of work. it\\'s disturbing brutality dressed up as a social comment. this belongs in the same category as trash like exterminator, death wish 2-5 and so on and so on. the only remarkable thing is that michael fox was so broke at the time that he had to do stuff like this. what a horrible, horrible film. the worst collection of cliches i have seen in a long time. not that i saw much. i left the theatre screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves. meryl streep was awful as usual. how many hurt and tortured expressions can 1 person have? aidan quinn\\'s talents were - as so often - totally wasted. and who told gloria estefan she could act? trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes. (brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivilegded kids violin in poor neighbourhood school). the kids weren\\'t even cute! just written in to suit the appalling script. aaargh! wes craven really made me cringe for once. real horror this one! motocrossed was fun, but it wasn\\'t that great. i guess i just didn\\'t understand a lot of the motocross racing \"lingo\" (and there was a lot of that in the film)! the plot wasn\\'t what i expected from the disney channel previews, so that could account for some of my disappointment. sixth escapade for freddy krueger in which he has finally managed to kill off virtually every youth in springwood; now he wants to broaden his horizons and (**spoiler**) needs a family member in order to do it. a failure as a horror movie because it simply ain\\'t scary at all. works better as a dark, macabre black comedy, to tell you the truth. freddy krueger has now been stripped of all of his ability to chill this viewer. (too many wisecracks, that\\'s for sure.) the actors aren\\'t interesting (save robert englund, as always, and an obviously slumming yaphet kotto) and there are simply far too many visual effects. the finale is ok but doesn\\'t provide as many sparks as i think one might hope. in adding a new twist to the familiar dream killer\\'s story, it provides englund the opportunity to do more non-makeup scenes than ever before. there are cameos worth noting: a joint cameo by then-couple roseanne and tom arnold that is devoid of entertainment value, an appropriate appearance by veteran shock-rocker alice cooper, and a funny cameo by johnny depp that also sort of acknowledges the pop icon that he had become. film debut of breckin meyer, who plays spencer. one of the best things about it is the replaying of key scenes from earlier entries during the closing credits. 4/10 ok, i\\'m italian but there aren\\'t so many italian film like this. i think that the plot is very good for 3/4 of the film but the final is too simple, too predictable. but it\\'s the only little mistake. the consequences of love in my opinion have great sequences in particular at the beginning and great soundtrack. i\\'d like very much the lighting work on it. the best thing on it is a great, great actor. you know, if your name were al pacino now everybody would have still been talking about this performance. but it\\'s only a great theater italian actor called toni servillo. yes, someone tell me this film and this kind of performance it\\'s too slow, it\\'s so boring, so many silences, but i think that this components its fantastic, its the right way for describing the love story between a very talented young girl, the grand-daughter of the italian actress anna magnani, olivia and the old mysterious man toni. one of my favorite italian films. if you only see one ernest movie in your life, make it this one! this is by far the best in the series, with its nonstop laughs and clever humor that is suitable for all ages. the other \"ernest\" flicks were good too, but most people tend to get tired of him quickly (not me, however.). in this movie, ernest p. whorrel is assigned jury duty for a murder case. the murderer, nash, just happens to look exactly like our bumbling hero ernest. mr. nash finds this a good opportunity to escape from jail by knocking him out switching identities with him, and so we get to see how ernest reacts in the slammer. a great flick! if you haven\\'t already seen it, watch it! an idiotic dentist finds out that his wife has been unfaithful. so, no new story lines here. however, the authors managed to create a stupid, disgusting film. if you enjoy watching kids vomiting, or seeing a dentist imagining that he is pulling all his wife\\'s teeth out in a bloody horror-type, go see (or rent) the film. if not, move on to something else (my fair lady, anyone?) the first cube movie was an art movie. it set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented, and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they couldn\\'t understand. it was, on the non-literal level, a \"man vs. cruel nature\" plot, where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end, triumphing to face a new, indefinable world beyond man\\'s petty squabbles; a world where there were no more struggle, but peace. i rated cube a 10 out of 10, and it\\'s a movie that was never meant to have any sequels. the second movie, hypercube was a massive disappointment. some of the ideas were kind of cool, but in the context of the original movie, both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning. still, for being fairly entertaining, i rated it a 5 out of 10. the third movie, cube zero, while ignoring the second, plays like a vastly inferior commercial b-movie rehash of the first, sans the symbolism. there is no \"homage\" or \"tribute\" here; there is only ripping off. the same kind of plot, with some elements idiotically altered (like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes - an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is a rip-off with absolutely no originality and nothing to say). that we see something from \"behind the scenes\" means nothing, because the watchers are just part of the big bad experiment, the architects of which we hear nothing of. and, in this movie, those who get through to the exit (like kazan did at the end of the first movie) are just killed - where the *bleep* is the sense in that?! that\\'s just flippin\\' stupid. i\\'m glad i didn\\'t pay to see this. the production values and acting in cube zero are not too bad, but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of 3 out of 10. i have just watched this movie on dvd late this morning and was so disappointed that even thought it was a good joke for the audience. in other words - the creators planed to make comedy not drama. howsoever, at the end i realized that mr. tony giglio was earnest about this movie. it\\'s a pity because: the dialogue is ridiculous, the acting is poor and lifeless, the story is a fishy tale! poor ryan phillippe - despite of his efforts his character in the movie remains probably his worst performance! what to say for jason statham - lack of all kinds of skills to develop the role which is an imaginary fiction... for this reasons i vote: 3/10 i believe shakespeare explained what i just read beautifully. me thinks he (the lady) doth protest too much. the whole thing sounded to me as if the author was trying to convince himself! he sites profane literature (writings from the same time period but not connected with the bible) a number of times however i can think of at least three references off the top of my head which lend historical accuracy to events contained in the bible. anyone can skew data & prove anything they like but it doesn\\'t make it true. customs change, word definitions change over time (look at english & german where it is very obviously a common root) nothing stays the same, it\\'s always growing and changing. the bible has many different translations but the king james version is the one i\\'ve found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research. in the king james version you will notice there are certain words written in italics. these words have been added by the translators and can be dropped & the mean of the entire verse changes. writings from around the time of christ were written without spaces, without punctuation, without paragraphs & without numeric verses. these writings look like one long word & the translators added all of the above. for example how would you read this: godisnowhere do you read it as god is nowhere or do you read it as god is now here? same string of letters two entirely different meanings. this is why many biblical researchers use a \\'lexicon\\' to assist them in translation as it provides a word for word translation from the original arabic, greek or hebrew depending on the language in which the scripture was originally written. it\\'s also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic you can prove god exists but you can not prove he doesn\\'t exist! in the end i just love listening to people who think they are so smart that they are qualified to judge the almighty. talk about ego! putting soapbox away, god bless maegi \"i presume you are here for damage to your mental circuitry.\" - val mike nelson made me watch this...he mentioned it in his book, \"movie megacheese.\" i asked myself, \"why would mike nelson steer me wrong?\" i now know why the bots never trusted mike nelson. the music is by john williams, which is probably part of his payment to the devil. in fact, i\\'m sure anyone who worked on this movie is probably in league with ol\\' slewfoot, or is now cursed, from the executive director down to the guy who ran the catering truck outside the studio. don\\'t watch...for the love of god...don\\'t watch!!! not even making a copy and showing someone else will un-curse you...i\\'m doomed now, i understand this. i accept this. but save yourself... this movie was flippin awful....i wanted those hours of my life back. for god\\'s sake, -stay far away from this awful crumb ball movie at all costs. its not worth mentioning the title, but the ratings on this movie are pretty generous for a vomit scum movie like this. and where do i begin? the dumb a** kids in the movie.....the zero plot or story?...the garden-variety college/frat boy-esquire scenes of towel slapping? or the very bad acted, teen angst innuendo? $$$#@%@! my god, it never ended!.....i remember thinking i would have rather kissed the movie theater floor, then sit through this one again. but what do you expect? most people with the brain power to look up reviews, are not going to be the target audience here at all- so go see pirites 2 again, or the jet lee one, -if your debating to yourself. look, this movie will just cost you your soul, your money, your energy, and your brain cells. heed the warning. this is a movie that i can watch over and over and never ever get tired of it, it has lot\\'s of laughs, guns, action, crime,, good one liners, and a decent plot, with an over the top, donald sutherland in a rather comedic role as an assasain. tia carerra looks as hot as she ever did and can act too, thomas ian griffin is great in this as the lead character \"max\" a dea agent diane is the fbi agent, played by carerra, and john lithgow from frazier on tv, plays the bad guy,, \"livingston\". the plot centers around max and diane trying to capture livingston while they fight and argue with each other about who gets the money for the respective agencies, throw into the mix the assassain sutherland, who pretty much has all the good one liners, this is the perfect crime caper, there is the usual love story,, but played very differently than you would think by carerra and griffith. you also have the russian mafia, italian mafia, and chineese mafia here thrown into the mix,, the film is shot in boston,, where you have some great shots , and locals,, great photography and music in this film, this movie is just the epitome of a crime comedy,, it has everything that one could ever want. check out sutherland\\'s toilet in a particular scene,, very unusual. this film is a riot and will make you laugh real hard 10 plus for me. if you like to see animals being skinned alive, their heads smashed, dogs throats being crushed my men stomping on them, then this one is for you! but if you are somewhat normal, and don\\'t need to see real footage of animal cruelty, pass this one up. this movie tries to shock the viewer, and it sure does.with the animal snuff at the beginning, and the killing of babies in the movie (fake at least)its was enough to make myself turn it off.i\\'ve seen movies like this before that show slaughterhouse footage (btk movie) and this kind of footage should not be allowed in a horror movie.we watch gore and horror because we know its just make-up, and special effects, so we shouldn\\'t sit down to watch a movie and see the real killing of animals, its not what we rented the movie for.if anything, there should be a large warning label put on these types of garbage movies so people won;t be surprised by it. as a very hardcore horror fan, this one turned my stomach. the entire movie cast and crew need their heads checked. another spanish movie about the 1936 civil war. this time we\\'re told about the story of carol (lovely played by dã©butant clara lago), a little girl which comes to live to a little spanish village from new york. it is such an initiating trip, and soon she\\'ll find about the injustices of the human race, their stupid fights and conflicts, their contradictions. imanol uribe makes his best film since \"dã\\xadas contados\" (1994) with such a sober pulse, a beautiful photography, and a nice script. he tries not to take part in the conflict, he just shows us some facts and let us decide (ok, the facts are explicit enough to make us decide in which band are we in) and he takes a huge advantage of the presence and the freshness of the young starring couple: clara lago and juan josã© ballesta. a well cared production. my rate: 7/10 a response to previous comments made by residents of the region where this motion picture was lensed: one person suggested that the closing and destruction of the ocean view amusement park led to a downturn in the surrounding neighborhoods. this is simply not true. prior to the construction of interstate 64, which bypasses the ocean view area, the primary route for traffic went through the heart of ocean view. once the interstate was completed, ocean view rapidly became a ghost town with businesses closing up and an increase in crime. this led to a huge reduction in revenues for the park, which also faced new competition from nearby busch gardens in williamsburg. meanwhile, in the past few years, the city of norfolk has done a remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area has become a sought-after location for construction of high-end housing. it has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film \"rollercoaster\". this is also untrue. footage was shot of two coaster cars careening off the ride for that film, but the actual explosions and collapse are exclusive to \"death of ocean view park\". as to the film itself, the storyline of a \"supernatural\" force in the water adjacent to the park was certainly silly, but somewhat typical for b-grade movies of the time. with the cast involved, there should be no surprise that the scenery was gnawed in almost every scene by the primary actors. i don\\'t believe this film was intended to be another \"citizen kane\"; i believe playboy was experimenting with a new non-nude format to determine if this was an area for the company to expand into (apparently not!). a strange force in the water causing strange events in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the conference table, but proved unmanageable in execution. the roller coaster and the rest of the park was destined for the wrecking ball anyway; \"let\\'s come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise!\". for the casual movie viewer, this would be a \"see once and forget about it\" film (except for diana canova fans); but for the thousands of people who live in the region and have fond memories of the park, this movie is like a \"walk down memory lane\" for footage of the park as well as old footage of downtown norfolk, the first \"harborfest\", and old dominion university. even a limited release of this film on dvd would be welcome. i was expecting a lot from mr.amitabh bachan\\'s role of sarkar, but am disappointed. being a ram gopal verma\\'s direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie. sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the movie shows that amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his. there is a movie in tamil called nayakan based on the theme of god father and kamala hassan has played the lead. the movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of kamala hassan, not his son. amitabh bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things. the movie fails to show the strong impact of god father. a trio of buddies, sergeants all in the british army, carouse & brawl their way across imperial india. intensely loyal to each other, they meet their greatest & most deadly challenge when they encounter the resurgence of a hideous cult & its demented, implacable guru. now they must rely on the lowliest servant of the regiment, the water carrier gunga din, to save scores of the queen\\'s soldiers from certain massacre. based more on the three musketeers than kipling\\'s classic poem, this is a wonderful adventure epic - a worthy entry in hollywood\\'s golden year of 1939. filled with suspense & humor, while keeping the romantic interludes to the barest minimum, it grips the interest of the viewer and holds it right up to the (sentimental) conclusion. it is practically fruitless to discuss the performance nuances of the three stars, cary grant, victor mclaglen & douglas fairbanks jr., as they are really all thirds of a single organism - inseparable and, to all intents & purposes, indistinguishable. however, this diminishes nothing of the great fun in simply watching them have a glorious time. (it\\'s interesting to note, parenthetically, that mclaglen boasted of a distinguished world war one military career; fairbanks would have a sterling record in world war two - mostly in clandestine affairs & earning himself no fewer than 4 honorary knighthoods after the conflict; while grant reportedly worked undercover for british intelligence, keeping an eye on hollywood nazi sympathizers.) the real acting laurels here should go to sam jaffe, heartbreaking in the title role. he infuses the humble man with radiant dignity & enormous courage, making the last line of kipling\\'s poem ring true. he is unforgettable. montague love is properly stalwart as the regimental major, whilst eduardo ciannelli is evil incarnate as the thuggee guru. the rest of the cast, joan fontaine, robert coote, lumsden hare, are effective but have little to do. movie mavens will recognize cecil kellaway in the tiny role of miss fontaine\\'s father. the film picks its villains well. the demonic thuggee cult, worshipers of the hideous, blood-soaked kali, hindu goddess of destruction, was the bane of indian life for 6 centuries, ritualistically strangling up to 30,000 victims a year. in 1840 the british military, in cooperation with a number of princely states, succeeded in ultimately suppressing the religion. henceforth it would remain the stuff of novels & nightmares. this movie pretty much sucked. i\\'m in the army and the soldiers depicted in this movie are horrible. if your in the military and you see this movie you\\'ll laugh and be upset the entire movie because of the way they acted as a squad. it was ridiculous. they acted like a bunch of normal people with army uniforms on not knowing what to do. it was a pretty gory movie i\\'d have to say the least. there was a couple scenes where they try to make you jump. i\\'d recommend seeing it if you are bored and want to see a violent, gory movie. it will be a better movie also if your not in the military. i also would have to say i liked the first one better than this one. if you watched pulp fiction don\\'t see this movie. this movie is not funny. this is the worst parody movie ever. this is a poor attempt of parody films. the cast is bad. the film is bad. this is one of the worst pictures ever made. i do not recommend plump fiction. i prefer the original pulp fiction by the great quentin tarantino. this is one of the worst parody films ever made. plump fiction is not a good movie. it is not funny. it is so dumb and vulgar. i went to see \"passion of mind\" because i usually get a kick out of the genre of alternate reality romances, i.e. \"sliding doors,\" \"me, myself, i,\" etc. but this was the worst one i\\'ve ever seen! i had to force myself to sit through it. i didn\\'t even stay through the credits which is unheard of for me. the magical realism was completely missing because demi moore was grim and the lovers she was two-timing were guys who usually play villains, though each was kind of sexy and appealing. there was actually a psychological explanation provided for the dual lives, with a distasteful frisson of the elektra complex; maybe the magic shouldn\\'t be explained for this genre to work. (originally written 5/28/2000) i thought that rotj was clearly the best out of the three star wars movies. i find it surprising that rotj is considered the weakest installment in the trilogy by many who have voted. to me it seemed like rotj was the best because it had the most profound plot, the most suspense, surprises, most emotional,(especially the ending) and definitely the most episodic movie. i personally like the empire strikes back a lot also but i think it is slightly less good than than rotj since it was slower-moving, was not as episodic, and i just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as i did with the third movie. it also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole. i have heard many strange reasons such as: a) because yoda died b) because bobba fett died c) because small ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d) because darth vader was revealed i would like to debunk each of these reasons because i believe that they miss the point completely. first off, who cares if bobba fett died??? if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die. don\\'t get me wrong i am fan of bobba fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not lucas\\' intention to make him a central character in the films that star wars fans made him out to be. his name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie... you had to go to the credits to find out bobba fett\\'s name!!! judging rotj because a minor character died is a bit much i think... secondly, many fans did not like yoda dying. sure, it was a momentous period in the movie. i was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic. all the good guys can\\'t stay alive in a realistic movie, you know. otherwise if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon. another aspect to this point about people not liking yoda\\'s death.. well, nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in a new hope. (many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy) why was obi wan\\'s death okay but yoda\\'s not... hmmmmmmmmmmmm.... another reason i just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible. that is utterly ridiculous!! i can not believe this one!! first off, the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there. if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage. (since you lived in the forest all your life i hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage) they had swinging vines, ropes, logs set up to trip those walkers, and other traps. the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest. the only thing they had was their blasters. to add, it was not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves, they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest. i thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the star wars heros, the band of rebels, as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain, that would have been a great upset. lastly, if this scene was still unbelievable to you.. how about in empire strikes back or in a new hope where there were several scenes of a group consisting of just han solo, chewbacca, and the princess, being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view!! and not only that, the heroes , of course, always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters. the troopers must have very, very bad aim then! at least in empire strikes back, the battle of endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers. don\\'t believe me? check out the battle at cloud city when our heroes were escaping lando\\'s base. or when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot at (somehow they missed)as han solo and luke were trying to exit the death star. the last reason that i care to discuss (others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here.) is that people did not like darth vader being revealed! well, in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie. luke was trying to find whether or not darth vader was his father, annakin skywalker. it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his father\\'s face because it made it complete. by annakin\\'s revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side (in his helmet) and to the good person he was annakin skywalker (by removing the helmet). the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about. in fact, that\\'s is what i would have done in that scene too if i were luke\\'s father...isn\\'t that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet? on another note, i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse (even if it is better) that preceding movies is another reason that rotj does not get as many accolades as it deserves. i never go into a film with that deception in mind, i always try to go into a film with the attitude that \"well, it might be better or worse that the original .. but i can not know for sure.. let\\'s see.\" that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was. i am not sure who criticizes these movies but, i have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite star wars movie and they all tell me (except for one person that said that a new hope was their favorite) that it is rotj. i believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading. bottom line, the return of the jedi was the best of the trilogy. this movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes. there was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful, exciting, surprising, or all of the above. for example, the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj was better than the one in the empire strikes back any day!!! finally, i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky, insignificant details (or see it as \"just another sequel\") to trash the movie such as \"this movie stinks because luke is not in it!\" then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffered unfortunately. crossfire remains one of the best hollywood message movies because, unlike the admirably intentioned gentleman\\'s agreement, which it beat to theatres by a few months, it chooses to send its message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than have an outraged star constantly saying \"it\\'s because i\\'m jewish, isn\\'t it?\" it\\'s much easier to get the message that hate is like a loaded gun across when the dead bodies are actual rather than metaphorical. somewhat shamefully, the brief featurette on the warners\\' dvd doesn\\'t mention that novelist richard brooks disowned the film over the shift from a homophobic murder to an anti-semitic one, but it\\'s interesting to note that while the victim is killed primarily because he is jewish, there\\'s little doubt in sam levene\\'s performance that the character is in fact also gay â– not a mincing caricature, but there\\'s definitely a two lost souls aspect to his scenes with george cooper\\'s confused soldier. there\\'s not much of a mystery to who the murderer is: even though the killing is carried out in classic noir shadows, the body language of the killer is instantly recognisable, but then the film has its characters drift to the same conclusion before the halfway point: the tension comes from proving it and saving the fall guy. there\\'s an element of ealing films to the gang of soldiers teaming together to get their buddy out of a fix (you could almost see that aspect as a blueprint for hue and cry), but the atmosphere is pure rko noir. set over one long sweltering night, the film has a great look filled with deep dark blacks and shadows born as much out of economy as style (it cut back on lighting time and allowed director edward dmytryk more time to work with the actors) and the excellent cast make the most of the fine script: a laid-back but quietly charismatic robert mitchum, robert young\\'s maigret-like detective, gloria grahame\\'s tramp and the perpetually creepy paul kelly as her compulsive liar admirer, a guy who tries on stories the way other people try on ties. but the lasting impression is of robert ryan\\'s excellent performance as a guy who could do with a good leaving alone as he does his best to help the wrongly accused man all the way to death row. a big surprise hit in 1946, as a reward, dmytryk and producer adrian scott found themselves investigated by the huac, which itself had a notable tendency to target jews. so much for crusadingâ… this movie basically is a very well made production and gives a good impression of a war situation and its effects on those involved. it\\'s always interesting to see the story from the \\'other\\' side for a change. this movie concentrates on a group of german soldiers who after fighting in the north africa campaign are send to stalingrad, russia, where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battles of ww ii is being fought. it\\'s interesting to see the other side of this battle, since we mainly just always see the germans simply as the \\'villains\\'. in this movie those \\'villains\\' are given an humane face and voice and it sort of makes you realize that the only true enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily those who you\\'re fighting against. at first it\\'s kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the german\\'s are the evil villains. but of course you get accustomed to it quickly and you soon adapt the germans as the main characters of the movie and you even start to care -and be interested in them. the way this story is told isn\\'t however the best. it\\'s hard to keep track of the story at times, as it jumps from the one sequence and location to the other. the movie isn\\'t always logic in its storytelling and features a bit too many sequences that remain too vague. it also is most of the time pretty hard to keep the characters apart and see who is who. it doesn\\'t always makes this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand, there are plenty enough sequences and moments present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one, just not the most coherent one around. in that regard hollywood movies are always better than european movies. the production values are high and features some good looking sets and locations, though the movie wasn\\'t even shot in russia itself. it helps to create a good war time situation atmosphere. the character are mostly interesting although perhaps a tad bit formulaic. but i don\\'t know, for some reason formulaic characters always work out fine in war movies and strenghtens the drama and realism. it also helps that they\\'re being played by well cast actors. all of the actors aren\\'t the best known actors around (thomas kretschmann was also at the time still a fairly unknown actor) but each of them fit their role well and gives its characters an unique face and personality. all in all not the best or most consistent ww ii drama around but definitely worth a look, due to its original approach of the german side of the battle of stalingrad and its good production values. 7/10 so i rented this from netflix because somebody gave me roger ebert\\'s book \"i hated, hated, hated this movie\" and he gave this one a rare zero-star rating in the book and said at the end of his original review \"mad dog time should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor\". so i figured from ebert saying that i would see if it was really as bad as he said it was. i know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but i could not express how much i hated this piece of junk like ebert did and never since ebert\\'s review of rob reiner\\'s \"north\" where he said he hated that movie ten times had i ever heard such a brilliant hatred movie review. here we have richard dreyfuss as a gangster which i don\\'t think it would be terrible to see dreyfuss as a gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well. but above all the other things that were awful about this \"movie\" i can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all. while the movie starts off with jeff goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching dreyfuss\\'s girlfriend while dreyfuss was at a criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits. but after that first 4 or 5 minutes the other 85 minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for 30 seconds then someone gets shot. then there are a whole bunch of jokes about dreyfuss being mentally ill. haha. not funny. then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying frank sinatra\\'s \"my way\" sang by gabriel byrne apparently to insult dreyfuss. of course because the screenplay was written on the level of a sixth grader dreyfuss shoots byrne over five times and byrne just will not die. are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny? i can certainly tell you i did not care or find that funny. not only am i disappointed in dreyfuss (who i admire much as an actor) for producing and starring in this tripe but i am also extremely disappointed in jeff goldblum because this was released the same year that \"independence day\" was the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history. did goldblum feel that \"independence day\" would be a flop and then just take the next role that was offered to him to make some money if \"independence day\" were a bomb? what did an oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making films in history find remotely enjoyable about this? the opening sequence of \"mad dog time\" says that the movie is set on another planet. i only wish now that i have wasted 93 minutes watching this trash that it would have stayed and opened in theaters on the planet where it supposedly takes place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of 93 minutes out of my life that i will never get back. ebert saying the movie should have been cut up is not good enough i am afraid. every copy of \"mad dog time\" should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire. i have yet to top a worst movie i have ever seen because this one has won it\\'s honor as the worst movie ever. what a boring film! to sum it all up, its was basically just nana patekar beating up his daughter-in-law karisma kapoor, while she tried to flee from the village, with her son. can someone say boring??? the concept wasn\\'t too bad, but it was poorly executed. the canadian locales, and some of the village scenes were nicely shot. however, overall the cinematography came up short. the story could have been great, but the movie just seemed to drag on. there is only so much stupidity a person can take, let alone three bloody hours of it. the best part of the whole movie was the song \"ishq kamina\", and that was only five minutes long. other than that, this movie was a piece of crap. {rant start} i didn\\'t want to believe them at first, but i guess this is what people are talking about when they say south korean cinema has peaked and may even be going downhill. after the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie \"gwoemul\" (aka \"the host\") of 2006-- which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire out of a b-movie genre-- successive korean blockbusters have become more and more generic, even though their budgets (mainly spent on special effects) have become more and more fantastic. do south korean movie-makers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill, which their industry has built up since the 1999 break-out film \"shiri/swiri\", by making a whole series of big budget mediocre movies like mainland china did? {rant end} the only \"reason\" i can fathom for making this movie is to dupe the investors into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a korean/ east asian-styled dragon i have seen to date, for the final scenes. now if they had introduced that dragon at the beginning and given it more personality and purpose like in the 1996 \"dragonheart\", the movie might have had a few more redeeming qualities other than having lots of digitally animated dragons. remember \"dungeons & dragons\" in 2000? hasn\\'t anyone learnt that the trick is not how much special effects you use, but how well you use it? i hope there are more (and better) korean legends they can use, because they have just killed a lot of international interest in korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this one. in short, i agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how koreans felt about having their folk anthem \"arirang\" being played at the very end. as a creature feature, i would have given it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences had been worth it, but i\\'ve seen many video games with better camera work and scripting (just less dragons). as a native chinese, i can not accept this kind of idea that some people must die for a \\'better world\\'. i said \\'better world\\' because it is a lie that chinese people have been indoctrinated for thousand years! i guess most western audience may don\\'t know qin shihuang(means the first emperor), the king in this film is the most notorious tyrant in ancient china. the tianxia(chinese word was spoken by the king, means \\'the land and the people\\') spoken from his mouth is totally lie. from then on, one after another, all the king in ancient china spoke the same thing but very few of them did as what they said. another fact is, qin shihuang\\'s empire only lasted about twenty years before it was destroyed by people. well, i do like the beautiful scenes of this movie, but it can not make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant. this had a great cast with big-name stars like tyrone power, henry fonda, randolph scott, nancy kelly, henry hull and brian donlevey and a bunch more lesser-but-known names with shorter roles. it also had technicolor, one of the few movies made with it in 1939. now the bad news.......regrettably, i can\\'t say much positive for the story. it portrayed the james boys in a totally positive light....and hollywood has done that ever since. why these criminals are always shown to be the \"good guys\" is beyond me. this film glamorizes them and made their enemies - the railroad people - into vicious human beings. the latter was exaggerated so much it was preposterous. well, that\\'s the film world for you: evil is good; good is bad. hey hollywood: here\\'s a news flash - the james boys were criminals! really - look it up! i remember watching this series avidly, every saturday evening. it was the highlight of the week. i loved everything about it, the location, the costumes, the actors and the wonderful music by clannad (i still have their legend album). i loved the way they solved the problem of michael praed leaving by creating another robin, this time the earl of huntingdon. i believe there were legends of several robins in medieval times. another thing i loved was the fact that it was filled with young actors, i\\'m sure robin and his men would have young, after all people didn\\'t live that long in those days. other robins always look too old (kevin costner with his ridiculous accent looked like robin\\'s granddad). the only sad thing was the ending, it\\'s a shame they couldn\\'t at least have done a one off special to tie up all the loose ends and give it a happier ending. i don\\'t normally write reviews, but this \"film\" was special. i couldn\\'t turn it off. i don\\'t believe i\\'ve ever seen a worse movie, but there i sat, watching. it was like a horrible car wreck with blood flowing all over the highway. it was disgusting, but i couldn\\'t turn away. where do i start? the movie seems to think it\\'s a sports thriller, but it\\'s so utterly ridiculous, it can only be a comedy, but it\\'s not funny, not even in a dumb/silly way. it\\'s like watching your cousins try to act out a skit on family get-togethers. it\\'s painful to watch, but at least it\\'s only for a minute or two. second string went on for over an hour. whoever was involved with making this movie should not work again. the writing, directing, acting, and everything was just terrible. the problem is i can\\'t describe how bad it was; you just had to see it. and i\\'m sure this will never be shown again, so unless you saw it, you\\'re out of luck. i mean it was almost worth seeing just for the fact that it gave me some appreciation for every other \"bad\" film i\\'ve seen over my lifetime. and for every film i see in the future that i can\\'t stand, i will think to myself, well, at least it wasn\\'t bad as the second string. few would argue that master animation director hayao miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability. (no. too many are focused on john lassiter\\'s \"amazing\" ability to steal other movies plots, turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be lauded as a genius . . . but i digress.) miyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues (usually ecologically themed), and has an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that was animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance. still, miyazaki (almost) never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies- children. that said, i am at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability. where else are you going to have a film where a three year old (my nephew link) will sit still throughout the move, enthralled, a 7 year old (my niece amber) loving it all her own (and able to appreciate the \"star power\" of frankie jonas and noah cyrus, a 12 year old (my nephew aaron) who\\'s review was \"of course it was good! everything miyazaki-san does is good!,\" a 32 year old animation fan brought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation (er, that would be me), and a 58 year old woman (my mother) able to connect with the mother characters (and i\\'m betting the older charas too) and loving the \"cuteness\" of the child characters. and that is what i respect most about miyazaki-san. he seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker. on the surface, \"ponyo\" could be seen as a simple story about a little fish-girl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there, a little boy names soske (somewhat like \"the little mermaid\"), but there is an entire different level at play here. true to form, miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female characters ponyo\\'s mother, soske\\'s mother, the older ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willed. but the girl who takes the cake is ponyo herself. once she decides that she likes the human world, she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams. her father is trying to keep her innocent, and keep her a magical fish, but young ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination. once human, she teams up with her friend, soske, whom she loves very much (although maybe not as much as ham). soske is asked to be the man of the house (at age five) when his mother lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during a typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by ponyo on her quest to become human. frankie jonas (yes. he\\'s related to the jonas brothers. can we just get past that please?) gives, perhaps, the best performance in the film as young soske (which is good since he has the most lines). his character is also strong willed, but also very respectful and friendly- characteristics you\\'re not likely to find in a child character on this side of the pacific. in the end, ponyo\\'s father, fujimoto must cope with his daughter\\'s decision and his estranges wife\\'s wishes to allow her to be human. he hopes that ponyo and soske will \"remember him fondly.\" and once again, miyazaki refuses to allow a character to become the stereotypical \"bad guy.\" although miyazaki has (for some reason) received some criticism for this, it is, honestly, what makes his movies magical and yet relatable. no one in real life is completely a \"bad person.\" all humans are various shades of gray. and that is exactly what miyazaki does with his characters. and then there\\'s the animation itself. in a time when cgi would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film, especially the water, miyazaki has chosen to incorporate no cgi whatsoever. certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means, but every film in this was hand-drawn and i, for one, was extremely grateful for that. the character animation was extremely fluid, and there even appeared to be some lip-sync going on (quite unusual for an anime film). the backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience. this is what animation used to look like- and what it should look like. in the end, i found ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable. certainly not miyazaki\\'s best (in my opinion, that honor is still held by kiki\\'s delivery service), but still a 10-star fun movie for the entire family. attractive marjorie(farrah fawcett)lives in fear after being accosted by a lone biker. she is mortally shaken with the fact her attacker knows her address. as expected, joe(james russo), the attacker forces his way into marjorie\\'s home and subjects her to humiliating terror. bruised and bloody, marjorie manages to get an upper hand on her attacker, knocking the living daylights out of the jerk and renders him helpless thanks to wasp spray in his eyes and throat. hog tied and battered himself, joe tries to explain himself to marjorie\\'s roommates(diana scarwid and alfrie woodard) when they get home. there is almost a hint of mercy, but it is not coming from marjorie. should she continue to render her own punishment? violence, sexual abuse and rough language makes for an r rating. fawcett really gets away from the ditsy roles that would forever stain her career. kudos to director robert m. young. i find it sad that just because edward norton did not want to be in the film or have anything to do with it, people automatically think the movie sucks without even watching it or giving it a chance. i really hope norton did not do this. he is a fine actor and all but he scared people away from a decent movie. i found it entertaining. it wasn\\'t mind blowing or anything with crazy special effects, but it was not a bad. it was fun to watch. but yea, definitely not a bad/horrible movie. 7/10 i watched this movie on tv last night, hoping for a realistic account of what could happen if there were an outbreak of some highly transmittable disease. i was disappointed, and i think the movie was garbage. it did not seem real to me. some of the acting was awful, in particular that of the doctor. she was about the worst i\\'ve seen. the whole thing played like a cnn \\'worst case scenario\\'. even the obligatory disaster movie human relations bits didn\\'t seem sincere. i have seen some disaster movies, in particular those weather ones, which are actually so bad they are amusing. this one is almost as bad, but it is not even amusing, it is tedious and boring.don\\'t bother with this one. for those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings, who love film, have good attention to detail and enjoy indie movies with funny, smartly written dialogue then this is a film for you. for those with a poor attention span, high expectations and no brains.. well.. um.. you may get bored and find things dragging at times. this is a charming, modest and well paced movie with the actors bestowing a real sense of depth and warmth to their roles. i chuckled to myself pretty much the whole way through.. this film is a little gem. the great caruso was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all box office records at radio city music hall in a year when most \"movergoers\" were stay-at-homes watching their new 7\" motorola televisions. almost all recent box office figures are false --- because they fail to adjust inflation. obviously today\\'s $10 movies will dominate. in 1951 it cost 90c to $1.60 at radio city; 44c to 75c first run at loew\\'s palace in washington dc, or 35c to 50c in neighborhood runs. what counts is the number of people responding to the picture, not unadjusted box office \"media spin.\" the genius of the great caruso was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of enrico caruso (really not a great story anyway) and threw it in the trash. instead, 90% of the movie\\'s focus was on the music. thus mgm gave us the best living opera singer mario lanza doing the music of the best-ever historic opera singer enrico caruso. the result was a wonderful movie. too bad lanza would throw his life and career away on overeating. too fat to play the student prince, edmund purdom took his place --- with lanza\\'s voice dubbed in, and with the formerly handsome and not-fat lanza pictured in the advertising. if you want to see the great caruso, it\\'s almost always on ebay for $2.00 or less. don\\'t be put off by the low price, as it reflects only the easy availability of copies, not the quality of the movie. i attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from kevin costner and ashton kutcher; both have delivered less than memorable performances & films. while the underlying \"general\" storyline is somewhat familiar, this film was excellent. both costner and kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other. the human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both; the scene when costner confronts kutcher with the personal reasons why kutcher joined the coast guard rescue elite was the film\\'s most unforgettable emotional moment. the \"specific\" storyline was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite coast guard rescuers must go through in preparation of their only job & responsibility...to save lives at sea. the special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and \"wowing\"...i haven\\'t seen such angry seas since \"the perfect storm\". co-star clancy brown (hbo\\'s \"carnivale\" - great to see him again) played the captain of the coast guard\\'s kodiak, alaska base in a strong, convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins. the film wonderfully, and finally, gives long overdue exposure and respect to the coast guard; it had the audience applauding at the end. 1) i am not weapon expert, but even i can see difference between u.s. army riffles in wwi and wwii. in movie we can see privates, armed with \"m1 garand\" (invented in year 1932!), not authentic \"1903 springfield\" (aka \"silent death\"), who privates use until wwii. difference - m1 can load 1,5 times more ammunition and 3 times more fire rate! m1 was semi - automatic, springfield requires reloading after every shot. little difference?! 2) german army uniforms has borrowed from 1940 year too. especially - helmets. german helmets until end of wwi have significant pike on top, we cannot see even one in movie. and if we make little additional search in archives - how much truthful is this \"true story\"? i am surprised, how much \"truthful\" can be film directors in a pursuit of cheap propagation. do you ever wonder what is the worst movie ever made? stop wondering. i\\'m telling you, michael is it! it is not \"heartwarming,\" \"entertaining,\" or \"travolta at his best.\" it just sucks. if i had kids, i would let them watch deep throat before michael! a sold-out john travolta, a washed-up and balding william hurt, and an about to die any time now jean stapleton highlight this turd of a film. but wait...you\\'ll get to hear andie mcdowell sing! yeah. hollywood really s**t all over us with this one! the film began with wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend. her aunt (edna may oliver--a person too talented for this film) didn\\'t like wheeler--a sentiment i can easily relate to. the aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from wheeler. they left and wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king. at about the same time, woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king. so when wheeler arrived, it was up to the boys to fight it out, but they refused because they are already friends--which greatly disappointed the people, as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime. i am a huge fan of comedy from the golden age of hollywood--the silent era through the 1940s. i have seen and reviewed hundreds, if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films i have never been able to understand the appeal of wheeler and woolsey--the only comedy team that might be as bad as the ritz brothers! despite being very successful in their short careers in hollywood (cut short due to the early death of robert woolsey), i can\\'t help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better. for example, there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the marx brother\\'s film, duck soup, yet cracked nuts never made me laugh and duck soup was a silly and highly enjoyable romp. at times, woolsey talked a bit like groucho, but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny! in fact, he just seemed to prattle pointlessly. his only funny quality was that he looked goofy--surely not enough reason to put him on film. additionally, wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese--a piece of cheese that sang very poorly! a missed opportunity was the old vaudeville routine later popularized by abbott and costello as \"who\\'s on first\" which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing. in fact, soon after they started their spiel, they just ended the routine--so prematurely that you are left frustrated. i knew that \"who\\'s on first\" had been around for many years and used by many teams, but i really wanted to see wheeler and woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist. once again, i have found yet another sub-par film by this duo. while i must admit that i liked a few of their films mildly (such as silly billies and the rainmakers--which i actually gave 6\\'s to on imdb), this one was a major endurance test to complete--something that i find happens all too often when i view the films of wheeler and woolsey. where was all the humor?! i was really hoping that this would be a funny show, given all the hype and the clever preview clips. and talk about hype, i even heard an interview with the show\\'s creator on the bbc world today - a show that is broadcast all over the world. unfortunately, this show doesn\\'t even come close to delivering. all of the jokes are obvious - the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame - and they are not given any new treatment or twist. all of the characters are one-dimensional. the acting is - well - mediocre (i\\'m being nice). it\\'s the classic cbc recipe - one that always fails. if you\\'re muslim i think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters, and if you\\'re white you\\'d probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted, ignorant, or both. not that making fun of white people is a problem - most of the better comedies are rooted in that. it\\'s only a problem when it isn\\'t funny - as in this show. canada is bursting with funny people - so many that we export them to hollywood on a regular basis. so how come the producers of this show couldn\\'t find any? first of all \"mexican werewolf in texas\" is not a werewolf movie. this title is bullcrap. the story is actually about a chupacabra that kills all the local villagers in the little town of furlough in texas. i suppose the distributors renamed the original title so that it would make some extra bucks or something. and i guess it actually works because that\\'s the reason why i bought this piece of crap, it sounded so stupid. anyway the movie isn\\'t any good. actually it\\'s bloody awful. but i didn\\'t expect anything else when i bought it. it\\'s a low budget horror movie with a chupacabra monster. if you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog, actors and some gore then you should check into this movie. but i must warn you, this movie is really baaaaaaad. this movie has some of the worst acting i have ever seen. the actors try to hard and t it gets completely ridiculous. they almost never say a line in a normal way. they always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say. it\\'s so stupid it almost looks like a freakin parody. it\\'s like they shot each scene only one single time and were happy about it. the worst of them all is the blond girl which is supposed to play a bimbo. she\\'s the worst of them all. i have never seen an actor as bad as her (and i\\'ve seen pteradactyl). even when her boyfriend dies she can\\'t stop being a bimbo about it. i hate her. some of the shots in this movie were actually quite good. the ones that where shot in the daytime are all pretty decent for a low budget project. but most of the movie is shot in the night when the chupacabra strikes and the lighting is way too dark. the gore scenes are few and short, but really grizzly and violent. the effects are pretty hilarious really, but that\\'s the way i like it. the chupacabra looks pretty messed up, and it\\'s easy to see that it\\'s a guy in suit. overall this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget flicks and it\\'s very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bored to death. i recommend watching this flick with your friends and some beer. this movie is so god-awful that it was literally a chore to watch. i wanted to eject it from my vcr and throw it across the room, but kept thinking (foolishly) that it would eventually get funny and then everything would be all right. \"you lose, we win, yay!\" this movie should be required viewing for anyone who even once entertained the thought that jackie mason was funny. after that, beat them ove the head with this movie until the tape cracks. and if you\\'re even considering renting this turd (or worse yet, have!) i have one thing to ask of you: didn\\'t you even look at the cover? i mean, with crap like this you can tell with just a glance how bad it is! \"oy vey!\" this movie sucked. the symbolic use of objects, form editing, the position of characters in the scene... these were all used with such joyous abandon by hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had. the way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses, the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger... while these may seem a bit obvious by todays standards, in the silent era they spoke volumes about the story without a word being spoken. even the title has a least four meanings that i can see; the boxing ring, the wedding ring, the bracelet the lover buys, and the love triangle at the heart of the story. i found this movie to be very good in all areas. the acting was brilliant from all characters, especially ms.stone and morissey. tramell\\'s character just gets smarter and more psychologically twisted by the minute. the plot is interesting even though, this movie is more for the mind playing between the main characters and how catherine continues her writing with new ways and twists for her novels. the setting was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysterious,thriller like masterpiece. go see this film now , it deserves better than what it got from the audience ,which was misled by some faulty terrible reviews about the movie(before it even started).....you won\\'t regret it,if you go see it... rather like paul newman and steve mcqueen with their racing car movies this has all the appearance of a \"jollies\" project for robert redford, as he gets to ski up hill and down dale in the alpine sunshine. the story is as light as powdered snow with redford\\'s small-town boy david chappellet (what kind of lead name is that?) who with his eyes on the prize of olympic glory, gets up the nose of, in no particular order, his coach, father and team-mates. women are a mere side-show in his insular world as evidenced by a fairly distasteful pick-up scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of, heavens above, a free-thinking, independent woman, played by camilla sparv. the ski-ing sequences are fine with some good stunt-work involving numerous bumps and scrapes on the piste but their effectiveness is dimmed by our subsequent familiarity with top tv coverage of skiing events down to the present day. plus i\\'m not convinced that the winter olympics has the same mass identification with the general public as the summer games so that when redford eventually wins his gold medal in the final reel, i couldn\\'t really be that excited for him one way or another. of the actors, redford, best profile forward, doesn\\'t need to do much and indeed doesn\\'t, while gene hackman does better with equally meagre material. ms sparv does well as the chief female interest well who treats redford the way he\\'s doubtless treated every other woman in his chauvinistic way. in truth though, there\\'s a lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequences don\\'t fully compensate and you don\\'t care a fig for any of the leading characters. one of those films where the actors probably enjoyed making it more than the viewers did watching it. i would recommend this film to anyone who is searching for a relaxing, fun-filled, thought-provoking movie. the absence of sex, vulgarities and violence made for a most pleasant evening. i especially enjoyed the buffalo scene, but that\\'s probably because i live a short distance from there. even so, this film could have been produced in any city; it\\'s the theme that\\'s so important here. i\\'m just grateful that manna from heaven dropped down on us. try it...you\\'ll like it! this is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 (the national film preservation foundation says 1969 and imdb says 1972). regardless of the exact date, the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period--with some camera-work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s-early 70s. the film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks. these distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort. this was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art, and like most performance art, it\\'s interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome. the film, to put it even more bluntly, is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film, their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and \"with it\" to be understood by us mortals. i read the book and saw the movie. both excellent. the movie is diamond among coals during this era. liebman and selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without flaw. this film should have made them stars. shame on the studio for not putting everything they had behind this film. it could have easily been a franchise. release on dvd is a must and a worthy remake would revive this film. look for it in your tv guide and if you see it listed, no matter how late, watch it. you won\\'t be disappointed. do yourself another favor - read the book (same title). it\\'ll blow you away. times have changed dramatically since those days, or at least we like to think they have. a drifter looking for a job is mistaken for a hit man in a small wyoming town, leading to all kinds of complications. cage is perfectly cast as the unlucky schmuck hoping to make a quick buck and get out of town but finding he can\\'t escape the title town. hopper does what he does best, playing a psycho known as \"lyle from dallas,\" the real hit man. walsh as a crooked sheriff and boyle as a femme fatale round out the fine cast. the script by brothers john and rick dahl contains delicious twists and turns, and john\\'s direction creates a terrific \"neo noir\" atmosphere. witty and very entertaining, it sucks the viewer in from the start and never lets up. i really liked this movie. i have seen several gene kelly flicks and this is one of his best. i would actually put it above his more famous american in paris. sometimes it seems the story gets lost in gene kelly movies to the wonderful dance and song numbers, but not in this movie. it is definitely worth renting. although promoted as one of the most sincere turkish films with an amateur cast, ice-cream, i scream is more like a caricature of sincerity. the plot opens with the dream of ali, a traveling ice-cream salesman in a western anatolia town, in which he sees himself becoming successful using the same marketing methods of big ice-cream companies. he dreams of playing in his product\\'s tv commercial with beautiful models in bikinis, dancing around him. as his dream turns into a nightmare, he wakes up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife, who rejects to make sex with him for 6 years with no apparent reason. is it because he is not successful in his job? apparently, because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from global ice-cream companies. but this is what he says; we actually don\\'t see him suffer that much: he still sells good, traveling the neighboring villages while his apprentice stays at the shop, selling ice-cream to the people in the town. ali blames big companies for using sweetening and coloring agents while he is using real \"sahlep\" (powdered roots of mountain orchids). ali buys a motorbike with a bank loan to be a traveling vendor, and gives ads to a local tv channel which prefers to broadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect. his wife is not fond of his ways of doing business, they always quarrel, and ali threatens her that he may do very bad things in a moment of frenzy. in a very successful day, his lousy bike is stolen by the misbehaving little boys of the town. in search of his stolen bike, ali goes to the police, blames the big companies for the theft, but, of course, nobody takes him seriously. annoyed by the nagging of his wife, ali goes to a tavern and becomes drunk. one of his friends at his table, a wannabe socialist of the town, gives a didactic speech and criticizes globalism, and with no real connection, jumps to the subject of global freezing. ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison. his wife wakes up and prevents him. an old neighbor takes him to a night walk and advises him about life. according to him, ali can even sell hot sahlep drink if the world faces with global freezing. when he returns home, suddenly we see that his wife understood his value, treating him like a hero and praising his manhood. meanwhile, the thief boys got sick eating too much ice-cream. they confess to the doctor that they stole ali\\'s bike. ali forgives them and there comes the happy end. although the plot may look promising in a way, it\\'s the story-telling which makes this film insincere and cheesy. first, the director doesn\\'t show much of an effort to tell the story visually; everything is based on dialogs. and the dialogs never stop to show us that cinema is actually a visual art. even ali\\'s troubles are not convincing because we don\\'t see it, we just understand it from his words. the director markets his film as a righteous fight of ali against big ice-cream companies, but there is nothing in the film about big companies. we don\\'t see their pressure enough. the film actually ridicules ali for believing that big companies are behind the theft. and when his motorbike is found, it solves every problem: ali becomes a happy and powerful husband. not a real criticism of globalism. second, the film is cheesy because of the crude humor. maybe the people of that part of turkey is cursing so much and making so many vulgar jokes in their daily life, but vulgar language and crude humor are not enough to make a film funny. i may have accepted it if they were both vulgar and \"clever\" but they are not clever jokes at all, they are just cheesy. maybe i\\'m wrong, maybe american people may like oriental version of american pie style humor. but american pie never had any claim to be a nominee for the oscars, or to have a political message! if you think that you can laugh by just seeing a man\\'s big erection in his shorts (and we had to endure this joke twice!) or an old villager woman saying \"f**k you,\" then you may find this film funny. stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so i am happy to see any of their films. ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital, and with nothing else to do, stan decides to visit him, and take him some boiled eggs and nuts, instead of candy. chaos begins with stan curiously pulling ollie\\'s leg cast string, and manages to push the doctor (billy gilbert) out the window, clinging on to it, getting ollie strung up to the ceiling. when the situation calms down, stan gets ollie\\'s clothes, as the doctor wants them both to leave, and he also manages to sit on a syringe, accidentally left by the nurse, filled with a sleeping drug, which comes into effect while he is driving (which you can tell is done with a car in front of a large screen. filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad (although repetitive and a little predictable) classic comedy, it isn\\'t great, but it\\'s a black and white film worth looking at. stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians\\' comedian. okay! ok i have to admit that i quite enjoyed house of the dead despite its well documented failings. this however was the worst film i have seen since demons at the door. compared to datd the effects are vastly superior. however the plot is weak, the acting reminiscent of everyone\\'s favourite, the porn film, and the decisions and actions of the \"characters\" consistently verge on the moronic. i feel like trying out uwe boll\\'s latest cinematic outings just to get some sense of perspective over hotd2. i am not suggesting that he is really the cure, more a case of a different disease, but when your senses have been insulted in such an abhorrent manner the only way is up. ok there it is. i have managed the ten line minimum and shall waste no more of our time on the waste of celluloid that is house of the dead 2. i was -unlike most of the reviewers- not born in the 80\\'s. i was born on may 14th 1994. despite this, my life was very much in the style of the 80\\'s. when other kids had playstations, i was playing zelda on my nes etc. now, this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 years old at the time of writing this review. i, because of my 80\\'s style early childhood, watched many tv shows and saw many movies that other kids didn\\'t see, and this movie was one of those, and one of the greatest too. it starts off in the los angeles home of alvin seville, simon seville, theodore seville and david seville. david, the chipmunk\\'s adoptive father, is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around europe. his taxi is almost there and the chipmunks help him pack. while they are talking, alvin expresses his will to come with dave and to see the world (even though, technically dave is only going to europe, so to alvin, apparently only america and europe qualify as \\'\\'the world\\'\\'). david is leaving the chipmunks in the care of miss miller, much to the displeasure of the boys. soon dave is off to the airport and the chipmunks are left at home with miss miller. later, at a local cafã© the chipmunks are playing a game of \\'\\'around the world in 30 days\\'\\' against the chipettes(brittany, jeanette and eleanore). after losing the game to brittany after having his hot air balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile, alvin get\\'s in an argument with brittany about who would really win a race around the world. two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table, klaus and claudia furschtien overhear their argument and, needing a safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world, decide to fool the children into delivering them for them. they set up a race around the world, where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness (secretely filled with diamonds) at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing team\\'s likeness (secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds) to \\'\\'varify that they were there\\'\\'. the winning team would then receive a 100.000 dollar reward. they do this because they believe that jamal (an interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now) would never suspect them because they are just kids (however, this seems to be redundant, because on their travels, the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls, i suspect that neither would klaus or claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally.) and so begins a great adventure. this film is a classic and i see no reason why anyone would not like it. it features great animation and top-notch voice acting, not to mention the kick-ass music (pardon my french :p). my favorite song is without a shred of doubt \\'\\'the girls and boys of rock and roll\\'\\' an amazing rock song that cannot be topped. it\\'s also my favorite moment in the film. other notable songs include \\'\\'getting lucky\\'\\'(kind of suggestive for a kid\\'s film eh?) and \\'\\'my mother\\'\\' as well as \\'\\'wooly bully\\'\\' and \\'\\'off to see the world\\'\\' not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the royal london philharmonic orchestra. the scene with \\'\\'my mother\\'\\' still brings a tear to my eye. in relation to the song \\'\\'getting lucky\\'\\' i first didn\\'t think anything of it, but when i grew older and learned about life, it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive. that song, along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the chipettes panties. this is especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the chipettes are being chased by the arabian prince\\'s men, when eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely. while this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film, it\\'s one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4-feet tall chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high-pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child. anyway, a bit after that scene, the chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the chipmunks and get home. the direction of janice karman perfects this movie as she and her husband, ross bagdasarian jr. know the characters better than anyone. they even do the voices of the chipmunks and the chipettes. ross doing the voices for alvin and simon (as well as dave) and janice doing the voices for all the chipettes and theodore. speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses, nancy cartwright (the voice of bart simpson) makes an appearance in this movie. she plays the part of the arabian prince, a very small, but important role. the ending is of course, a happy one. the crooks have been caught, the loose ends tied and the film ends when the children, dave and miss miller are driving into the sunset, alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100.000 dollar reward for winning the race, which annoys dave until he finally yells \\'\\'alvin!\\'\\' and the screen fades to black classic ending, by the way. i hope you found my review of this movie useful, and if you haven\\'t seen this flick, give it a watch, it\\'s worth the money. this nostalgic classic from the 80\\'s gets a solid 10 out of 10. \\'\\'headin\\' for the top, don\\'t you know! we never stop believing now\\'\\' just when i thought i would finish a whole year without giving a single movie a \"bomb\" rating, a friend brought this notorious turd to my house last night. i feared the worst knowing its reputation, and it was as god-awful as i\\'d anticipated. this is a mexican-made mess, dubbed into english, and produced by k. gordon murray. it\\'s got terrible sets and effects, and features a rather frightening santa who doesn\\'t operate at the north pole, but instead from a cloud in outer space, and who doesn\\'t have little elves helping him make his toys but rather all different groups of children from practically every country there is. the opening sequence, where st. nick chuckles heartily as he observes monitors showing all these kiddies working hard while singing terrible holiday songs in a variety of languages, seems to go on forever, and with no story. obviously, this santa claus doesn\\'t observe the child labor laws! eventually we get some nasty and slinky red-suited apprentice of the devil himself traveling from hell to earth, just to make little kids naughty and turn santa\\'s christmas eve rounds into a nightmare. watching this movie is a trippy and twisted experience, and it\\'s bound to frighten little children and turn them off santa claus and the holidays forever. oddly, the name of jesus christ is mentioned often in this christmas film, which somehow makes it all the creepier in the context of all the bizarre things that are going on. this easily makes my personal list of the \"worst movie i\\'ve ever seen\", but i\\'m sure that\\'s nothing unique. as is often the case when you attempt to take a 400 plus page book and cram it into a two hour film, a lot is lost. here director john madden (shakespeare in love) takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off. what we get is a charming and emotionally compelling film that seems somehow incomplete. there is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic. the cinematography by john toll (cinematographer for braveheart and legends of the fall, winning oscars for both) is splendid. working with madden, the choices for locations on the greek island of kefallonia are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic locations in varying light are lush and beautiful. madden also uses numerous greek actors as the townspeople, giving the town an authentic feel. the soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the italian soldiers are marvelous. madden does an excellent job of bringing us the italian occupation and the romance, which take up the greater part of the film. there are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment. however, by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold, there isn\\'t much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and abbreviated. while the battle scenes are well done, subsequent to the battle it is obvious that increasingly greater compromises are being made to keep the film from running too long. by the time we reach the post war scenes, the treatment is merely skeletal. another negative is that the dvd is particularly sparse on features. nicholas cage is charming in the romantic lead as the sentimental captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight. when fight he must, cage switches gears seamlessly into a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains believable in both personas. penelope cruz, whom the camera loves, gives an uninspired performance as pelagia. in part this is because cage so dominates the screen, but cruz just seems too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic. she allows the character to be objectified as corelli\\'s love interest rather than establishing her as a powerful character in her own right. john hurt gives a fantastic performance as the wise old doctor, who knows as much about human nature as medicine. however, christian bale seems a bit overwrought and stiff as pelagia\\'s fiancã©. i rated this film an 8/10. despite some drawbacks, this is a touching film that is well worth seeing. the photography alone is worth the price of admission. my father grew grew up watching george reeves as superman and when i was a little kid he had episodes on vhs and let me view them including this movie (passing them down in the family if you will), and i loved it. clark kent and lois lane get sent to a small town with and oil mine and from the mine emerge mole men radioactive and targeted by the town assumed to be deadly and it\\'s up to superman to stop this mayhem. it\\'s just so wonderful and fun to view. the old style special effects and sound - the crew pulled off such a beauty with such little technology. george reeves was my hero when i was a little kid, and i\\'m 16 now, it just goes to show how timeless and classic these adventures are. this unpretentious horror film is probably destined to become a cult classic. much much better than 90% of the scream rip-offs out there! i even hope they come up with a sequel! i read the book before watching the movie and it left me emotionally drained but i felt that it truly transported me to afghanistan, a culture i know very little about. i had great hopes for this movie and it did not disappoint. i watched this with someone who didn\\'t read the book and he also enjoyed it. they had to shorten some things in the movie but it was a well acted and well shot film. it leaves you thinking about the movie long after it is over. you feel for the characters and their plights. i highly recommend this movie to those who like emotionally draining drama and want to experience afghani culture. there are some disturbing scenes not suitable for children to watch. it is a heavy drama depicting the horrors of life under a restrictive regime. years ago, sara, a young girl witnessed her parents being murdered, now as an adult she suffers from various mental ailments (did i mention she has an imaginary friend?) this film lulls the viewer, not into a sense of tension, mind you, but rather a sense of sleepiness. deathly boring, i found it hard to sit through as i could feel my eyelids growing heavier and heavier with each endless minute of mindless prattle and supposed \\'mystery\\'. is sara going crazy? or is it the paranormal? a better question would be, who cares? and the answer to that, no one. no one at all. skip this film, save yourself some time better suited to do other more worthwhile tasks. my grade: d- in short if you want to watch burt reynolds best films than this one must be included. if you don\\'t like burt you may still like this. if you love burt this may become one of your favorite movies of all time! being from atlanta it does hit home but it\\'s also nice to see a cop/action/drama that takes place somewhere other than ny city, chicago, miami, or la. the film is funny at points with & good plot & good performances from a great supporting cast (every character is real & the bad guys are not so one sided they are really well thought out)a nice offbeat romance in the 2nd half & it has some good old fashion shootouts & fistfights (no cgi thank god real action!) if clint eastwood did his best impression of a burt reynolds movie with \"every which way but loose\" & \"any which way you can\" then burt responded with his best clint type flick with this, & it comes off great! i have watched love jones over thirty times. it is one of the rare films that depict a love story about people who happen to be african-americans. the dialogue was realistically written, and delivered with honesty. it was so nice to see a film where the story line centered on young professional african-americans. this is virtually an untapped market. love jones was visually captivating as well. the chemistry between lorenz tate and nia long will bring memories of past and present love. the feeling of the film is jazz and blues, and brings to mine the sensuality of a warm creamy hot chocolate with a splash of kahlua and butterscotch. if you hadn\\'t guessed, i loved it! the basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menage-a-trois. fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this, using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists, invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience. it\\'s really rather messy though. fellowes doesn\\'t seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seat-edged. rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselves. the dialogue is inconsistent, stagey here, vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional clichã©-landmine. though there is no fussing over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score can\\'t create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces. there\\'s also a very prosaic, dare i say it british feel to the filming. i didn\\'t want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation, i wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story. finally it is, in fact, the story which lets the rest down. just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes, woven as a vehicle for character examination. wilkinson and watson support this meta-essay with good performances and john warnaby\\'s ebullient colleague simon to wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the brow-furrowing. i\\'m disappointed; not that it\\'s bad, but that it could have been much better. 3/10 this is absolutely the best movie i have ever watched. at the age of 12 i was up late and ran across the movie. it was on the usa channel, gilbert godfrey\\'s up all night. i will never forget. at the time my friends and i were really struggling with different issues, some sexual. you know 12 is a very rough and weird age. it seems you are stuck in between being a little girl, and being a young lady. this movie really helped to answer a lot of questions for me. i now have a daughter that is 12. have been searching for a couple years for this movie. if it ever does come out on dvd i would be the first to buy. would recommend for any parent to watch this with their child when they reach that very rough and difficult age. holes is an awesome movie. i love it a lot and it\\'s one of my favorite films. it\\'s one of the few flicks produced by disney that isn\\'t cheesy. holes is generally a very cool motion picture. i wish disney would make more pictures like it. holes is indeed a rare breed of disney flicker shows that is cool. don\\'t get the wrong idea, i don\\'t mean to bad mouth disney but most of it\\'s stuff is aimed towards kids and that\\'s okay. children deserve to have their entertainment too. but disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail. but not with holes. it\\'s the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think it\\'s corny. really, it\\'s the kind of movie that even a lot of young hoods might enjoy since there are characters in it that they can relate to. holes does a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment but not being too cheesy and living a little on the edge. i hope disney takes more risks and makes more edgy flicks like this. i cannot hate on the show. when the old (and better) tech tv had to hit the bricks, the channel was reformatted and new shows stepped in. \"attack of the show\" is the replacement for the screen savers, with 3 co-hosts in the beginning. they were kevin rose, kevin pereira and sarah lane. brendan moran came to be something of a co-host as well, but he mostly did prerecorded pieces for the show. kevin rose decided to leave the show, and eventually there was a contest to see who would be the third host, but that didn\\'t pan out for some reason. eventually (i just learned this from this very imdb messageboard) sarah lane and brendan moran moved on because (hey, this is what i read) the two got married. that was a big secret to me! now there is a new female co-host, the not-as-hot (my opinion) olivia munn. she\\'s hiding something in those tops she wears, while sarah lane had a perfect body and she wasn\\'t afraid to show it. ahem! sorry. \"attack of the show\" deals with everything young people want to know about. it\\'s music, movies, comic books, the internet and television. this is what\\'s great about the show. if you don\\'t want to bother with scouring the net or waste time watching mtv, you can get all you want on aots. some segments and bits they do are funny. they have regular guests and contributors who are in the industry, as well as guests who range from insignificant internet stars to actual big names. even though the hosts aren\\'t as geek as i\\'d like them to be, i still have found \"attack of the show\" to be entertaining, even with its latest lineup. worst dcom i have seen. ever. well, maybe not as bad as smart house. this was just bad. the acting and story was fine, but the effects sucked! they were so fake! the only good fight scene was between the brother and shen. that was probably the only scene in which i was excited. overall, i found this movie very boring and the film kind of ended suddenly. i will give it a four for brenda song who is a very funny actress and that one fight scene. 4/10 its awful i cant believe that one of the greatest nonsenses in the world can be a blockbuster and the favorite movie of millions of people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! a movie which has no story,again shahrukh khan has been appeared on the screen with nothing new the same as usual he is trying to make you cry by start scrambling his head for thousands of times,i think this is to much,pretty zinta spouse to act the character of a pakistani girl i didn\\'t know that there is enough facilities in pakistan for the pakistani girls to do so many plastic surgeries on their face and also there are enough make up facilities??!! and also i didn\\'t know that an indian can cross the march\\'s between both countries,go to pakistan and start dancing and singing may be pakistani soldier\\'s were sleeping!!!!!!!!! some people may call \"cooley high\" the same sort of thing as \"american graffiti\", but i wouldn\\'t. for starters, in \"ag\", everyone was white, whereas in \"ch\" they\\'re all black. moreover, this one has a motown soundtrack. specifically, the movie focuses on several working-class african-american students in 1964 chicago and their antics. the movie deals mainly with home life and relationships. in their apartments, we see that there\\'s never any dad around. but these young men always know how to live life to the fullest. one thing that really distinguishes this movie from most other portrayals of black people is that the teenagers in this movie are portrayed as very responsible, worrying about missing school. two really funny scenes are the gorilla scene, and the one white guy in the movie. but overall, the main star is the soundtrack. it is truly one of the best soundtracks in movie history (we even have it on vinyl here at home). a classic in the real sense of the word. so wonderful, so quirky, so romantic, so italian. the film is so feather -light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again. a kitchen sink world of bakeries, and hairdressers, and plumbing, but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence. should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction? take your pick -- they\\'re both faultless. let me get back to that new york city that lies just beyond the looking glass. this film is, quite simply, brilliant. the cinematography is good, the acting superb and the story absolutely breathtaking. this is the story of donald woods, a white south african who thought himself a liberal until he found out the reality of apartheid. kevin kline is completely convincing - so much so that when donald woods himself appeared on tv some years later, i recognised him from kline\\'s portrayal. denzel washington also turns in a masterful performance, as ever. i urge you to watch this. it is long, but it is worth your patience because it tells such an incredible story. remember, folks, this really happened. i have recently seen this production on dvd. it is the first time i have seen it since it was originally broadcast in 1983 and it was just as good as i remembered. at first as was worried it would seem old fashioned and i suppose it is a little dated and very wordy as the bbc serials were back then. (i miss those wonderful costume dramas that seemed to be always on sunday afternoons back then) but that aside it is as near perfect as it could have been. i am a bit of a \"jane eyre\" purist as it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is a faithful to the book as this one. i have recently re-read the book as well and some of the dialogue is just spot on. reading the scene near the end where rochester questions jane about what st john was like i noticed their words were exactly reproduced on screen by dalton and clarke and done perfectly. all the other productions that have been done all seem lacking in some way, some even leave out the \"rivers\" family and their connection to jane altogether. i also think this is the only production to include the \"gypsy\" scene done correctly. the casting is perfect, zelah clarke is like jane is described in the book \"small plain and dark\" and i disagree that she looked too old. timothy dalton may be a little too handsome but he is absolutely perfect as rochester, portraying every aspect of his character just right and acting his socks off! i agree with other comment that he even appears quite scary at time, like in the scene when he turns around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted, his expression is fantastically frightening. but then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see when jane runs down the stairs and into his arms the morning after they declare their love for one another. a love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable. oh to be loved by a man like that! there were a couple of scenes that were strangely missing however, like when jane climbs in to bed with the dying helen and also when rochester takes jane shopping for her wedding things (i thought that one was in it but maybe my memory is playing tricks). finally if you never see another production of jane eyre - you simply most see this one it is simply perfection! in a time of bad, if not plain awful, comedies, king of queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it\\'s a complete oxygen tank! it is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times. nothing has been this good since married with children. kevin james and jerry stiller are comic geniuses! and believe me, it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius. these guys truly understand what is funny. i could watch ten episodes of seinfeld and wouldn\\'t get half the laughs from seeing koq just once. other funny people in this show are carrie, janet heffernan, spence and doug pruzan (carrie\\'s boss). i\\'m so happy they managed to get so many seasons from this gem. the show has been a hilarious winner in a time of mostly comic losers. check it out if you haven\\'t!! prey aspect ratio: 1.37:1 sound format: mono a lesbian couple (sally faulkner and glory annan) living in a remote country house are driven apart by the arrival of a young man (barry stokes) who turns out to be a flesh-eating alien, the vanguard of a massive invasion... despite its shoestring budget and leaden pacing, norman j. warren\\'s follow-up to satan\\'s slave (1976) amounts to a great deal more than the sum of its meager parts, thanks to a surprisingly complex script by max cuff (apparently, his only writing credit): faulkner and annan indulge an obsessive relationship whilst living in isolated splendor within the english countryside (rendered alternately beautiful and ominous by derek v. browne\\'s eye-catching cinematography), though annan\\'s discovery of bloodstained clothing in an upstairs room marks one (or both) of these doe-eyed lovelies as psychologically disturbed, which may explain the absence of their respective families, some of whom appear to have lived in the house at one time or another and \\'left\\' under mysterious circumstances. stokes\\' unexpected arrival throws the relationship into disarray, partly because faulkner has a pathological hatred of men and partly because annan is attracted to him, creating tensions which result in a climactic whirlwind of violence. there\\'s an extraordinary, multi-layered sequence in which faulkner attempts to \\'emasculate\\' their clueless visitor by dressing him in women\\'s clothing, though stokes\\' alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockery. in the early scenes, at least, the relationship between faulkner and annan is depicted with uncommon grace and dignity, but this heartfelt sapphic liaison quickly devolves into crowd-pleasing episodes of sex and pulchritude, culminating in an explosion of horror when annan allows herself to be ravished by stokes following a violent argument with faulkner. the closing sequences are (quite literally) gut-wrenching, especially annan\\'s final scene, which appears to have been clipped for censorship reasons in 1977 and never fully restored (what remains is still pretty vivid, so brace yourselves!). excellent performances by the three leads, bolstered by warren\\'s unobtrusive direction, which takes full advantage of the stunning woodland locations, thereby compensating for the film\\'s budgetary shortcomings. originally released in the us as alien prey. the tourist season has just ended on a remote island off the coast of scotland, winter is beginning to set in and the inhabitants, both humans and sheep alike are settling down to much quieter times ahead. michael gaffikin (james warwick) a former paratrooper in the british army, is the local dentist, he\\'s not an islander by birth and as such his relationship with local artist and cartographer fiona patterson (celia imrie) is always being viewed with a little suspicion, not maliciously, but just out of the protective instincts the tight knit community have for their kin. the islands serenity is broken when gaffikin out for a solitary round of golf finds the headless remains of a brutally slain woman. he immediately reports his gruesome find to insp inskip(maurice roã«ves) at the islands police station, inskip arranges for delivery of the remains to local gp, dr goudry, for closer inspection. a quick search for the killer proves fruitless, as does a search for a missing local woman. over dinner that night with michael gaffikin, fiona realises that the dead woman might be sheila anderson, a woman from the mainland, who lives on the island through the winter months. a quick search at her home dove cottage reveals the missing remains of her body, her home proving to be the murder scene, but why did the killer drag her torso over a mile into the woods? suspicion immediately falls on the one stranger left on the island, one colonel howard (jonathan newth)who also happened be the last person to see her alive as they came across on the last ferry together. goudry asks gaffikin for some dental expertise on the victims body, it reveals that she had been torn apart my somebody or something with great strength, one set of teeth marks on the body seem to point at a human killer, another points to that of an unknown animal of some kind. a sheep is found mutilated and then a canadian ornithologist is found slain. with a heavy fog rolling in, the island is cut off from the mainland and any possibility of help, the radio also doesn\\'t work, seemingly being blocked and the phone lines have been cut. reports of ufo\\'s and the sighting of a camouflaged soldier are compounded by the finding of an odd looking craft hidden behind rocks on the beach. inskip is confused and refuses to listen to anything but the facts and laughs off gaffikin\\'s idea that aliens might be involved, but a rise in radioactive levels on the island, has him doubting himself. the nightmare man is based on the novel, child of the vodyanoi by david wiltshire, it is here adapted by dr who and blake\\'s 7 scriptwriter robert holmes and directed by douglas camfield who also had directing experience on both sci/fi classics and the film benefits from having such experienced genre experts on board. the nightmare man though is on the whole, a succinctly better crafted piece, that builds its plot alongside solid character development, even down to the minor characters, time is given to giving them all a firm background. the island setting is perhaps a genre clichã© that has been used over and over, but its one that i enjoy very much, the remoteness, the sense of being under siege with no way out always add to the atmosphere and here it is given an extra oomph by having an impenetrable fog close in to hamper all efforts. in many genre efforts of this kind it is very easy for proceedings to get silly and for the plot to resort to melodrama, but credit to camfield, he holds it all together with the emphasis being on believability at all times. there is an authenticity about proceedings, the characters even speaking gaelic at times to further this point. if there is one negative about the killer its that, we are given his/her/its pov for the killings, an acceptable clichã© on its own, but when seen through a red filter and a fish eye lens, it just screams of overkill and dates the film just a little. still though you will be hard pressed to guess the outcome or the identity or for that matter the species of the killer, given the clues presented, but it\\'s a fun and very well acted piece. the local scottish cast are exceptional, the local bobbies roeves and cosmo in particular spar well off each other and are a delight to behold. imrie, never one i\\'ve taken to in other works, is also pretty good and displays hew womanly physique as if she were in a hammer production. the outlandish, maybe even preposterous ending may irk some viewers, it disappointed me in some ways, but taking into account when it was made, its an understandable and acceptable addendum that if you think about it, is even more terrifying. this review also contains a spoiler of the first movie -- so if you haven\\'t seen either movie and want to but don\\'t want the spoilers, please don\\'t read this review! while this movie is supposed to be about christian and kathryn meeting for the first time, the movie is a poor copy of the first cruel intentions. the actors that they had portray ryan phillippe\\'s christian and sarah michelle gellar\\'s kathryn are very poor substitutes indeed. neither can pull off the smarmy, snooty rich-kid attitude that the original actors did. it\\'s absolutely appalling that some of the dialog was verbatim -- not so much between christian and kathryn, but if you listen closely enough you\\'ll recognize it. there are also inconsistencies in the plot - if this were truly the first meeting of christian and kathryn, then why is it that christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie? he supposedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie (with reese witherspoon\\'s character). also, the tie-in with the photography/\"you could be a model\" comment at the end was totally lame and didn\\'t add anything at all. overall, this movie was a waste of time. i can\\'t believe they made a cruel intentions 3. this movie is ridiculous. it\\'s attempting to be a comedy but the screenplay is horrible. the whole movie is done in low light and you cant grasp the fact that it\\'s a comedy. truly is bad cinematography. you really have to sit there and watch it to realize there\\'s a few jokes here and there going on but either way they\\'re all inside jokes amongst themselves. this is more like a wannabe drama flick that went bad. it really is a very pointless movie.their expressions reveal nothing but dismay and disaster which turns out that way anyway. unless you want to be bored out of your ass, i suggest you stay away from this gag of a movie. in dramatising wilde\\'s novel, john osborne has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown dorian\\'s essential wickedness. if you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. wilde and robert louis stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers. this story really treats of a theme similar to stevenson\\'s \"dr. jekyll and mr. hyde\", but note that wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas rls took the scientific route. both the protagonists are men in whom good wars with evil, with evil winning in the end. the actors in this bbc movie, take a different route, too, from those in the 1945 film. john gielgud says all the same caustic and cynical quips as george sanders, in his role really projecting wilde himself, but with a subtle difference. you\\'ll suspect that sanders really believed what he was saying, but gielgud may be saying what is expected of him rather than what he sincerely believes. peter firth, too, shows the two sides of his character in restrained fashion, but then we don\\'t get to see as many of his escapades as hurd hatfield had a chance to display. it\\'s a very good production, with the dramatisation reflecting the essentials of the novel, if not all of its ramifications. it starts out like a very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other clark movies like kids, bully, etc. but then just as quickly, it unravels into a direction-less mess. who is the main character? is this a serious film or some gregg araki-esquire over the top goofy film? is this a skate documentary with moments of dialog inserted? i have no clue. i found myself watching the clock and wonder when this turd was going to end. i kept thinking there would be some big shocker culmination which never came. i cut a good 20 minutes out of the movie by fast forwarding through the pointless skate scenes. yes, it illustrates the changing landscape between the have\\'s have not\\'s. i got it way back in the beginning. kids and bully was done in such a way that i actually felt like i was observing the realities of that group of friends. wassup felt very staged, poorly constructed and ever worse acting. teenage caveman, which larry didn\\'t write but did direct, was terrible. but at least it felt like it was suppose to be a terrible movie that didn\\'t take itself seriously. wassup rockers was just plain bad. this is my first deepa mehta film. i saw the film on tv in its hindi version with its \"sita\" character presented as nita. i also note that it is radha who underwent the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not nita/sita. yet what i loved about the film was its screenplay by ms mehta, not her direction. the characters, big and small, were well-developed and seemed quixotic towards the end--somewhat like the end of mazursky\\'s \"an unmarried woman.\" they are brave women surrounded by cardboard men. and one cardboard man (ashok) seems to come alive in the last shot we see of him---carrying his invalid mother biji. he seems to finally take on a future responsibility beyond celibacy and adherance to religion. ms mehta seems to fumble as a director (however, compared to most indian mainstream cinema she would seem to be brilliant) as she cannot use her script to go beyond the microscopic joint family she is presenting except presenting a glimpse of the chinese micro-minority in the social milieu of india. she even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter (not her father!) yet her radha reminesces of halcyon days with both her parents in a mustard field. compare her to mrinal sen, adoor gopalakrishnan, muzaffar ali and she is dwarfed by these giants--given her competent canadian production team and financial resources! mehta\\'s film of two bisexual ladies in an indian middle-class household may be sacrilege to some, but merely captures the atrophy of middle-class homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in a limited social space. kannada, malayalam, and bengali films have touched parallel themes in india but did not have the publicity that surrounded this film and therefore have not been seen by a wide segment of knowledgeable cinemagoers. ms das, ms azmi, mr jafri and mr kharbanda are credible but not outstanding. ms azmi is a talented actress who gave superb performances under good directors (mrinal sen\\'s \"khandar\", gautam ghose\\'s \"paar\", benegal\\'s \"ankur\") a brilliance notably absent in this film. ms das sparkled due to her screen presence rather than her acting capability. all in all, the film\\'s strength remains in the structure of the screenplay which is above average in terms of international cinema. i am sure ms mehta can hone her writing talents in her future screenplays. all the way though i was thinking to myself \"oh god why!\" at the very beginning i thought \"right it might be average,\" but the acting and plot on most parts was atrocious. every part in it was so predictable, even though the first movie seemed to bare a large resemblance to the ring, it was a half decent movie, but this just seemed to take all the good things about the first and made them terrible. some bits made everyone in the audience wet themselves, eg. the part were geller falls off the building had me in stitches. my girlfriend had to keep telling me to quiet down i was kept commenting on what was bound to happen next, and more times than less i was right. why does going into the house make her come after you, it doesn\\'t make sense. it was a poor excuse for a lot of killings, and no really depth was seen at all. you can see everything coming, which just left you feeling that there was no point in watching. oh shes behind her ... didn\\'t see that one coming *yawns*. surely these people must have thought to... oh i don\\'t know, carry a knife round or at least try and fight back, instead of being eaten but someone hair? at best during the movie i was very mildly scared (and i mean mildly), i was just crying out for the credits, as they rolled i exhaled a short \"oh thank god.\" if you haven\\'t already, don\\'t waste your\\' time and money on this; pointless, plot less, sorry excuse for a sequel! at 2:37, a high school student commits suicide. not shown who has taken their lives or reasons known, time skips back to the start of the day. from here we follow six separate students; marcus, melody, luke, steven, sarah and sean. each student is struggling with their own moral dilemmas, all reaching boiling point, hitting to an end for one. after losing a friend to suicide, and surviving his own suicide attempt, writer/director murali k. thalluri has created a revetting drama focusing on teen life and the horrible act of suicide. suicide has been a topic that has been kept in the shadows, 2:37 is thalluri\\'s attempt to bring it to light. if you have been touched by the act of suicide or anyone who has, 2:37 becomes all the harder to view. with heavy and hard subject matter, thalluri also tackles everyday teenage life crisis\\'s. sex, pregnancy, sexual identity, bullying, friendship, thalluri manages and shows them in an extremely realistic manner. the factor on thalluri\\'s talent is his subtlety. he respect his subject and the problems that everyone will have suffered through at sometime. it verges near documentary at times, it has such a painful realism; the interviews with each character spliced through the film only heightens this. 2:37 has a distinctive similarity to gus van sants film elephant. while the core of each film is different, both tackle teen life. like sant, thalluri utilizes long tracking shots, with time skipping back and forth, to show each characters interaction from different perspectives. a defining point to elephant was its ethereal ambiance. with spare conversation, little development of characters, and the long tracking shots, sant created a haunting and mesmerizing atmosphere to a coming dread. while there resides this dread in 2:37, the emotional connection to the characters reaches a higher level sant couldn\\'t reach. as time goes by, each characters fragility creeps out, dragging you along their emotional roller-coaster. the real hit in this film comes with the inevitable suicide, foretold at the very beginning. the hard part about this scene is the complete intrusion and discomfort we have as an audience watching someones life end in a gruesome fashion. though many films that have shown suicide, gloss over the act or romanticizes the act. thalluri shows the pain and agony involved with this act and that its not the best solution. with unknowns in the leads and their first major roles; teresa palmereach, frank sweet, joel mackenzie, marni spillane, charles baird and sam harris all show immense talent and promising acting careers. compelling and revetting, 2:37 is an absolutely unmissable film. the quote above just about says it all for \"slipstream\". i should have bailed out of this film after the first half hour, but decided i ought to be fair and give it a chance. i won\\'t watch it again, so if anyone with the temerity to do so can get back to me with the number of clichã©d lines in the movie, i\\'m sure it will set a record. some otherwise fine and talented actors got mixed up with this clunker; mark hamill portrays a futuristic bounty hunter and bill paxton is his quarry. paxton\\'s character has hijacked hamill\\'s prisoner, an android taking his name from the poet byron (bob peck). tasker (hamill) shoots owens (paxton) with a dart containing a tracking device so he and his companion belitski (kitty aldridge) can keep tabs on the pair. the real question though is why didn\\'t he just fire the device at byron thereby cutting out the middleman. if you enjoy scene after disjointed scene with tedious characterization and artsy fartsy pretense, then i suppose you\\'ll find something of interest here. but you can\\'t convince me that the film makes sense on any level. scenes of a futuristic stone age make way for high society snobbery, but the pinnacle of poor taste is reached when paxton\\'s character is displayed following a night of revelry with hickeys all over his torso. if anyone thinks there\\'s some hidden meaning here, you\\'re really stretching. patiently waiting for the frame proclaiming \"the end\" to come into view, alas, even that was denied. if beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then so is understanding; this movie had neither. yet there was a single redeeming feature as the closing credits began their run - an awesome view of a half dozen hot air balloons. apparently the film was keeping them afloat. director edward sedgwick, an old hand at visual comedy, successfully leads this hal roach road show which tenders a fast-moving and adroit scenario and excellent casting, employing a large number of roach\\'s reliable performers. although the film was originally plotted as a vehicle for patsy kelly, sunny jack haley stars as joe jenkins, a young kansan who sells his auto repair business and journeys to hollywood, where he attempts to wangle a screen role for the girl he loves, star-struck cecilia (rosina lawrence). sedgwick, who prefers using the entire m-g-m studio as his set, does so here as cecilia, always ready for an audition, is treated by a would-be paramour, cinema star rinaldo lopez (mischa auer), to behind-the-scenes action of, naturally, a musical comedy, featuring broadway headliner lyda roberti. laurel and hardy provide several enjoyable interludes, including their well-known skit involving a tiny harmonica, and we watch fine turns by such as joyce compton, russell hicks and walter long. on balance, one must hand the bays to mischa auer, who clearly steals the picture as an emotional movie star, a role which he largely creates, and to the director for his clever closing homage to busby berkeley\\'s filmic spectacles. the jokes are obvious, the gags are corny, and the characters are walking characatures - but i couldn\\'t stop from laughing at his highly entertaining movie. no matter how many times i see it, i still get a kick out of this one, and i recommend it highly for all lovers of mindless entertainment. it contains many quotable moments, and some of the best sight-gags i\\'ve seen to this day. if you\\'ve had a bad week and you need a chuckle, rent this one on your way home friday night to give your weekend a good start. these slasher pics are past their sell by date, but this one is good fun. the valentine cards themselves are witty, and well thought out. the film has one peach of a line... \"he\\'s no angel....\" when he in fact is angel!!! watching buffy reruns will never be the same! the cast is a sizzling display of young talent, but the story does not give them enough real depth. denise richards on the dvd extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters. sorry but no! the direction is very good, managing to show very little actual gore, and relying on your imaginations implied threat. much can be said also for the similar manner in which miss richards and heigel do not remove their clothes...:-( essentially, the main directorial plus, lies within the \"borrowing\" of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks. psycho\\'s shower scene is tributed, along with halloween\\'s \"masking\". murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as i know!!! light viewing, not very scary but a few good jump moments. if it was a choice between the hole and this though, choose the hole. slasher movies have had their day, and this is just another slasher. a very good slasher, but nothing groundbreaking!!! the only reason i gave this episode of \"masters of horror\" a 2 instead of a 1 is because the two lead actors are good, and it wasn\\'t shot on vhs. the story, the dialog, and the plot are ridiculous. talking / driving zombies who come back to vote and sway the political tide against the war! give me a break! what next, zombies who come back to go skydiving? maybe zombies who come back to host qvc shows? i never supported the iraq war, but i do support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces; and \"homecoming\" was disrespectful in that it mocks the true horror of war. with zombies being mass produced in today\\'s market... this is the spam of zombie-related entertainment. how \"homecoming\" made it onto \"masters of horror\" is beyond me. like most, i thought \\'another crocodile movie\\'. so far we\\'ve had primeval and rogue in the last 12 months, what can they do that\\'s new? where both those films were about action and violence, this one\\'s about fear and tension. the performances aren\\'t oscar-worthy when there\\'s nothing going on, but in times of distress or terror, these people suffer so much it\\'s like torture. there are holes in the plot and maybe crocs don\\'t really behave like this as others have pointed out, but the fear is so effective it\\'s a stretch to say you\\'ll enjoy this movie. it\\'ll leave you feeling as uncomfortable as the passion of the christ. there are a couple of prior comments here which opine about this flick\\'s abundance of clichã©s throughout -- and i agree completely, both with regard to the characters and the dialog. i\\'d read about elizabeth berkly\\'s awful performance in the equally-awful \"showgirls,\" which i\\'ve never seen - and her performance here, while not awful, is barely up to the standards of lifetime\\'s worse fare. there was not a hint of depth to her character, but then there probably shouldn\\'t have been. if so, it would have placed the film completely out-of-balance, since there wasn\\'t a hint of depth or charisma - not a trace - in any one character, performer, or portrayal. the principal\\'s handling of liz\\'s initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall was laughable. her husband\\'s initial reaction and advice were likewise (forrest gump, attacking jenny\\'s boyfriend in his car provided a more realistic, intelligent action, and, hell, he was mentally-challenged). the smarmy, unctuous lawyer (excuse the redundancy) father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance: he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time, no mean feat. her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd, also not unknown in the profession. finally (and frankly, i rather enjoyed this part), the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs, that you\\'d rather depend upon barney fife, without andy, to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community. i know that most real-like cops fall a bit short of the sharpness, intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the \"law and order\" series\\', and the like -- but dolts of this level seem to be a staple on \"lifetime.\" finally, i found a kind of \"story within a story\" fascination with josh\\'s concoction of his being the \"victim\" of his teacher. this scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story. this was something of an achievement, like going from \"f\" to \"f-minus.\" this whole lame situation should have been resolved - in real life - in about 15 minutes, following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities, with husband involved. but then that would have precluded the contrived drama following, and left an hour\\'s blank film in the camera. but the writer(s) here, proved with their ending, they could do even worse. when the situation was finally \"resolved\" and \"righted,\" this was accomplished in all of about 45 seconds, with no indication of what measures might have been forthcoming in any \"real world\" context for the perpetrator and his parents, or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemption. this one\\'s a 2* presentation; the second \"*\" because it does have some mild \"fascination.\" if you haven\\'t seen this yet, you really should, on dvd. i can\\'t believe how much i enjoyed it! it is amazingly realistic and believable. true, much of it is speculated, and i would have liked to have known more about what was speculative and what were proven facts (there aren\\'t many of them), but it handles everything quite well with a \"cruel mother nature\" theme. it will remind you of the nature programs that you\\'ve seen on animal planet and the discovery channel, only the animals here are dinosaurs. they act natural; they eat, kill, mate, play, and fight for survival. you will actually find yourself rooting for some of them and against others. for the most part, the effects are excellent. at times they will look a little too much like cgi\\'s, but then you will see them in a different angle that makes them look more realistic. in some cases, you will actually be convinced that you\\'ve seen a dinosaur. my favorites were the coelophysis, the raptors, the diplodocus, the iguanadons, the allosaurus and the arctic bipeds. i was most disappointed with the t-rex, however, which looked a little too computer generated at times. in any case, you should definitely see this production. it is educational, well made, and very entertaining. for what it is, its an a! why is it that canada can turn out decent to good movies in every genre, other then action? i caught dragon hunt on tv the other day and it was like a train wreck. i just could not change the channel, it\\'s sheer stupidity sapped my willpower. its pretty telling that the cast imdb \"credits\" with this monstrosity apparently never worked again. bad acting, bad writing, bad narration, bad music, bad hair, bad cinematography. it just goes on and on. the movie really has nothing to recommend it. if you\\'re looking for bad action films to enjoy by laughing out, there are a tonne of other films that won\\'t require you to scorch out your retinas afterwards. i hope this film didn\\'t get money from the government for financing, otherwise i\\'m never paying taxes again. ab tak chhappan is a fictitious story surrounding a police department in mumbai, india. sadhu agashe is a hard working, hard-edged cop heading up a plain clothed crime squad who makes a name for himself by killing dangerous criminals in staged police encounters rather than locking them up in prison. his loyal officers obey him without question but a rift forms when one of his officers, imtiaz, becomes frustrated by sadhu\\'s high ranking status and is secretly competing with him for criminal kills and status. a new recruit is also pushed into the fraternity and imtiaz is angry when sadhu allows him to take the lead on his first case. further change comes in the form of a new police commissioner who disapproves of sadhu\\'s tactics and everyone gets caught up in internal politics. i was surprised to see such a well directed action thriller coming from india. the camera work is excellent, the story is well told and the tension is high when the drama unfolds. the acting, pace and political subterfuge convinces the viewer that they are a fly on the wall witnessing the blood, sweat and tears from a close up and personal view and that the events are based on reality which is no doubt why we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film although it is likely that the director, shimit amin, has taken liberties with factual accounts. nevertheless, ab tak chhappan is an extremely polished piece of film-making. let\\'s keep it simple: my two kids were glued to this movie. it has its flaws from an adult perspective, but buy some jelly-worms and just enjoy it. and the pepsi girl was excellent! and kimberly williams was pretty gosh-darned hot, although she\\'s not in the film very much, so don\\'t get too excited there. not that\\'s it\\'s really a bad thing, but it is the kind of movie you watch just once. don\\'t buy the dvd. enjoy! did i mention kimberly williams? (that was for the dads.) it was 1 a.m. in the morning and i had nothing else to do. don\\'t judge me... please. we\\'re back in time during the spanish settlements. a group have made their way onto an island. it doesn\\'t take too long before they encounter a large \"reptile\", which gobbles up their horse. soon they\\'re captured by the natives and in order to gain freedom they must kill the \"reptile gods.\" the cg sucks; it reminds me of the cg of early console video games. the encounters were lame. the only positive thing i have to say about this was the hottie native running around in a skimpy outfit. otherwise it\\'s just a middling effort. lackawanna blues is and excellent movie. the casting was perfect. every actor and actress was perfectly suited for the role they played. their chemistry together was amazing. the acting was superb. i felt as if i knew the characters. i could almost \\'feel\\' them. they reminded me of people that i knew as a child growing up in the 50\\'s and 60\\'s. oh, the memories!! my personal belief is that this movie should have been on the big screen for all to see. i have watched this movie so many times, that i can almost recite the lines as the characters are saying them. i can\\'t even list my favorite part, because i have so many favorite parts. thank you for bringing back a part of my youth that i never see in this day and age...and that is black people loving each other, looking out for each other, respecting each other, caring about each other, and doing all we can to help each other. gotta go now. i have to go watch it again. saturday june 3, 6:30pm the neptune monday june 5, 4:30pm the neptune few celebrations of ethnic and cultural identity succeed as mightily as carlos saura\\'s brilliant interpretation of isaac albeniz\\' masterpiece iberia suite. at the approach of its centennial, saura drew together an unprecedented wealth of talent from the spanish performing arts community to create this quintessential love song to their homeland. the twelve \"impressions\" of the suite are presented without narrative in stark surroundings, allowing the power of each performance to explode before saura\\'s camera. creative use of large flats and mirrors, moved throughout the set, combined with screens, shadows, fire, rain and rear projection add glorious dramatic effects to the varied selections of song, dance and instrumental performance. photographs of albeniz reappear throughout the program, connecting the passion of the music to its great creator. saura encompasses all spaniards on his stage from the beautiful elegance of elderly flamenco dancers in traditional costume to children joyously dancing with their instructors. as most people i am tired of the by the numbers clichã©d movies that hollywood makes. there seems to be no creativity in hollywood. companies only want to spend money on remakes are sequels that have an audience built in. this movie is a welcome change. it could be classified as romantic comedy for it\\'s genre but don\\'t let that turn you off this movie. this is a very original movie which is not like most things hollywood produces. if you are reading this, you already know the basic plot so i will not bother going over that. the only movies that come to mind to compare this to are \"interstate 60\" and \"art of travel\" which are little known gems that take a different path than most of the hollywood garbage. this is well worth seeing if you are tired of watching more of the same. dean many of the reviews and comments i have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by clara bow. although the story-line was rather typical of clara\\'s later silents, i still find it somewhat heart-stirring and incredibly fun. clara plays a happy-go-lucky hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves...never mind that this man is married! clara\\'s lack of modesty was shocking in the day, but i believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie. though definitely not a brilliant story-line (quite typical, actually), this movie is a nice showcase of clara\\'s ability to make the audience laugh. as the number of video nasties i\\'ve yet to see dwindles, this little pile of garbage popped up on my \"to rent\" list when i saw it was available. the premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots. some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip, though if he returns with the girl and all the money, he gets a significant cut. he\\'s brought a helicopter and pilot with him and, wow, that pilot is one of the worst actors ever! granted, they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood. after stealing away into the jungle, we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human king kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour. now, this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever, ping-pong balls for eyes and that\\'s pretty much it. his growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack, and i found myself muting much of those scenes. oh, did i forget to mention the almost constant nudity? this is probably the main reason this film was banned, though there is one specific scene, about one second long, where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out, but it\\'s not a redeeming factor for gore fans. also, jess franco goes beyond the usual t and a and shows lengthy close-ups of female genitals, and, sadly, male as well. so, if you want \"fair\" in terms of exploitation, you got it. i can\\'t recommend this trash to anyone. it\\'s not even the good bad movie. it\\'s just atrociously padded trash that only a video nasty fan will probably view and even then, if you are making your way through the list, leave this for the very last. if you watch it first, you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true. i rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case. judge and jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun, but this movie got progressively stupider as it went on. david keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent. judge and jury was well plain dumb i gave it a 3 should have gave it a 2, i gave it an extra star just because david keith\\'s gun was cool. i found out about this film because jewish ben chaplin from game on was in it. game on is a funny british sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break into hollywood and star in this film. he failed thank god. the film is a very simple romantic comedy with janeane garofalo playing an ugly woman who uses her neighbour uma thurman to date ben chaplin because she thinks ben chaplin won\\'t like her because she\\'s ugly. the film is just bad for so many reasons. the plot is unbelievably predictable from the overtly slapstick bits to the serious mushy bits: ugh just that montage where all three of them are having fun and then the photograph bit. those two scenes made me cringe! janeane\\'s character is sickeningly arrogant (and guessing from her role as stand-up \"comedienne\" and arch-feminist is in real life too). she claims that the film is \"anti-feminist\" when in fact it\\'s just realistic. men more often than not go for looks over personality. it\\'s interesting to note her hypocrisy too. she\\'d been a feminist and \"comedienne\" for years before taking this role and then suddenly decides afterwards that the film was bad. i imagine she hated the idea and script of this film before it was released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a film. i mean come on! she acted in it for heaven\\'s sake! what this film was really was anti-men if anything. it portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their groins with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of uma thurman\\'s character noelle. there are other bad things about this film too like ben chaplin\\'s character being the british man every american girl finds cute and jamie foxx being the token black best friend of chaplin and of course foxx had to try and mimic his accent a few times for good measure. is that the best the script writers could come up with? blimey they\\'ve never done that before except with every hugh grant and dudley moore film ever made. there\\'s also a truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is. the other comments on here all say how janeane garofalo isn\\'t ugly but is actually beautiful. erm was i watching the same film as they were? she\\'s certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightly cast as the ugly one. although having said that, i fail to see the appeal of uma thurman as well: she\\'s lanky and gaunt looking. i guarantee three things about this film if you\\'ve never watched it: you will know what the ending will be; you will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing and; you will be bored after ten minutes. watch at your own peril. this movie has everything typical horror movies lack. although some things are far fetched we are dealing with quality snow man engineers. the only preview i can reveal is that i cant wait for jackzilla. dare i say oscar winner. this is a perfect date movie. i advise all men for a nice romantic surprise see this movie with that special person. having just seen walt disney\\'s the skeleton dance on the saturday morning blog as linked from youtube, i used those same sources to watch a remake done in technicolor for the columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man-ub iwerks. the colors, compared to the earlier black and white, are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gags-like when one of the skeletal band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another one\\'s off or when one dances with the other with part of that other gone-are just as funny as the previous short. it does get a little repetitious near the end. still, skeleton frolics is well worth seeing for any animation buff who wants to compare this with the earlier silly symphony. the cast of this film contain some of new zealander\\'s better actors, many of who i have seen in fabulous roles, this film however fills me with a deep shame just to be from the same country as them. the fake american accents are the first clue that things are about to go spectacularly wrong. as another review rather astutely noted the luxury cruise ship is in fact an old car ferry, decorated with a few of the multi colour flags stolen from a used car lot. most of the cast appear to be from the (great) long running new zealand soap shortland street. it\\'s as if this movie was dreamt up at a shortland street cast christmas party, the result of too many gins, and possibly a bit of salmonella. imagine \"under siege\" meets \"the love boat\", staged by your local primary school and directed by an autistic and you get the idea. if you are an actor, i recommend you see this film, as a study on how to destroy your carer. emily watson and tom wilkinson together - what a treat! with rupert everett and linda bassett rounding off the supporting roles to the foursome of lies and intrigue. yet at the heart of it all, each character maintains a streak of decency - moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions. \"contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life.\" how true these words are. watson\\'s anne manning is at the core of this intrigue - she\\'s the central conscience that the other three latched on. she is the decency undeterred. the circumstances of lies are to each its own: one to defend one\\'s professional name; one to hold back due to family/partner pressure; one simply don\\'t want to face the consequence; one ironically can\\'t believe the truth and lies to save friendship. these are all precarious situations. there lies the intrigue - fascinating to watch how each tackles truth and lies. contradictions, indeed. in spite of the seeming dishonor, decency and heart remain strong. the treatment of the subject involved and how each of the character behaves are masterfully delivered simple with clarity. it\\'s not sensational or complex as another film \"where the truth lies\" 2005. credits due to fellowes\\' writing and the nuanced performances of both watson and wilkinson. there is warmth somehow that comes through the seemingly boldface or frustratingly hidden lies. beneath it all, human frailty not excluded, they meant well. and following along with the story, the turn of events provided satisfaction and smiles to how the two manning\\'s seem to have grown and matured in their relationship. you might say there\\'s no obvious action drama or thrilling scenes in \"separate lies,\" yet the intrigue is there and it will hold your attention. the deserving production efforts include cinematography by tony pierce-roberts (a veteran to the merchant-ivory films) and music by stanislas syrewicz, with mood and tone reminiscent of composer zbignew priesner (of filmmaker krzysztof kieslowski\\'s trois couleurs, especially: bleu 1993.) this is a british film you just might not want to miss. emily watson (anne, the wife): breaking the waves 1996 debut; hilary and jackie 1998; the luzhin defence 2000; gosford park 2001; punch-drunk love, red dragon, equilibrium in

2004, recently as father moore in: the exorcism of emily rose 2005 opposite laura linney. rupert everett (bill): he is simply delightful in \"my best friend\\'s wedding\" 1997 opposite julia roberts

to tell the truth is rottentomatoes.com. this film is awful. the plot is extremely lazy. it is not scary either. people out there who think that because it stars sarah michelle geller it is somehow like the grudge should forget about it. this film is more like dark water, except it is even more predictable and slow moving than it. i was extremely disappointed with this film. it didn\\'t scare me nor interest me either. let\\'s face it , this type of plot has been flogged to death at this stage e.g. the dead trying to contact the living - dragonfly, what lies beneath, ghost story, dark water, darkness, the changeling etc.etc. it seems to me that the only ones writing original horror films nowadays are the japanese and the koreans. the films that are coming out of hollywood, like this, are cynical exercises in money making without a shred of respect for the viewer. they\\'re just being churned out angela (sandra bullock) is a computer expert but, being shy and somewhat of a recluse, she does all of her work from the confines of her condo. just as she is about to take a vacation in mexico, a co-worker sends her a computer disc with disturbing information on it. angela agrees to meet with her fellow employee but he mysteriously dies in a plane crash. angela heads to mexico but takes the disc with her. while she is sunning on the beach, a terrific looking gentleman named jack (jeremy northam) makes overtures to her. she falls for them and the two end up on a boat to cozumel. however, jack works for the folks who generated the secret information on the disc and he is out to get it. even after angela escapes from his clutches and lands back in the usa, jack makes things difficult. he changes angela\\'s identity on every computer across the nation, making her lose her condo, her bank account, everything. can angela, a computer whiz, beat jack at his own game? this very exciting movie has many assets. first, bullock and northam are two very beautiful, interesting actors and their presence adds immediate captivation. the script is very clever and sure in its knowledge of the capabilities of computers and their relevance in today\\'s world. the costumes, sets, production, and direction of the movie are also quite wonderful. and, despite how it sounds, there is a great deal of exciting action as angela goes on the run to defeat her enemy. if you love thrillers without unnecessary bloodshed or violence, this is a great choice. it delivers twists and turns with great frequency, making it possible for the viewer to \"net\" a very good evening of entertainment. i rented the dvd in a video store, as an alternative to reading the report. but it\\'s pretty much just more terror-tainment. while the film may present some info from the report in the drama, you\\'re taking the word of the producers - there\\'s no reference to the commission report anywhere in the film. not one. the acting, all around, is pretty bad - pretty much all of the stereotypes of \\'hot shot\\' bitchy foul mouthed government agents, each thinking they know more than everyone else. there may be some truth to it, but it really has a bad hollywood stereotype smell to it. imdb\\'s user community ratings & comments tend to be more right than wrong, and i have started to glance at the ratings before renting whenever i can. i wish i had on this one. look, this is a low budget horror film that suffers from all of the problems that go with low budget movies. but you must see this just to watch lisa erickson as julie. she is smokin\\' hot and a great little actress to boot! these types of horror movies often unearth a rare gem and the power gave us lisa erickson! nothing i enjoy more than sitting down in my studio apartment with a coke and putting in this film. my friends bob, bill and dennis agree.. lisa is not only brilliant, she is a hottie. the movie itself often plods along and the rest of the actors are not very helpful in that regard. but as soon as lisa hits the screen, things really start hopping. the others are clearly not in her league. this is not the exorcist but as i said, if you want to see a fun little movie with a hot little actress, this is the one to see! it wasn\\'t until i looked at the trivia section that i found out that the original producer/star of this movie tyrone power died during its making . this no doubt explains why everyone on screen seems to have their minds on other things , a symptom of which appears in a very early scene involving a battle that can only be described as pathetic . you know when you\\'ve been painting a wall until you\\'re completely bored ? well that\\'s the sort of expression the combatants have on their face when they\\'re swinging their swords in a highly unconvincing manner the plot centres on soloman the king of israel having an affair with the queen of sheeba and his people not being happy about it . you can\\'t really blame them since there\\'s few things more beautiful in the world than those israeli moteks , though the israeli women here all seem to look like cherie blair ! modern day israel is also very cosmopolitan with the majority of israelis being born outside the country but would this have been true a couple of thousand years ago where everyone speaks in european and american accents after much talking and a dance sequence that has to be seen to be believed ( and no that\\'s not praise ) we have a climax where the heavily outnumbered israelis have to defend themselves against a massed egyptian army who can\\'t read a map otherwise they would have known there was a canyon in front of them . this is what i don\\'t get - even though their blinded by the sun the egyptians spend ten minutes charging towards the israelis never ever realising they\\'re charging towards a gaping ravine ! isn\\'t this somewhat illogical ? it\\'s also something of a revealing error since the horses , chariots and men falling into the canyon are obviously miniature figures anyway the film ends with soloman killing his treacherous brother and praising god for his victory . but who needs moshe dayan , arik sharon or god when you\\'ve got an idiotic enemy who can\\'t see a ravine in front of him or waves a sword like he paints a wall ? i am a huge woody allen fan and so when i saw that this was playing at the cinema i couldn\\'t help myself. i wanted to see how allen would follow up his magnificent film match point seeing as this is another one of his films shot in g.b. (which is unique among allen\\'s work) along with what seems to be his new muse scarlett johanson. scoop is much lighter than mp and the humor is scoop\\'s most enjoyable aspect. the plot revolves around johanson\\'s character (a journalism student) who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave. she falls in love with a suspected serial killer (jackman) and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding. oh and all of this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by allen. i must say that i thoroughly enjoyed johanson\\'s performance but i am a bit bias, i could watch a three hour film with johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted. she plays a ditsy, yappy, bumbling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of allen\\'s stereotypical neurosis stricken character. she adds appropriate body language for comic effect. needless to say almost anyone who sees this will find johanson\\'s character sickeningly cute and that is a plus. allen is allen... he is still playing the same character much like chaplin and his little tramp character. something that occur in this film makes me wonder if i will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however. he is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of late... jackman is also enjoyable as the suave, millionaire murder suspect. i cannot say that jackman does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the less. in terms of the plot i cannot help but feel that this is fresh... in fact it stinks of curse of the jade scorpion. johanson and allen are more detective-like than anything. however i must applaud allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding hollywood version of this film. instead of everything being black and white, things are painted in shades of gray. being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does unequivocal guilt. though the plot seemed old woody still has a knack for one liners. i did find his allusions to his last film interesting... come for the humor, laugh and be merry. needless to say if you enjoy allen\\'s work watch it. if not watch something else... i rented this film because of my interest in american history, and especially the somewhat weird story of the mormons. this movie attempts to make some sense out of how joseph smith could turn his \"vision\" into a major world religion. it first focuses on the troubles the mormons had in their settlement at navuoo, illinois. it portrays the trial of joseph smith. within the course of that trial, brigham young stands up to tell of his conversion to mormonism, and of his belief in the spiritual message of smith. then smith is assassinated, and young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the mormons to a new land. despite his grave doubts, he perseveres, and finally has a vision (that utah is the place for his colony) that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership. later, as crops are destroyed by crickets, he again doubts that he has truly been chosen--however, a miracle occurs, which cements his place in history. i found the performances to be moving, and the story to be convincing and interesting. i would love to know whether mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal. polygamy is a part of the story, but the reasons why this is central to lds are not raised. the issue is not emphasized. i\\'m sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subject-matter, but it has a great cast and will hold your interest throughout. 1983\\'s \"frightmare\" is an odd little film. the director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of classic \\'30s/\\'40s style horror movies with the shock factor of the then-exploding \\'80s slasher genre. it isn\\'t totally successful (mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraints, and the less-than-professional caliber of its cast of young actors) but it still has its moments, mostly due to the classy performance (classier than the movie deserves) by the late german actor ferdinand mayne, who plays an aging old time horror movie star (ala vincent price) named \"conrad ratzoff.\" at the beginning of the movie we meet the has-been horror star as he\\'s shooting a commercial for dentures and we quickly learn that ol\\' conrad is a bit of a hoity-toity, prima donna jerk-off. just when you think he couldn\\'t be any more un-likable, the commercial director berates conrad for blowing a take for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him off a balcony to his death. nice, huh? conrad then visits some fans at a college campus horror movie club, unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up back at his mansion waiting to die. still feisty even at death\\'s door, he manages to do away with a despised business associate by smothering him with a pillow before he finally kicks the bucket himself. conrad is then laid to rest in true hollywood style in a high tech neon tomb with video screens above the casket, which will play personal video messages from conrad himself for visitors who enter to pay their respects. it is at this point that the kids from the college horror movie society decide to pay conrad\\'s grave an after hours visit, breaking into the tomb and taking his body back home with them for an all night party. (not exactly my idea of fun, but hey, these are characters in an \\'80s horror film. logic has no place here.) the college kids spend the evening having dinner with conrad\\'s body seated in a place of honor, posing for photos with it and even dancing around the room with it, before parking conrad and his coffin in the attic, planning to return him to his crypt in the morning. in the meantime, mrs. ratzoff, distraught over the theft of her husband\\'s body, has called in a psychic friend to try and \"reach\" conrad through a seance. you can pretty much figure out the rest from here. since conrad wasn\\'t a very nice guy in life, it\\'s not much of a stretch to assume that he won\\'t be any friendlier in death. psychic lady makes contact with conrad and he re-awakens in predictably ticked off fashion, then spends the rest of the movie strolling around the corridors of the students\\' ridiculously huge house, picking off the young grave robbers one by one. this is where the movie falls apart. endless scenes of teens wandering around empty hallways saying \"hello? is anyone there?\" are intercut with occasional bursts of violence (we do get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene, which is the highlight of the movie) before the last two survivors finally figure out (way later than any semi-intelligent people would have figured out the same thing...but again, we\\'re in an \\'80s horror film!) that the only way to stop the mayhem is to get conrad\\'s body back to its crypt where it belongs. the sluggish pacing is padded out with a lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effects backed by a soundtrack made up almost entirely of sound effects rather than music(thunder, moans and groans, howls, etc.) that becomes severely annoying after a while. i can\\'t really recommend \"frightmare\" to anyone who didn\\'t grow up watching cheap movies like this on late night cable back in the \\'80s. \"modern horror\" fans will doubtlessly find \"frightmare\" incredibly slow moving and goofy. if you came of age in that magical decade, however, you may get a blast of nostalgia from \"frightmare.\" fans of jeffrey (\"re-animator\") combs may also want to check it out, as the future dr. west appears in an early role here as one of the unlucky film students. i will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the eastwestdvd label (paired with roy ward\\'s \"vault of horror\" and sold at dollar stores) because the print quality is terrible. i\\'m told the film has gotten a deluxe release via the fine folks at troma, which seems appropriate. if you\\'re a troma kind of person then \"frightmare\" will be right up your alley. people watch movies for a variety of different reasons. this movie didn\\'t have the big budget, there\\'s no special effects, no car chases and there\\'s no explosions. actually reality doesn\\'t have much of these either. at least not in my life. this is a very real movie about very real people, none of them perfect in any way but together they are put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that in turn makes order out of chaos. i am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology, since i\\'m neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own brain. so watch this movie for the characters. it is brim-full of a whole cast of wonderful quirky folk. within the first three minutes kiefer sutherland enacts detective michael hayden\\'s life superbly and he keeps developing the character throughout the movie. excellent acting, very believable. henry czerny could not have been cast better and the rapport between his \\'harvey\\' and kiefer\\'s \\'mickey\\' enhances the oppositeness of their characters. i thoroughly enjoyed the cranky landlady, \\'mrs ramsay\\', i\\'m sure she and my mother-in-law are good friends!!! there\\'s a host more of these wonderful characters but space is limited here so watch the movie and enjoy them. i think that you can not imagine how these people really work...!! before i came to the studios to watch the guys work there, i actually thought quite the same as you do. but since i saw and did the work the guys on that tv-show have to do, i have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long. that really is no easy work. and also the actors, which in your eyes may be terribly bad, are really great people and a lot of them really can act! i don\\'t think that the material given to them can really show that, as i think this material isn\\'t very good. but they are truly good! so i don\\'t think that you, before you haven\\'t seen these guys doing there work, can judge over them! and i shouldn\\'t have judged over them as well before i met them, but i did and am now terribly ashamed of it. so please, do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you haven\\'t seen them doing there job. as usual, i am making a mad dash to see the movies i haven\\'t watched yet in anticipation of the oscars. i was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up my alley. i can not for the life of me understand why this movie has gotten the buzz it has. there is no story!! a group of guys meander around iraq. one day they are here diffusing a bomb. tomorrow they are tooling around the countryside, by themselves no less and start taking sniper fire. no wait here they are back in bagdad. there is no cohesive story at all. the three main characters are so overly characterized that they are mere caricatures. by that i mean, we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying. we have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safe. and then we have the daredevil cowboy who doesn\\'t follow the rules but has a soft spot for the precocious little iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers dvds. what do you think is going to happen??? well, do you think the cowboy soldier who doesn\\'t follow rules is going to get the sweet kid injured with his renegade ways?? why yes! do you think the iraqi kid that cowboy soldier has a soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy? why yes! there is no story here. the script is juvenile and predictable! the camera is shaken around a lot to make it look \"artsy\". and for all of you who think this is such a great war picture, go rent \"full metal jacket\", \"deerhunter\" or \"platoon\". don\\'t waste time or money on this boring movie! a group of friends break down in the middle of nowhere (one had a flat tire, the other\\'s jeep mysteriously won\\'t start). one of them takes the tire to a run down service station and that is the last anyone sees of him. when the remaining foursome go in search of their friend, they come across nice mr. slaussen who offers to help fix the jeep and offers cool drinks and refuge from the heat in his equally run down, hermit-like house, which happens to be occupied by very realistic looking mannequins. he goes with the one guy in the bunch out to work on the car and leaves the 3 girls in the house. before he goes he warns them not to leave and go up to the house behind his shack; he warns them about \"davy\", his brother who is lurking about and isn\\'t all there. of course, one of them decides to venture out in search of a working phone and is never seen again. is it slaussen? is it davy? the mannequins?? tourist trap has the usual horror requirements (jiggly big boobed girl, goody two shoes girl, curiosity getting the better of people and never working out!), but it stands apart from the rest of the 70\\'s genre in it\\'s twist of an ending. i started to feel sorry for slaussen (chuck conners is a terrific, creepy, over-the-top performance)at a point in the film, and you almost see the character of molly doing the same. this is a gem if you can find it; i had taped it off of cable when i was younger, and walking through a used video store i spotted a vhs copy that was totally overpriced, but well worth it. fans of tanya roberts won\\'t be disappointed either. best part of the film for me was the scene with the soup (and crackers!!) i gave it a 7 because some of the movie was and still is hard to explain. most lorne michaels films seem to fail because they\\'re essentially just extended versions of skits that barely managed to make people laugh in five-minute segments. \"tommy boy\" is a character right from \"snl\" - a big fat lovable (in their opinion) goof who doesn\\'t know anything. david spade gets the thankless overwhelmed everyman role. he\\'s paired with the annoying overweight slob and they endure miserable misfortunes as they travel cross country to save daddy\\'s business. the plot, for starters, is really faulty. the whole premise - daddy dies and rich stupid son has to save the family biz - can be traced back to just about any movie you want. like any snl style film it is reduced to a simple motivation - empty, shallow; just a reason to see a fat guy and a thin guy be \"funny\" together. the movie\\'s biggest \"influence\" is the 1987 comedy classic \"planes, trains & automobiles.\" that movie is great because the plot isn\\'t stale and recycled. it\\'s basic, yeah - a guy traveling home for thanksgiving gets stuck with a slob. but it\\'s real, dammit. it makes all the difference. the characters are real, the situations are far more real. \"tommy boy\" is pure slapstick and its ridiculous situations undermine the characters - we feel nothing for them, and we don\\'t care about what\\'s happening on-screen. \"pta\" walked the careful line between outrageous and utterly believable and relate-able - \"tommy boy\" is simply absurd, with jokes like a simple deer-in-the-headlights turning into a crash turning into a struggle with a dead deer that really isn\\'t dead, then awakens and wrecks their car. the whole wrecked car thing is stolen completely from \"pta\" and it\\'s eerie how much stuff in this film actually does resemble the steve martin/john candy movie. farley is simply way too obnoxious to find likable - i\\'ve never enjoyed watching him in any movies and this hasn\\'t changed my mind. spade\\'s given very little to do, serving as the movie\\'s most thankless character. dan aykroyd is wasted as the evil baddie who plans to destroy daddy\\'s business. the ending is a joke, and not in a \"har-har funny\" way. more like a \"oh god are they serious?!\" way. some people dig it, that\\'s cool. but i just can\\'t get into it, nor do i appreciate all the stuff it \"borrows\" from - not just counting \"pt&a\" - without any credit whatsoever. having read during many years about how great this film was, how it established ruiz among the french critics (specially the snobbish cahiers crowd), when i finally watched it about a year ago, i found it pretty disappointing (but then, i guess my expectations were sky-high). shot in saturated black and white, this deliberately cerebral film (made for tv, and mercifully, only an hour long) is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator as they ponder through a series of paintings (which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants) and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime. (the awful kate beckinsale film uncovered has a similar argument). borgesian is a word i read a lot in reviews about this movie, but i would say almost any borges story is more interesting than this film. many teenage sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare, however, every so often a movie might come along thats honest, funny, entertaining and memorable. the last american virgin is a special movie that has found its place and has stood the test of time blending all four ingredients. this film follows three friends (gary, rick and david \"the big apple\") misadventures into the world of first-time sex and true love. along the way they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship. we follow hopeless romantic gary (the main character) on his quest to win over the girl of his dreams which leads him down an uncertain road with a surprise twist at it\\'s ending. if you haven\\'t been lucky enough to see this movie yet, by all means take a look...sprinkled with many memorable 80s songs throughout the movie to keep things moving at an even pace. l.a.v. truly is an original film, a rarity among films of it\\'s genre. i loved this show from it\\'s first airing, and i always looked forward to watching each episode every week. the plot, characters, writing, special affects were outstanding! then the sci-fi channel screwed up yet again and canceled a very entertaining, well written show. i say bring it back, i know all of the actors would come back. i would suggest buying the dvd\\'s, i am. i hope the sci-fi channels executives get word of these comments, and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewers. i only watch one show on that channel now, (ghost hunters), but i am fairly sure that shortly they will cancel that too. i didn\\'t know what to except so i think it was a lot better not having excepted much. don\\'t get my wrong its not a bad short film. tess nanavati is a relatively new directer and writer so i think she deserves a lot of kudos for making this film. you can tell that it has been an act of love for her. the acting (outside of dominic) is a little cheesy and the quality of film is not great either but for a really low budget film its good. there was times when the story line gets convoluted and there are parts that drag on, though i don\\'t feel it greatly detracts for one\\'s ability to understand the film. if you love dominic monaghan as much as i do, i say go for it. the gag reel was fun, i won\\'t spoil it but there is a particular scene that makes buying the dvd worth it just so you can watch it over and over. if you like the film then check out the pink mirror, a film also done by jagged edge. i know fans of dominic will enjoy this little piece of heaven. did the first travesty actually make money? this is another sequel (along the lines of another stakeout) that no one asked for. but we\\'ve received it anyway. the sequel is like its predecessor, completely brain-dead. it\\'s also pretty disgusting (remember the dinner scene?) to think i almost felt sorry for ritter, yasbeck, and warden. did they need the money that much? i was never so bored in my life. hours of pretentious, self-obsessed heroin-addicted basket cases lounging around whining about their problems. it\\'s like watching lizards molt. even the sex scenes will induce a serious case of narcolepsy. if you have insomnia, rent this. this movie is awesome on so many levels... and none of them are the level that it was intended to be awesome on. just remember this: when you\\'re watching shaun of the dead and other recent zombie movies... be they good or bad... this is the formula that they are using. this is what makes zombie movies so great. and what makes it better than great is the story behind the movie. a simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know. all in all, it doesn\\'t linger. there\\'s never a point where you think to yourself \"c\\'mon, get on with it\"... it moves quick and corners nicely. this is the sporty, little italian number of zombie flicks. so awful, it\\'s wonderful! if your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek... rent it, buy it, love it. as a great trivia note: if you\\'re watching it on dvd, you\\'ll notice that there is sound effects during the menu screen, underneath the musical score... well... that\\'s because that music was lifted straight from the trailer... which is probably the only working print of that music that still exists which is long enough to loop. the ladies man is laugh out loud funny, with a great diverse cast as well as having some very stupid but excellent scenes (including the funniest love song ever written). ferrell is his usual quality self in a brilliant side role. tim meadows plays an idiot surprisingly well and has written himself some of the funniest lines you\\'ll find in any comedy out there. it is definitely worth a purchase as watching it every 6 months or so will lead to you still laughing as hard as you did first time round. i am distraught to think at the time of writing this that it has a meagre 4.7 /10 and i urge you to vote! and remember kids- \"theres more motion in the ocean\" when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like the duchess(2008), but when i saw the first 30 minutes of the young victoria i knew this wouldn\\'t just be a solid movie. almost everything in this movie is great, the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shot. the only thing that really let me down are the performances. emily blunt(the devil wears prada) is the star of the film, bringing victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first oscar nomination for her performance. rupert friend is almost bland as prince albert but he has great chemistry with emily blunt. paul bettany is also solid as lord melbourne although i expected more of him. jim broadbent and miranda richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettable. to me the film feels like unfinished. maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script, i don\\'t know but that\\'s how i feel about the movie. but overall it\\'s a great movie about the early years of victoria with a great performance from emily blunt. a flying saucer manned (literally) by a crew of about 20 male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from earth to check in on a colony founded some 25 years ago on a \\'forbidden planet.\\' what they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth, a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman, and her father, a hermit philologist haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization he has immersed himself in. on the surface, this story is a pulp scifi murder mystery. some compare it to shakespeare\\'s tempest, but this is a stretch, and, in some ways, an insult to the scifi genre. stripped of what makes it a scifi film, sure, its the tempest, but how many hundreds of films can you say something similar about? underneath, this is a cautionary tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for its appropriate and safe use. yet the film still proceeds with all the hopefulness for our future that we have come to expect from shows like star trek. anne francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful. the special effects, and even the aesthetics of the backdrops are powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven acting almost unnoticeable. if it were not for the goofy retro-art-deco-ness of 1950s sci-fi props, you might think you were watching a 1960s piece. this is a classic of that very special sub-genre of sci fi i like to call 1950s sci-fi, and, though not, in my opinion, the best it is certainly a must see for anybody interested in sci-fi film and special effects. the clever plot, now rendered trite by its reuse in six or seven episodes of star trek, lost in space, and even farscape, is worth paying attention to, and will sustain the interest of most scifi fans. trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film which seem to have inspired themes of star trek\\'s original series aired about 12 years later, though they may find themselves disappointed by the (relatively mild) 1950s sexism and the lack of any kind of racial integration. while i do not mean to nitpick, the lack of social progress manifest in this film was the one major problem i had with it. some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young, good-looking leslie nielsen in one of his first starring roles. unfortunately, nielsen\\'s performance is only average, and at times down-right poor (especially at the climax of the film). walter pigeon, though quite excellent in other films, over-acts his role as well. ms francis, earl holliman, and the amazing robby the robot are the stand-out actors in this crowd, though on the whole the character actors filling in the ensemble do a good job. the problems with the featured performances, i think, are as much the fault of the director and the editor, as anything. though they certainly got most of the film quite right. i just saw this film on dvd last night, and decided to check out the reviews this morning. it seems that \"i, robot\" has polarized the critical viewing community here on imdb (and given rise to a lot of insults and name-calling, too). i find this somewhat surprising, as this film is not great (or even good), but neither is it terrible (or even really bad). what this film really is, is...depressing. depressing that the us film-goer population is so ready to lap up insipid, clichã©d re-heats, and acclaim them as spectacular new works. this film as \"retread\" written all over it, from the plot line (an uneasy mix of asimov and modern-day uber-action) to smith\\'s character (a smart-mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium), to the special effects (that borrowed from matrix and a few others). \"i, robot\" is, sadly, quite possibly the perfect action movie for today\\'s audience: superficial plot, insipidly snappy dialog, and lots and lots of adrenaline. smith is mediocre, but we already knew that (he seems to be hollywood\\'s latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black bruce willis). the story has lots of holes in it, of all sizes, but i don\\'t think most people drawn to this film are critically-minded enough to notice. perhaps a blockbuster by today\\'s standards, but very b-movie compared to true winners. this was a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and big effects. just tell a true story about the struggles of two african american women over a turbulent century. this movie challenges us all to look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are people, not white, black, etc. good movie with a good message. i have bought the complete season of surface. watched it in 3 days! i was so captured by the the plot, theories and basically everything about this show. the actor who plays miles is great. mile\\'s sister, mother and father acted like real life family would. you could connect on so many levels it\\'s fascinating. i find animals are so wonderful, you can almost connect with them as a parent is to a child. it would be something if a creature of this sort of nature truly exists. am sadden, that surface is not having a second season or at least four more shows. i have so many questions that need to be answered and hopefully maybe they will create more or maybe in a book. love the show very much. for those who haven\\'t watched surface, if you like sci-fi you need to watch this!!!!!!!!!!!!! this must have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i have to disagree with another commenter, who said the special effects were okay. i found them pretty bad: it just wasn\\'t realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story. maybe that distraction is the reason that i did not fully understand the story. the archaeologists are looking for \"the set\". they do not bother to tell what set, or what is so special about it. that also makes it unclear why they search for it in california, while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient egypt. if you\\'re shooting a movie that takes place in the desert, take the effort to actually go to the desert. the beginning - the ancient ceremony - looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desert. the action-level was constant throughout the movie, no ups and downs, no climax. it made the movie look short, and that\\'s certainly a pro for this particular movie. liam neeson portrays the scottish legend robert roy macgregor from the early 18th century. he is a true actor. he captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles. jessica lange is excellent as his wife mary. mary is such a beautiful woman. it\\'s her love that makes rob roy the legend, but it\\'s his passion that makes her love undying. they need each other. tim roth as the evil cunningham is perfect; in one way or another, upon watching the movie, you will find cunningham disgusting. the scotland scenery is beautiful. the environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well. if you like history, romance, passion and love, you\\'ll enjoy rob roy. there is violence and blood, but it\\'s unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told; no gratuitous violence. and you do have to listen carefully if you\\'re not used to a scottish accent. one important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized; they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes. it\\'s their skill as actors that attracts you, they don\\'t rely on marquee names, popularity or sex symbol appeal. this is something special. when i watch this movie i too get excited when seen bed scenes of miss world. she has beautiful and charming body. when cute lady do bed scenes and show her fully nude body... i think male have hard to resist....i think its time for cute girls like hrishita bhatt also do nude scenes. at least no one wants to c nude body of ugly women like seema biswas to c in bandit queen.i concur with what mallicka.b has said. the movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content. emotions aren\\'t conveyed properly. i guess a couple of not-so-good performances also contributed to its mediocrity. in my view, tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of aishwarya rai. in some of her scenes, she looks a bit lusty, which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed. i also noticed a bit of over-acting in some of her scenes. i\\'m a bitter critic of aishwarya rai :) can\\'t help it; sorry for that. \\'raincoat\\' was a good movie by rituparno ghosh. and i saw choker bali after seeing raincoat; i was not at all impressed they\\'ve shown i twice in a very short time now here in sweden and i am so very tired of it. the bad acting isn\\'t enough... the story itself is so boring and the effects hardly exists. i love the original from 1953 so i recommend you to go and rent that one instead. because this one is such a bore. having seen carlo lizzani\\'s documentary on luchino visconti, i was bound to higher expectations before watching this film made three years later by adam low. but the viewer like me did get dissatisfied... i faced a need for critical opinion, which i generally don\\'t like giving due to the fact there are no documentaries that will satisfy every viewer. there are also no documentaries that will examine a theme totally. but when i read the reviews already written on this title, i also felt a bit confused. people sometimes don\\'t know what to criticize. therefore, to be clear, i\\'ll divide this film into two major parts that differ considerably: the former one about visconti before his director\\'s career and latter one about visconti the director. the aristocratic background, all the hobbies, the wealth that young luchino experienced and enjoyed are clearly presented. his effort in horse racing is mentioned as well as his relation with his mother so much disturbed after his parents\\' divorce. we also get a very accurate idea of where luchino was brought up as a real count of milano: in riches galore, with nannies, cooks with access to everything, in true aristocracy. for instance, his father\\'s splendid villa at grazzano and other marvelous villas prove that. there is also an emphasis on visconti\\'s crucial visit in paris in the 1930s where he met eminent people (\"left wingers\") who later had impact on his style and message in art. that clearly explains the idea of a communist with the aristocratic upbringing (a contrast at first sight). however, the part about his director\\'s career, which started with ossessione during wwii and ended with innocente just before the director\\'s death in 1976, is poorly executed. his movies are not discussed well. why? because there are very few people who really have something to say. franco zeffirelli, the director, remembers the works on la terra trema and that is all right. there are also some interviews with franco rosi. but later, such movies like il gattopardo, la caduta dei rei, la morte a venezia or ludwig are mostly discussed by helmut berger. although i liked the actor in the role of ludwig, i did not like the interviews of his. moreover, some thoughts he reveals are not accurate to entail in such a documentary... there is no mention of significant works of visconti like conversation piece, there are no interviews with eminent cast burt lancaster. a mention about silvana mangano and romy schneider should also be made. there is one footage interview with maria callas that appears to be interesting but that is only a short bit. franco zeffirelli, though i appreciate him as a director, makes fun of it all rather than says something really precious. for instance, he mentions the event how visconti separated from him after years of service. therefore, i say: simplified and unsatisfactory. what i find a strong point here are footage interviews with visconti himself. as a result, we may get his own opinion about his works. for instance, i very much appreciate the words he says about death regarding it as a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself. he also discusses his health problems after the stroke while filming ludwig. i believe it is better to see luchino visconti (1999) by carlo lizzani than this doc. although it is shorter and condensed as a whole, you will get a better idea of the director. visconti would be furious about that and the fury of his usually turned people\\'s emotions and viewpoints into stone... 4/10 time is precious. this film isn\\'t. i must learn to ignore critics who rave about small films like fargo and this complete waste of time. the theater was packed and everyone left with the same reaction: is this the film the critics are raving about? what a piece of crap! the hook of this film is the upwardly mobile black daughter seeking out and finding her white trash family. get it? the acting is superb. the production (lighting, sets, editing, sound) is about 2 steps above a 60 minutes story. the characters are shallow and unintelligent. i was insulted by the fact that these people could not figure out about each other what was blatantly obvious to the audience; the audience was murmuring to the movie screen what the characters should say next. i have had more fun doing the laundry. worst. movie. ever made. ever. i have no words to say about it.. other then it truly had no point, no plot, no... anything. sheer crap!!! i don\\'t know how everyone in the movie didn\\'t shoot them shelves after watching it.... .... .... ... .. i love vampire flicks and mysteries, and alternate abstract outside the box films, and.... this was non of those. i mean what the crap!!! i cant even tell you what the film was about cuz i still don\\'t know, and i just wasted an hour and ahalf of my life watching it... bottom line.. i think the maker of this film just wants everyone to do drugs. thats the only thing i got from this film. please don\\'t watch this... i mean for a \" sultry sensual vampire flick\" there wasn\\'t even the to be expected nudity you\\'d get from a vamp flick. anyway back to my point.... this movie blows. go set yourself on fire instead.... .. .. savage island (2003) is a lame movie. it\\'s more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting. not only that the storyline and script was wretched. i don\\'t know why this movie was made. i have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones i really hate are movies that make me angry. this one made my blood boil. the situations were inane at best. if i made a movie like this it would have been a short. really because those backwood \"idjits\" wouldn\\'t have been in the picture. don\\'t be fooled by the cover on the d.v.d. i am an avid watcher of bad cinema. but this movie is virtually unwatchable. i don\\'t mind movies being shot on d.v. but if you\\'re going to do that make the movie enjoyable, not some tired retread of superior horror films (sans wrong turn). i have to not recommend this waste of disk. if you come across this one in the rental store pass on by. movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic 1. i have to say this is my favorite movie of all time. i have seen it well over 100 times (actually had to buy a new copy as a result of overwatching) it is what the eighties was like and what a romantic story with a few morals thrown in. i highly recommend to anyone wanting to relive the high schools days again. buy a copy now it is a classic!!!! i saw it at the legacy theater in the joseph smith memorial building in salt lake city this morning. i\\'m going to assume that one\\'s level of enjoyment during this movie will largely be based on one\\'s level of acceptance of joseph\\'s story. however, that aside it was very well made, well acted, and had a nice score. if you get to salt lake city, it is a must to see it in the legacy theater. i have never been in a nicer theater as far as picture quality, sound quality and ambiance in my entire life...i wonder if the church would let me watch batman begins there! being that i\\'m lds and regard joseph as a prophet, i was touched in several places and was brought to tears quite a few times...which i presume is expected since they handed out tissues before the movie started! anyway, i\\'m told that this film is available in several lds visitor centers around the globe, if you have 70 minutes check it out because whether you believe joseph smith or not, he tells a fascinating story. adenoid hynkel, a lowly soldier in world war one, rises in subsequent years to become the ruthless dictator of toumania. he creates an aggressive, antisemitic war machine and cultivates a little toothbrush moustache. sound like anyone you know? from the safety of hollywood, chaplin uses this soapbox to exhort europe to take up arms and defy hitler and mussolini. given that the united states in 1940 had more than a year of neutrality ahead of it, and no strong desire to embroil itself in europe\\'s civil strife (remember, it was hitler who declared war on the usa, not the other way round) it is surprising that chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate polemic. the story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and repellant hynkel and the reign of terror over which he ineptly presides, and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly, humane, brave, etc., etc, chaplin is hynkel, and he also plays the jewish barber, the little hero of the ghetto (the tramp in all but name). needless to say, chaplin writes, directs, stars, composes the music and does the catering. in 1940 the full truth was not yet known about the third reich, and chaplin can be forgiven for having something less than perfect historical foresight, but even by the standards of the day he gets hitler badly wrong. a comedian and a sentimentalist, chaplin tries to ridicule hitler by making hynkel silly and hapless. all this does is to humanise him. when hynkel the not-very-warlike soldier fools around with the big gun and the upside-down aeroplane, he becomes endearing rather than despicable. as dictator, he inspects his subordinates\\' technical innovations which don\\'t work (the parachute hat, the bulletproof uniform etc.) and these passages are meant to make us think that the real-life nazis are incompetent and can be swept aside. in fact, hynkel\\'s regime is made cute and likeable by its bumbling bodgery. in truth, chaplin\\'s day had already passed when he made this ill-considered polemic. at heart, he was still a dinosaur of the silent screen (check out the humour, with gags like staggering up and down the street semi-conscious, or the pantomime of the coins in the puddings). the hero schultz is meant to represent a yardstick of european decency against which hynkel can be judged, but schultz looks more like a character from operetta than a nazi. is it in any way believable that a schultz figure (if such had existed) would say to the fuehrer\\'s face, \"your cause is doomed to failure because it\\'s built upon the stupid, ruthless persecution of innocent people\"? and how does schultz come to be in the cellars of the jewish ghetto? if he is the object of an exhaustive manhunt, why does he persist in wearing his ruritanian uniform? chaplin did not yet know the full horrors of auschwitz-birkenau or treblinka, but the nazi concentration camp which he offers us is hopelessly out of kilter with the grim spirit of the age. as usual, chaplin thinks in terms of \\'silent\\' comedy set-pieces, loosely pegged onto the narrative clothes line. there is the knockabout scrapping with the stormtroopers, shaving a man to the accompaniment of brahms, and the globe ballet (watch for the segment filmed in reverse). paulette goddard is the unremittingly perfect hannah. just as the people of the ghetto are impossibly nice, and the jewish haven in osterlich is ridiculously idyllic, so hannah is quite literally too good to be true. brave, defiant, resourceful, hardworking and (of course) beautiful, she is the canary of judaism in the ghetto cage. \"gee, ain\\'t i cute?\" she asks, after the barber gives her a make-over. too cute by far, is the answer. she doesn\\'t come close to ringing true, because chaplin has made her a caricature. the \\'wouldn\\'t it be wonderful?\\' speech which chaplin puts into her mouth is typical of the author - too wordy, too emotionally cloying. jack oakie is great as napaloni, the fascist dictator of bacteria. he brings a whiff of much-needed comic brio to the proceedings, but the film\\'s underlying weakness remains. if napaloni is silly and ineffective, how can we fear him? and anyway, the stuttering stop-start of the back-projected train is a fine chaplinesque example of a gag that is persisted with far beyond its comic worth. and where did the jewish barber acquire that immaculate hynkel uniform? \"milo\" is yet another answer to a question nobody ever asked.do we really need more slashers?i for one think we already have more than enough.i guess the professional tall guys overcharged so in this one we deal with a murderous kid that\\'s also a zombie or a ghost when he feels like it.a long time ago,he drowned but that didn\\'t bother him and he still kills people(\"friday the 13th\",what\\'s that?).one day,his survivors have a big reunion and as a surprise twist,milo comes to pay them a visit.through some really bad shots that show everything except the murders the cast is thinned out till only the final girl is left to find out milo\\'s dull,i mean dark secret.she and her friends have been dying to know.once discovered,milo goes on yet another murderous rampage(isn\\'t it his bedtime yet?) and the girl,well she screams a lot.the acting is not even bottom of the barrel,the barrel refuses to be associated with it.milo can be one creepy bastard from time to time i give him that,but some movies just can\\'t be saved without a great script or gratuitous nudity. this is one of the best horror / suspense films that hollywood has made in years or maybe even decades.even though in my opinion this movie was predictable in parts, it has everything that a good film in this genre should had chill, thrills, and yes a lot of gore!! house of wax sure delivers!!! in parts it was sort of far-fetched,the acting was not that great,but my overhaul rating for house of wax is an eight out of ten......if you enjoy being at the edge of your seats, this is just the right movie for you,i have to admit,it was sort of neat seeing the whole town made out of wax...... i myself enjoy these museums, but after seeing this film i will now look at them in a whole new different way! never saw the original movie in the series...i only hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the 1980\\'s as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified. this movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now. anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie. it was, however, a movie that would make some walt disney movies look dark. really, this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen. the only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm, other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as a kid. the story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random boats through the water. not really worth watching i would however like to see the original, granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the 80\\'s, but he also made a very good slasher movie in the 70\\'s \"the town the dreaded sundown\". created in 1928, and originally named mortimer before walt disney changed his name (because his wife convinced him), mickey mouse has become the staple of the disney brand. i always thought this cartoon was the first ever cartoon to feature mickey, it is in fact his third, but it doesn\\'t matter, for a six minute animated short it is enjoyable. the story sees mickey piloting a steamboat until captain pete takes him off the bridge, stopping to pick up cargo, and minnie mouse missing the boat. being lifted on she drops her music sheets and a goat eats them, mickey helps her crank it\\'s tail and play the tune, and getting some other animals to be percussion, until pete comes along again to stop him, making mickey peel potatoes. mickey mouse was number 53 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons, and he was number 31 on the 100 greatest cartoons. very good! highly regarded at release, but since rather neglected. immense importance in the history of performing arts. a classic use of embedded plots. one of my favourite films. why hasn\\'t the soundtrack been re-released? the perfect murder is foiled when a wife(played by mary ellen trainor, once the wife to director robert zemeckis, who helmed this episode), who murders her husband with a poker, has the misfortune of receiving a visitor as she is about to move the body outside..an escaped insane madman dressed in a santa claus suit(played by a deviously hideous larry drake). she fends for her life while trying to find a way of hiding her husband\\'s corpse. she decides to use an ax, once she downs the santa killer who misses several chances to chop off the woman\\'s head, to frame the killer for her husband\\'s murder. santa killer locks her in a closet and pursues the woman\\'s daughter as she tries desperate to free herself to save the child. this episode of tales from the crypt just recycles tired material involving the old \"santa kills\" theme while also adding the oft-used(add nauseum)woman-murders-her-husband-for-a-man-she\\'s-been-cheating-with routine. it\\'s essentially trainor trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body she kills while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac. there\\'s nothing refreshing or new about this plot which pretty much goes through the motions. not one of the show\\'s highlights. the imdb plot summary in no way describes the essence of this film. it should have read \\'be prepared to be catapulted back to the prison of the 3rd pew from the back of your family\\'s church at 8 years old, listening to the preacher drone on about god\\'s will while all you can think of is getting back home to your lego\\'. it starts off well intentioned, building intrigue by planting some real and surreal clues such as renny\\'s \\'how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast?\\' moment. it then slowly morphs into a christian jamboree, sacrificing its plot completely in a wash of evangelistic-induced babble. i believe i counted the use of the word \\'pray\\' about 53 times in a five minute span near the end. after the 31st, i tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym, \\'prey\\'. sadly, this little mind game of mine made the film at least bearable for the last 20 minutes. plus it made me laugh whenever a character would say \\'prayer\\' (\\'preyer\\' to me) as it became totally zany. indeed, even my catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom, almost to the point of ending up on the floor. for all the salivating christians who ranked this film 8-10 stars, i suggest sticking with your theology-reinforcing safety standards like circle square, the ten commandments, anything from narnia, jesus christ superstar and the like. stay away from more cerebrally challenging subject matter in films such as jesus camp, the god who wasn\\'t there, what would jesus buy, or the soon-to-be released religulous. maybe robert whitlow\\'s book is better. tess of the storm country is possibly the best movie of all of mary pickford\\'s films. at two hours, it was quite long for a 1922 silent film yet continues to hold your interest some 80 years after it was filmed. mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like a \"greatest hits\" performance with bits of mary the innocent, mary the little devil, mary the little mother, mary the spitfire, mary the romantic heroine, etc. characteristics that often were used throughout a single film in the past. the movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting character\\'s illegitimate child for 1922 and at one point our little mary is thought the unwed mother in question! if the academy awards had been around in 1922, no doubt the best actress oscar for the year would have been mary\\'s. i first saw this movie when i was about 10 years old. my mom bought it at our local kmart because it was on sale for $5 on vhs. she thought that it would be a nice christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch. this movie, however, scared the hell out of me. you may be asking yourself, how could a movie about santa clause scare anyone? the plot of the movie revolves around satan sending one his minions, pitch, to earth in an attempt to kill santa and ruin christmas. that\\'s right, satan sends a demon up from hell to kill santa clause. pitch stalks santa throughout christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on christmas day, for if santa doesn\\'t make it back to his home in space, he turns to powder. don\\'t get me wrong, the movie is funny and fairly entertaining, however, the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell (which occurs at the beginning of the movie) is just downright creepy. although there are some snippets in this 4-part documentary hinting at the necessity for recreational drug law reform, these are not very well-developed, in contrast to the many snippets from those who feel that the drugs that happen to currently be illegal are a scourge for which the only imaginable solution is incarceration of even those who are guilty even of mere possession of such drugs. although this program, as a whole, leaves the viewer with the impression that the drug war is largely a futile exercise and a waste of money, and for that it deserves some praise, almost nothing in this documentary addresses the very real problems that total war against those who merely possess illegal drugs obviously causes and contributes to--very real problems that most drug warriors themselves would tell you, if asked, they think the drug war is designed to solve. for example, while many minutes are spent on the surge in violence associated with the rising popularity of crack cocaine in the 80\\'s, at no point does this program even hint that the very laws designed to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug sellers to enforce their contracts and business arrangements in courts of law, forcing them to resort to violence to stay in business. but instead of seeing the laws as an important cause of the violence, the drugs themselves seem to take the brunt of the blame. inexplicably, alcohol prohibition, the violence that ensued, and the subsequent reversal of prohibition, is totally ignored by this program. this program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotypes of drug users, and it is these that are the primary force in driving the very expensive and very problematic drug war. the possibility of incorporating drugs other than alcohol into a happy and successful life is not really touched on. use of any drug in excess is probably going to cause personal problems, but not all users do their drugs in excess, just like not all alcohol users are alcoholics. if you want a point of view from someone who believes that adults have a moral right not to be incarcerated and have their lives ruined by the criminal justice system just for using drugs that the government, for mostly very arbitrary political reasons rather than reasons based on sound social policy and legitimate science, has decided to totally prohibit, whose users it has decided to not-so-metaphorically wage war against, just forget about it. none of that is in here. on the other hand, this is hardly in the category of anti-drug propaganda. it is mostly an interesting neutrally-presented history of drugs in 20th century united states like marijuana, lsd, heroin, cocaine, mdma, and oxycontin. but there is a significant element of various people\\'s points of view with regard to drug laws, and most (but not all) of that is not very thoughtful or well-informed and slanted in favor of the drug warrior mentality, especially with respect to drugs other than marijuana. the criminal justice system, along with its often harsh life-ruining penalties, is obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem, but unfortunately there\\'s an epidemic in this nation of an as-yet unnamed disease whose primary symptoms are a lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it comes to certain drugs, a lack of compassion for fellow humans, a prejudice against people who use the drugs that are not governmentally-approved, perhaps a vested interest in the growth of the prison/policing industry, and a horrid apathy with regard to human dignity. it\\'s morally wrong to kidnap or incarcerate people unless you have a very damn good reason for doing so, and the mere possession of an arbitrarily selected group of drugs is clearly not such a reason. this is really the primary issue when it comes to drugs, yet this program ignores it. so, in sum, the parts of this program that neutrally present history without feeding stereotypes of drug users that are at the heart of the drug war mentality are pretty good and interesting and entertaining. but when it comes to presenting a rational non-radical point of view with regard to drug policy, and giving the viewer examples not only of people with drug problems but also the many people who successfully incorporate drugs into happy and successful lives, it\\'s pretty disappointing. considering this film was released 8 years before i was born, i don\\'t feel too bad for over-looking it for such a long time. back in january of 98 though, i attended the second annual quentin tarantino film fest held in austin,texas. the particular theme of films this night was \"neglected 70\\'s crime films\" and boy was her right. \"the gravy train(or the dion brothers, as it appeared this print)\" was an absolute gem. wonderful performances, quirky characters, smart plot, hilarious comedy, and just an all around great time. rarely do you see a crime film that is so entertaining and fresh. margot kidder in one of her earliest film appearances is extremely sexy as well. i hope some cable network gets a hold of this film and allows many more to see it. in the meantime, go to an indie video store and hope they have it. the movie was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who had desires to become a famous girl group. in their endeavors, the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler called satin, whom sister goes after because she believes he is the \"big time\" who will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life. though he could be accused of killing her, he really kills only her spirit and will to live, after which she becomes a drug addict and ultimately dies from an overdose. the story isn\\'t about the street life or the italian mobster who tries to buy stix off, then threatens him, it\\'s about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life as portrayed in song and style and the character that was the life in the times for young women trying to be \"discovered\" back then. first, i realize that a \"1\" rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst. this movie gets that from me because, as one reviewer points out, it\\'s not bad in a self-aware, over-the-top sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult value. it simply misses its mark on every count. **contains possible spoilers** the dialog is completely disingenuous. the continuity is so deliberate it\\'s painful. daniel just finishes speaking of his lost love, and with his final word the flamenco dancers start. the mock-shock of what\\'s her name (see? i don\\'t even remember her character\\'s name, let alone the name of the forgettable actress) when her husband (the baldwin) first tells her that her friend is the bad guy. the car and the motorcycle chases did all the right things. vegetable carts gone flying. cars crashing into each other. motorcycles going down the stairs. people nearly being hit, but remarkably, no one is. oh, that\\'s right... except for the one guy who has been stabbed several times, is obviously stumbling along the curb with knife wounds, and an approaching car apparently didn\\'t notice him there. hmmm. it\\'s becoming more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can be made. there is so much pressure in the film industry to make money, you\\'d think that someone in hollywood would think of making good films worth seeing. now there\\'s a novel idea. my suggestion: don\\'t see this film. don\\'t rent the dvd. don\\'t watch it on cable. there are lots of other things you could be doing that will leave you feeling more satisfied. picture the scene where a bunch of scriptwriters sit around a table and one says \"lets have a black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public (also black) in the street and ask him if he is black, then walk away\". the other writers fall about laughing hysterically until one suggests they repeat it in every episode. more laughter. now if you think the premise is funny, and the show contains many such types of situation, you will enjoy this show. for the rest, use your zapper and find something more entertaining like watching paint dry. those that have written glowing reports of this show should either get out more or be forced to watch television comedies that are really funny. another example of the humor in the show, a girl tries to get out of paying at a supermarket checkout by trying to hypnotise the cashier. marginally funny the first time but why repeat it over and over in different shows with different cashiers? i could give other examples but these just might be treated as spoilers, divulging why this comedy just is not funny at all. the year 2005 saw no fewer than 3 filmed productions of h. g. wells\\' great novel, \"war of the worlds\". this is perhaps the least well-known and very probably the best of them. no other version of wotw has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as wells wrote it, but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place: the last year of the 19th century, 1900 â… using wells\\' original setting, in and near woking, england. imdb seems unfriendly to what they regard as \"spoilers\". that might apply with some films, where the ending might actually be a surprise, but with regard to one of the most famous novels in the world, it seems positively silly. i have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the seminal works in english literature, so let\\'s get right to the chase. the aliens are destroyed through catching an earth disease, against which they have no immunity. if that\\'s a spoiler, so be it; after a book and 3 other films (including the 1953 classic), you ought to know how this ends. this film, which follows wells\\' plot in the main, is also very cleverly presented â– in a way that might put many viewers off due to their ignorance of late 19th/early 20th century photography. although filmed in a widescreen aspect, the film goes to some lengths to give an impression of contemporaneity. the general coloration of skin and clothes display a sepia tint often found in old photographs (rather than black). colors are often reminiscent of hand-tinting. at other times, colors are washed out. these variations are typical of early films, which didn\\'t use standardized celluloid stock and therefore presented a good many changes in print quality, even going from black/white to sepia/white to blue/white to reddish/white and so on â– as you\\'ll see on occasion here. the special effects are deliberately retrograde, of a sort seen even as late as the 1920s â– and yet the martians and their machines are very much as wells described them and have a more nearly realistic \"feel\". some of effects are really awkward â– such as the destruction of big ben. the acting is often more in the style of that period than ours. some aspects of victorian dress may appear odd, particularly the use of pomade or brilliantine on head and facial hair. this film is the only one that follows with some closeness wells\\' original narrative â– as has been noted. viewers may find it informative to note plot details that appear here that are occasionally retained in other versions of the story. wells\\' description of the martians â– a giant head mounted on numerous tentacles â– is effectively portrayed. when the martian machines appear, about an hour into the film, they too give a good impression of how wells described them. both wells and this film do an excellent job of portraying the progress of the martians from the limited perspective (primarily) of rural england â– plus a few scenes in london (involving the narrator\\'s brother). the director is unable to resist showing the destruction of a major landmark (big ben), but at least doesn\\'t dwell unduly on the devastation of london. the victory of the martians is hardly a surprise, despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machines. the narrator, traveling about to seek escape, sees much of what wells terms \"the rout of mankind\". he encounters a curate endowed with the victorian affliction of a much too precious and nervous personality. they eventually find themselves on the very edge of a martian nest, where they discover an awful fact: the martians are shown to be vampires who consume their prey alive in a very effective scene. wells adds that after eating they set up \"a prolonged and cheerful hooting\". the narrator finally is obliged to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical curate â– who revives just as the martians drag him off to the larder (cheers from the gallery; british curates are so often utterly insufferable). this film lasts almost 3 hours, going through wells\\' story in welcome detail. it\\'s about time the author got his due â– in a compelling presentation that builds in dramatic impact. a word about the acting: don\\'t expect award-winning performances. they\\'re not bad, however, the actors are earnest and they grow on you. most of them, however, have had very abbreviated film careers, often only in this film. the narrator is played by hunky anthony piana, in his 2nd film. the curate is john kaufman â– also in his 2nd film as an actor but who has had more experience directing. the brother (\"henderson\") is played with some conviction by w. bernard bauman in his first film. the artilleryman, the only other sizable part, is played by james lathrop in his first film. this is overall a splendid film, portraying for the first time the war of the worlds as wells wrote it. despite its slight defects, it is far and away better than any of its hyped-up competitors. if you want to see h. g. wells\\' war of the worlds â– and not some wholly distorted version of it â– see this film! of the elements that make this the best at this point, i have to say #1 is christine mcintire. shemp\\'s scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent. i imagine that, as one poster suggested, christine was trying to hold back laughter during that scene, but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil, to be smiling at shemp\\'s possibly dying. another character who helps this stand out is the goon. his look was a great cross between horrific and comedic goof-ball. hardly a character i would choose to meet in a dark alley or, for that matter anywhere. i would have preferred a bit of true whodunit mystery in this, but hey, when a short is this good, who\\'s going to complain. not i. okay this is stupid,they say their not making another nightmare film,that this is the \"last\" one...and what do they do?they go on making another one,not that the next one (part7) was bad,but why do they play us. anyway this movie made no sense what-so ever,it was extremelly dull,the characters were highly one dimensional,freddy was another joker,which is very stupid for such a good series.the plot is very,very bad,and this is even worse than part 2 and 5. i didnt get the movie,its a stupid tale in 3-d,pointless!id say. i hated this film so much i still rmember all the parts i didnt like which was basically the whole film.this is so different than the prequels,it tries,and tries,but this one tried the hardest,and got slapped back on the face.again there were hadly any death scenes,although they were different,they sucked bigtime. how can they have gone this far?didnt they see they made the biggest mistakes at parts 2 and 5?yet they make this?its all bout the money,do not see this sad excuse for a nightmare series. i gave a nightmare on elm street six (6) 3 out of 10. good points of movie: had potential with plot. bad points of film: terrible acting/lack of deaths/too funny to be classified as horror/very confusing. everyone, my name may sound weird, but there was nothing else! any way, i haven\\'t seen anything like this before so it was crazy! of course that\\'s a good thing. it is a humorously interesting movie and my absolute all time favourite thing is how they intertwine other things into one! like chicken little,, the fish pretending to be king kong and runt the pig saying, \"twas beauty who killed the beast\", war of the worlds scene and more. walt disney company has not lost his touch maybe not for this one. also, how they made it like they were watching a movie and it was like a home cinema. however some parts don\\'t fit. like in the original lion king, weren\\'t timon and pumbaa with simba when he beat scar? in this movie, they are not! they were fighting the hyenas backstage. ther\\'s more, the reason being why pumbaa isn\\'t so confident is because he was pushed away by the other animals and also, it\\'s just timon, timon, timon. anybody realise that only timonn\\'s story was told, whereas pumbaa only had flashbacks? but apart from that , it\"s great! finally was there released a good modesty blaise movie, which not only tells a story, but actually tells the \"real\" story. i admit that it is a bad movie if you expect an action thriller, but if you stop in your track and remove all your expectations. then you will notice that it is a story that comes very close to the original made by peter o\\'donnell. you have a cover story just to tell about how modesty became the magnificent person which she is. it is not a movie to attract new fans, but a movie to tell the real tale. some things could have been better, but when you cannot forget the awful movie from \\'66 then is this a magnificent movie. so are you a fan then sit down relax and just enjoy that the real story is there with a cover story just to make modesty tell her story. by now, the game\\'s stale, right? the jokes have been done. its all over. the creative genius which drove this game for the first two games was gone, after all. wrong. the game is still intact, the jokes are here, folks. sure, they\\'re all rehash, but so was monkey island 2. and 1, for that matter. the difficulty is well placed, somewhere between the slightly easy 1 and the ridiculously hard 2. the ship fighting sub-game is badly innappropriate, in the tradition of sub-games. and this game has the best joke of the whole series. when asked for your membership card to an exclusive beach, always select \"you don\\'t need to see my identification.\" its worth the price of the game by itself. i decided to watch this movie because i\\'d not seen carol lombard before in any movie. i\\'m sorry it had to be this one because, quite frankly, this is a dog â– and even with jimmy stewart and charles coburn, both of whom were great actors. the problem with the film is simple: it tries to put too much, too quickly, in to a story about a young lawyer (john manson played by stewart) who marries jane (played by lombard) within an hour of meeting her. what\\'s that clichã©? marry in haste, repent at leisure... in short, the story is a series of episodes that show the couples\\' worsening financial status, their troubles with john\\'s live-in mother, their struggles to pay the bills, john\\'s diminished status at the office, the arrival of their baby son, john jnr (unexpected and causing additional friction at home with mother), the couples\\' angst about their marriage, the baby\\'s sickness which worsens, thus necessitating an heroic flight by a lone pilot (in a fierce storm) to bring a special serum to save the child, and finally john being accepted as a junior partner at the law firm. how many more clichã©d situations could the writers include? maybe mother dying soon after? there wasn\\'t much comedy; the drama was lacklustre, at best; the dialog was painful to hear. only the acting of the four main players was adequate. this was the period at the end of the great depression with the usa coming out of its long downturn â– during which many people experienced all of the events portrayed in the movie. so, it made sense for selznick to reaffirm good ol\\' home spun american values of family, relationships, heroism, perseverance, and initiative â– all against the backdrop of the \"average\" american family. who better to use than jimmy stewart and carol lombard? and, it should be noted that the film was released in early 1939; so, it was planned in 1938 â– soon after the usa began to get production going for the coming world war ii. hence, this sort of film was a great booster for the general public, at that time, many of who would soon have to join england in war. as many here would know, hollywood and washington formed an uneasy alliance before, during and after the war. however, i\\'m glad i saw it â– as a piece of disguised socio-political propaganda. but, i\\'ll have to see other lombard films to gain a better appreciation of her acting range. as another reviewer noted: see this one just to say that you\\'ve seen all of stewart\\'s movies; otherwise, don\\'t bother. unfortunately the only spoiler in this review is that there\\'s nothing to spoil about that movie.even if b. mattei had never done any master piece he use to do his job with a bit of humor and craziness that made him a fun eurotrash director. but for the last 10 years he seemed to have lost it.this film is just empty, nothing at all to wake us up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first 10 min.no sex, no blood(it\\'s suppose to be about snuff?),no actors, no dialogs, just as bad as an 90\\'t.v film.it\\'s even worse than his last cannibals and zombies epics.so rest in peace bruno, you will stay in our minds forever anyway, thanks to such unforgettable gems as:zombi 3, robowar,rats, l\\'altro inferno,virus, cruel jaws and few others.so except if you want to see b mattei possessed by jess franco\\'s spirit\\'s new film, pass on this one.but if you don\\'t know this nice artisan\\'s career track down his old films and have fun. i enjoyed watching this well acted movie very much!it was well acted,particularly by actress helen hunt and actors steven weber and jeff fahey.it was a very interesting movie,filled with drama and suspense,from the beginning to the very end.i reccomend that everyone take the time to watch this made for television movie,it is excellent and has great acting!! hypothetical situations abound, one-time director harry ralston gives us the ultimate post-apocalyptic glimpse with the world dead, left in the streets, in the stores, and throughout the landscape, sans in the middle of a forgotten desert. one lone survivor, attempting to rekindle his sanity, takes food from the city to his bungalow in this desert. all alone, he hopes for more, but with nobody around, he is left with white underwear, and a passion for a local indian tribe â– until the discovery of a camera which opens up new doors and breaks the barriers of human co-existence. alan, a man of the book, is left on earth after an unknown disaster. thinking he is alone, he begins living life his way â– until, jeri ryan, appears (like she would in any dream) out of the woods, disheveled, and unhappy to find the final man alive to be ... well ... like alan. anyway, they try to co-exist, fail, get drunk, and before creating the ultimate dystopia, they run into redneck raphael (played by newcomer â– dan montgomery jr). bonds are torn, confusion sets in, a couple becomes a third wheel, and the battle between physically inept nerd vs. brainless jock. even with nobody left on the planet, it becomes a truth that even the darkest of human nature will arise. using a variable film technique, ralston gives us a mediocre story based loosely on another film entitled \"the quiet earth\" (which i will be viewing next) oddly which he never gives any credit towards. with a borrowed story, i guess he does a decent job of reinterpreting it. his punch seems to be lacking at the beginning while ralston tries to find his stride, borrowing yet again from other film director\\'s techniques to attempt to find his own. he opens the film interestingly enough, but fails to answer any direct answers. sure, the final days have arrived, but could there be a concise answer as to \"how\" or better yet \"why\" these select few survived. a spookier beginning would have led us stronger into a comical film. the juxtaposition would have been like \"shawn of the dead\", but instead left us feeling like we were watching a \"made-for-tv\" program. listening to the audio commentary, i have respect for ralston because he worked diligently to get this film made, and his passion nearly sells the film, but you could tell from his interaction with the cast that he wasn\\'t as happy with his overall final product. there were mistakes, ones that he pointed out and others that he was ashamed to point out. while this does make for decent independent film-making, it sometimes feels cheap, and in ralston\\'s case, it was the latter. i must admit, david arnott\\'s portrayal of alan hooked me. he played that wimpy, school nerd, adult role very well. he was funny to both watch and listen to, and thus he became sympathetic to the viewer. he was a key player in keeping the film together, alas, i cannot say the same for the rest. this was dan montgomery\\'s first film, and it was obvious â– i mean â– really really obvious. there were scenes in which i thought the cue card was about to come out and read the lines for him, perhaps even giving us a more realistic performance, but alas, it wasn\\'t the case. then there was jeri ryan. she pulled into her character near the end of the film, which to me, was the culmination of the entire piece of art. she goes from estranged unknown to bitter cranky insane girlfriend by the end. confused? again, she fell into her character by the end, giving us just a glimpse of what she could have probably done as her acting matured. even as the commentary progressed, all that she contributed was a laugh, giggle, or \"ohhh, look at that color\" moment. while her beauty may sell tickets, one may want to consider knowledge to be just as beautiful. this was her first film, so can i be too harsh? overall, this film felt like it was missing something. i though the idea was strong â– the premise that even with only a peppering of people remaining on the earth the evil of human nature still exists. jealousy cannot be killed by bacteria or bombs (maybe because it is consumed by zinc?) and we as a race will always want what we cannot have. ralston is not a surprising director, his techniques are flawed and pre-used, but he does know how to make a low-budget comedy. i think our idea of \"funny\" is different, so that is why i couldn\\'t find myself laughing at many of the bits he found \"hysterical\". his actors provided the level of acting needed for this film, which was lower than average. his film was loose, meaning that there were elements never quite explained or tackled (i.e. anything with wings survived?!?), which overall harmed the intensity of the film. this was a comedy, but it could have been much darker and much much funnier. for those thinking that roger avery was a huge element to this film, as we learn from their commentary, all he was there for was money â– the was in essence, the bank for \"the last man\". don\\'t get your hopes up for any classic avery moments. don\\'t expect more from ralston â– and that is how i will end it. grade: ** out of ***** i must admit, i was expecting something quite different from my first viewing of \\'cut\\' last night, though was delighted with the unexpected australian horror gem. i am a true horror fan as true as they come, and found \\'cut\\' to not only be the best of the genre australia has ever produced, but one of the great parody/comedy films of late. my only concern is that mainstream audiences may not pick up on a lot of the comedic elements - the film was not overly clever in it\\'s application but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in every possible cliche of the horror genre they could. i am certain this was intended as humour....hoping this was intended as humour. and of course, there was the gore. the use of the \\'customised\\' garden shears was brilliance - besides the expected stabs and slashes. in short, there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths, enough to please even the skeptics of this films worth. the appearance of both kylie minogue (short that her appearance was) and molly ringwald was just another reason to see the film - both performances were fantastic, as well as simon bossell (\\'the castle\\') in a brilliant role as the jokey technician. all in all, i think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years, as well as a beautiful satire/parody - toungue-in-cheek till the very end. loved it. go see it! i am so happy not to live in an american small town. because whenever i\\'m shown some small town in the states it is populated with all kinds of monsters among whom flesh hungry zombies, evil aliens and sinister ghosts are most harmless. in this movie a former doctor, who\\'s just done time for an accidental killing of his wife in a car crash, directs his steps to the nearest small town - he must have never in his life seen a flick about any small towns - which happens to be the purgatory flats. and, of course, as soon as he arrives there all the hell breaks loose. he meets a blond chick who out of all creatures most resembles a cow both in facial expressions and in brain functioning and at once falls in love with her. but there is a tiny handicap, she is already married to a very small-time drug dealer who in a minute gets himself shot pitifully not dead. to know what has come out of all this you should watch the movie for yourself. i\\'ll just tell you that it\\'s slightly reminiscent of u turn by oliver stone but is a way down in all artistic properties. like anyone else who bought this, i was duped by the \"20 pieces of extreme gore\" and \"banned in 20 countries\" or whatever it says in the box. i have to admit i am a huge gore fan and i am always amazed when films can lay it on thick and look convincing doing it. tom savini, rick baker and greg cannom are some of the best in the business. the revolutionized make-up effects in the 80\\'s. today, you don\\'t need them as everything is done on computer. but computers cannot compare to the visual wizardry that these three men could conjure up. but i digress. watching fantastically gory films like fulci\\'s gates to hell or even savini\\'s crowning achievement, friday the 13th the final chapter, you can appreciate all that goes into making a terrifically gory film. you can\\'t tell the difference between reality and magic. i can\\'t imagine another reason why anyone would see cannibal ferox but the gore that is ostensibly omnipotent in this film. if that is the reason you seek this film, then you are wasting your money. as many other reviewers in here have noted, most of the gore is an aftermath. you don\\'t see the torture, or the bloodshed as it happens, you see whatever it looks like afterwords. the gore? well, it\\'s here, but not as much as one would hope, or expect. a man does get castrated and a women does get hanged by her breasts, but other then those two scenes, and one involving a scalping; there is nothing really much else to this film. the scenes of gore even in these three mentioned, are still pretty tame in comparison to what you were hoping for. maybe it\\'s just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre, but i was expecting a bit more. call me sick or twisted, but isn\\'t that the only reason people are watching this film in the first place? i honestly found myself bored in a lot of places. cannibal ferox is just another film that tries to capitalize on a craze of a superior film. while cannibal holocaust is not exactly a great film, it is much better than this tripe. if you go out of your way to buy this for $20.00, you will feel cheated. 3/10 i always felt that ms. merkerson had never gotten a role fitting her skills. familiar to millions as the lt. on law and order, she has been seen in a number of theatrical releases, always in a supporting role. hbo\\'s lackawanna blues changes that and allows this talented actress to shine as nanny, successful entrepreneur in a world changing from segregation to integration. but the story is really about the colorful array of characters that she and her adopted son meet in a boarding house in lackawanna, new york, a suburb of buffalo. the story could be set in any major african-american community of the 50\\'s and 60\\'s from atlanta\\'s sweet auburn to new york\\'s harlem. but the segregation-integration angle is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the folks at nanny\\'s boarding house. the story revolves around nanny\\'s relationships with all kinds of people, played by some of the best actors in the business (i purposely did not say black actors--this ensemble is a stunning array of talent who happen to be black, except for jimmy smits, of course) i recommend this film as a fun and colorful look at a bygone day. this will not likely be voted best comedy of the year, a few too many coincidences and plot holes. however we are talking about a movie where a hit-man and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries shouldn\\'t come as too much of a surprise. brosnan is excellent in this role, gone is the wooden james bond (a role he was wasted in). if he can maintain this kind of quality i hope he continues to make comedies. greg kinnear is also excellent as brosnan\\'s straight man. i\\'ve read a few negative comments in here about hope davis but i thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within. there are lots of good chuckles as brosnan sleazes his way through and a few scenes where i nearly died laughing. my father (a consultant) nearly lost it when julian describes himself as a \"facilitator\". much like \"grosse pointe blank\", another hit-man comedy, the humour can be very dark. if you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself. as a casual listener of the rolling stones, i thought this might be interesting. not so, as this film is very \\'of its age\\', in the 1960\\'s. to me (someone born in the 1980\\'s) this just looks to me as hippy purist propaganda crap, but i am sure this film was not made for me, but people who were active during th \\'60\\'s. i expected drugs galore with th stones, i was disappointed, it actually showed real life, hard work in the studio, so much so i felt as if i was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film. i have not seen any of the directors other films, but i suspect they follow a similar style of directing, sort of \\'amatuerish\\' which gave a feeling like the tv show eurotrash, badly directed, tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value. my only good opinion of this is that i didn\\'t waste money on it, it came free with a sunday paper. watch the original with the same title from 1944! this made for tv movie, is just god-awful! although it does use (as far as i can tell) almost the same dialog, it just doesn\\'t work! is it the acting, the poor directing? ok so it\\'s made for tv, but why watch a bad copy, when you can get your hands on the superb original? especially as you\\'ll be spoiled to the plot and won\\'t enjoy the original as much, as if you\\'ve watched it first! there are a few things that are different from the original (it\\'s shorter for once), but all are for the worse! the actors playing the parts here, just don\\'t fit the bill! you just don\\'t believe them and who could top edward g. robinsons performance from the original? if you want, only watch it after you\\'ve seen the original and even then you\\'ll be very brave, if you watch it through! it\\'s almost sacrilege! director don siegel really impressed me with this film. it is starkly shot, graphic without being visually graphic, well-acted by all concerned, and covers some of the most taboo issues of any day in a workmanlike, almost expected normalcy hitherto not seen in any other film by this reviewer. i didn\\'t know what to expect sitting down to watch this: a civil war movie or some kind of 70\\'s soft-core peddling with eastwood descending on a school for girls in the south. but really is is neither of those things but rather and examination, exploration, and descent into the soul of men and women - a dark commentary on what is at the core of the civilized. as one reviewer previously noted, none - none - of the characters are likable by the film\\'s end and yet each one is interesting, complex, and enigmatic. eastwood plays cpl. mcburney, a union soldier found by young pamelyn ferdin(you\\'ll recognize that voice as soon as you hear it), a girl at a school for manners headed by geraldine page amidst the chaos that was the civil war - particularly in the south. soon, page, teacher elizabeth hartman, lovely, young seductress carol, and even ferdin(amy)have emotional/sexual ties to eastwood - each having their own needs and secrets and problems. eastwood is not a nice man. he plays the girls off of each other always trying to get the sexual advantage. in the unfolding we get some real interesting things revealed from latent lesbianism to incest. the beguiled, for me, is a masterpiece that far exceeded my expectations on every creative front. this might be(except for invasion of the body snatchers) siegel\\'s best film. it certainly is one of eastwood\\'s best real performances. page is always so very good and hartman, fe5rdin, et al excellent. the gothic manse set for the school is effectively claustrophobic. some of the sexual-laced scenes disturbing. and what happens to eastwood is a leg up on much of the competition for creepy, eerie, demented film. anyone who lived through the ages of revenge of the nerds and girlpower will appreciate this film. it is one of those films that delivers everything you want in a \"spring break movie\" plus it makes fun of the college film genre. it\\'s funny, it\\'s got a cast to die for (amy pohler! rachel dratch!, sophie monk!, parker posey! jane lynch! amber tamblyn! missi pyle!) and its guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. writer/ actor rachel dratch is a comic genius and sophie monk is such a great villain. wilson phillips! omg! (i\\'m just repeating myself now...) it will live on with girls who like miranda july but feel like eating ice cream and pretending they\\'re dumb. arguably the finest serial ever made(no argument here thus far) about earthman flash gordon, professor zarkov, and beautiful dale arden traveling in a rocket ship to another universe to save the planet. along the way, in spellbinding, spectacular, and action-packed chapters flash and his friends along with new found friends such as prince barin, prince thun, and the awesome king vultan pool their resources together to fight the evils and armies of the merciless ming of mongo and the jealous treachery of his daughter priness aura(now she\\'s a car!). this serial is not just a cut above most serials in terms of plot, acting, and budget - it is miles ahead in these areas. produced by universal studios it has many former sets at its disposable like the laboratory set from the bride of frankenstein and the opera house from the phantom of the opera just to name a few. the production values across the board are advanced, in my most humble opinion, for 1936. the costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are really creative and first-rate. we get hawk-men, shark men, lion men, high priests, creatures like dragons, octasacks, orangapoids, and tigrons(oh my!)and many, many other fantastic things. are all of them believable and first-rate special effects? no way. but for 1936 most are very impressive. the musical score is awesome and the chapter beginnings are well-written, lengthy enough to revitalize viewer memories of the former chapter, and expertly scored. director frederick stephani does a great job piecing everything together wonderfully and creating a worthy film for alex raymond\\'s phenom comic strip. lastly, the acting is pretty good in this serial. all too often serials have either no names with no talent surrounding one or two former talents - here most everyone has some ability. don\\'t get me wrong, this isn\\'t a shakespeare troupe by any means, but buster crabbe does a workmanlike, likable job as flash. he is ably aided by jean arden, priscella lawson, and the rest of the cast in general with two performers standing out. but before i get to those two let me add as another reviewer noted, it must have been amazing for this serial to get by the hayes office. i see more flesh on flash and on jean rogers and priscella lawson than in movies decades later. the shorts crabbe(and unfortunately for all of us professor zarkov((frank shannon)) wears are about as form-fitting a pair of shorts guys can wear. the girls are wearing mid drifts throughout and are absolutely beautiful jean rogers may have limited acting talent but she is a blonde bombshell. lawson is also very sultry and sensuous and beautiful. but for me the two actors that make the serial are charles middleton as ming: officious, sardonic, merciless, and fun. middleton is a class act. jack \"tiny\" lipson plays king vultan: boisterous, rousing, hilarious - a symbol for pure joy in life and the every essence of hedonism. lipson steals each and every scene he is in. the plot meanders here, there, and everywhere - but flash gordon is the penultimate serial, space opera, and the basis for loads of science fiction to follow. excellent! i have to say that the events of 9/11 didn\\'t hit me until i saw this documentary. it took me a year to come to grips with the devastation. i was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channel on tv if there was any talk about the towers. i was sick of hearing about it. when this was aired on tv a year and a day later, i was bawling my eyes out. it was the first time i had cried since the attack. i highly recommend this documentary. i am watching it now on tv, 5 years later, and i am still crying over the tragedies. the fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing. it was an accident, and look where it got them. these two brothers make me want to have been there to help. perfect movies are rare. even my favorite films tend to have flaws - rear window looks a little stagey at times, chris elliot\\'s character in groundhog day doesn\\'t work, the music score in best years of our lives is too cheesy, the beginning of nights of cabiria is a little too slow - but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish. the script is brilliant, the acting is superb all around (although reese witherspoon and sam waterston are amazing, the whole cast shines), the directing and the photography are inspired, and the music score is touching without being intrusive (like some miramax scores that are too manipulative). every sad moment is truly moving, every light moment makes me smile. this truly is one of the best films i have ever seen and i wish there were more films like it. i am glad that reese witherspoon has gone on to stardom after this film, but i am sorry to see that her recent movies are so much more escapist and silly than this serious film which is about real people, real feelings and real problems. brilliant! a must-see. this has to be one of the 5 worst movies ever made. the plot looked intriguing like that of passenger 57. but with the latter movie it somehow worked a lot better. the plot has been worked out in the worst possible way. just a few of the awful moments in the movie, a flight attendant is standing in the opened doorway of a flying 747 and trying to close the door without being sucked out by the 250 mile per hour winds?!? thereafter the lands the aircraft from a few miles out starting at 8000 feet, thats impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hour experience. when on the runway (perfectly straight of course) she is instructed to pull on the flaps, huh!! come on flaps are there to ensure lift at low speeds, when on the runway you use thrust reverse on the engines and give maximum power! i can go on and on about little and mostly big mistakes in the movie, but then my reply would become the size of the english dictionary. this is a movie you want to miss, take my word for it! regardless of what anyone says, its a b-movie, and the effects are poorly done.. if you\\'re a vampire fanatic, i suppose it would be ok, not 10 out of 10, you others here cant sincerely mean that?. we are to view this as a movie, not read it as a book, so the effects and characters are important, as well as the story. the story are good, but it doesn\\'t carry the film, no wonder it has a low rating over all. i write this because i chose to see this movie when i saw some good reviews here on imdb, but got severely disappointed. don\\'t get me wrong, i thought the blade movies was awesome, and loved the underworld movies, but this characters aren\\'t close. the make up on the vampires is poorly done, and the effects are worse. this sucks. i might not have gotten so disappointed if i had not read reviews here that told me how great it was. the reviewers must have had something to do with the production company or something, seriously, if you think this is awesome, you don\\'t care about acting or make up. this is better as a book. 3 out of 10 for an ok story.. i want very much to believe that the above quote (specifically, the english subtitle translation), which was actually written, not spoken, in a rejection letter a publisher sends to the protagonist, was meant to be self-referential in a tongue-in-cheek manner. but if so, director leos carax apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film. they are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayals that i have to conclude carax actually takes himself seriously here, or else has so much disdain for everyone, especially the viewing audience, that he can\\'t be bothered letting anyone in on the joke. some auteurs are able to get away with making oblique, bizarre films because they do so with ã©lan and unique personal style (e.g., david lynch and alejandro jodorowsky). others use a subtler approach while still weaving surreal elements into the fabric of the story (e.g., krzysztof kieslowski, and david cronenberg\\'s later, less bizarre works). in pola x, carax throws a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dares him to find fault with it. well, here it is: the pacing is erratic and choppy, in particular continuity is often dispensed with; superfluous characters abound (e.g., the gypsy mother and child); most of the performances are overwrought; the lighting is often poor, particularly in the oft-discussed sex scene; unconnected scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason; and the list goes on. not to be completely negative, it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions. i liked the musical score, even the cacophonous industrial-techno music being played in the sprawling, abandoned complex to which the main characters retreat in the second half of the film (perhaps a reference to andy warhol\\'s \\'factory\\' of the \\'60s?). much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful, an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city settings. and, even well into middle-age, cathering deneuve shows that she still has \\'it\\'. her performance was also the only one among the major characters that didn\\'t sink into bathos. there was an earlier time when i would regard such films as \"pola x\" more charitably. experimentation is admirable, even when the experiment doesn\\'t work. but carax tries nothing new here; the film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from countless earlier films, and after several decades of movie-viewing and literally thousands of films later, i simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal, poorly crafted tripe. at this early moment in the 21st century, one is left asking: with the exception of jean-pierre jeunet, are there *any* directors in france who know how to make a watchable movie anymore? rating: 3/10. it\\'s hard to praise this film much. the cgi for the dragon was well done, but lacked proper modelling for light and shadow. also, the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through corridors which becomes slightly tedious. i was amazed to see \"marcus aurelius\" in the acting credits, wondering what an ex-emperor of the roman empire was doing acting in this film! like \"whoopie goldberg\" it must be an alias, and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this stinker. the story might been interesting, but the acting is flat, and direction is tedious. if you must watch this film, go around to your friend\\'s house and get drunk while doing so - then it\\'ll be enjoyable. i remember going to see the movie in the summer of \\'78 with my parents, and being pretty into it at the time. of course, i was seven at the time. right before the jackson movies came out, my wife and i rented this movie since she had never seen it and i was feeling nostalgic. ralph bakshi ran out of money about mid-way through the animation process for this movie, and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production. since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping, the animation technique for people on a budget, this is saying something. much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word. there are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen, with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of them. because of budget constraints, the movie -- already a compression of \"the fellowship of the rings\" and part of \"the two towers\" -- was pared down even more. what you get is sort of like a film-strip version of the cliff notes of the books. its not all bad, though, the animation brings a warmth to it, that i found lacking in the jackson movies. its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent funding. this movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came. several years later, a half-hearted half-hour long tv special was aired, which was meant to wrap things up. all i will say about that is that it was a musical. just finished watching 2ftm. the trailers intrigued me so much i actually went to see it on opening weekend, something i never do. needless to say i was very disappointed. the story has so much potential and it\\'s frustrating to see it get screwed up. i really feel the problem with the movie was the directing and matthew mcconaughey. first off i am not a mm hater, i thought he was awesome in both reign of fire and lone star. i enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt off 3-4 times. yes we all get it that he a good-looking guy with a nice body, but i think most people knew this 10 years ago when he came on the scene in a time to kill. showing him with his shirt off pumping iron like a sweaty madman 3-4 times in the movie is totally unnecessary. i think one time would have been sufficient. it wouldn\\'t surprise me if they threw those unnecessary scenes in so girlfriends and wives would be willing to tag along with their significant other, no woman wants to see a movie about sports gambling, unless......enough about that, let\\'s get into his role. i feel his acting was very forced and he didn\\'t seem very comfortable. i know his character was supposed to be this charming southerner, but his lines were corny and cheesy. it was almost like he was referencing days and confused lines a few times! in short, i didn\\'t like his character even though i was supposed to. the accent, his shirt off, corny pick up lines, weak sales pitches. his character was just too much of a tool, as brandon or jonathan. pacino and assante were great, but that\\' no surprise. piven is fun to watch as arie....oooops i mean jerry. i just feel this movie was very commercial and put together poorly. it\\'s insulting that they could take a great story, and throw in crap ingredients to try and make it a box office success. 1. cool story that appeals to the male man 2. hunky hollywood actor for female women (make sure he has numerous scenes with shirt off lifting weights) 3. al pacino with 4 great speech scenes, and 25 great one liners 3. every character shall be dressed in thousand dollars suites and have an extremely dark tan 4. jeremy piven to play the same character he did in entourage and old school 4. throw in armand assante to seal the deal 5. plot, good writing, character development, and intelligent casting are unnecessary this will be good enough for most people, but not me! anybody who disagrees with me, ask your self this. would this movie be much better if: a. directed by sodeberg b. decaprio or ed norton as brandon instead of mm i will probably be part of the minority in thinking this movie sucks. i realized this when the woman next to me started crying during the ridiculous ending scene of pacino shedding a fake tear while embracing russo. the financial success of this movie will ensure one thing. the movie going public gets what the movie going public wants, big budget crapola. i was watching the sci-fi channel when this steaming pile of crap came on. while not as bad as wynorski\\'s \"curse of the komodo\", this still sucks...bad. wynorski uses the same island as in \"curse of the komodo\", as well as the same actors and house. the effects are top notch (suprising) but thats about it........i don\\'t know what else to say about this movie.......oh yeah! as in \"curse of the komodo\", the government gets involved and decides to bomb the island! also....when i saw this part i laughed hysterically...a komanbra!!! (part man, komodo and cobra!). overall this movie is utter crap even on bad movie standards. just remember if jim wynorski had anything to do with a movie....steer clear....to avoid from falling asleep keep repeating \"it\\'s almost over..it\\'s almost over...\". 0 out of 5. i only heard about driving lessons through the itv adverts, and to be honest, i didn\\'t know how much i would like it. i switched on the tv last night and was totally surprised. driving lessons is a modest, simple film which draws you in right from the start. rupert grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager ben brilliantly. he\\'s definitely one to look out for in the future. dame eve walton is played by the fabulous julie walters. i loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity. the highlight of the film, for me was evie\\'s rather colourful poem. it shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely pairs. in my opinion, watching driving lessons is a great way to spend 2 hours. the scenery was also striking, especially the countryside. anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable, i strongly disagree with for greta garbo\\'s first talking picture, mgm wisely chose eugene o\\'neill\\'s pultizer prize winning 1921 play anna christie. also wisely, the producers backed garbo up with not one but two members of the original broadway cast (george marion as anna\\'s father, chris, and james t. mack as johnny the priest - transmuted to \"johnny the harp\" for films so as not to offend). this little change is interesting. like too many films accused (by those who want movies to be movies and ignore their origins) of being \"little more than filmed stage plays,\" the problem is not the play but the movie makers who wouldn\\'t be more faithful to the property. by diluting a great cinematic stage work so it wouldn\\'t offend anyone, or opening it up because they could, too many lose the very qualities which made the piece worth filming in the first place. fortunately, the respect the studio had for both o\\'neill and garbo allowed anna christie to survive the normally destructive process admirably in frances marion\\'s generally sensitive screen adaptation. wonder of wonders, marion even allows the point of the scene where garbo\\'s anna reveals her past on \"the farm\" to the man she badly wants to marry and the father who sent her there in tact! what the league of decency must have thought of that! the source play\\'s greatest problem has always been that chris\\'s friend marthy tends to walk away with the first act and then disappears from the last two so that anna can take stage - the two sides of the genuinely good woman men don\\'t always recognize. the perfectly cast marie dressler (who had cut her teeth on the broadway stage as well before going to hollywood) is the perfect balance for garbo\\'s anna in this area as well and the fast moving film at only 90 minutes, doesn\\'t allow us too much time to miss her - one of the few benefits from atmosphere being shown rather than eloquently described in the original - and screenwriter marion is wise enough to stray from o\\'neill to bring dressler back for a touching scene two thirds of the way through the film that will remind many of julie laverne\\'s second act appearance in show boat. anna and marthy\\'s early scene together on screen (16 minutes into the film) taking each other\\'s measure and setting up all the tension of the rest of the story is among the most affecting scenes in the entire piece. not to be missed. anna christie is great tragic play and a good film drama. it\\'s hard to imagine that a latter day remake, which would almost certainly lose the grit and atmosphere of this 1930 remake (it was first filmed without sound in 1923 - also with george marion\\'s original broadway chris) could improve on this excellent filming. the internal scenes hew closest to the play, but the exteriors shouldn\\'t be missed by anyone with an eye to atmosphere. while the background screen work is not to modern technical standards, the backgrounds give a better glimpse than most films of the era of the actual world in which the screen play is set (especially in the new york harbor). nearly all garbo\\'s naturalistic performances of the sound era have held up superbly (only the too often parodied death scene from camille, 7 years later, will occasionally draw snickers because of the heavy handed direction and the parodies), but this anna christie, together with the variety of her 1932 films, mata hari and grand hotel, and the sublime lubitsch touch on her 1939 comedy, ninotchka (\"garbo laughs!\"), surely stand as her best. o\\'neill fans who are taken with this play at the edge of his lauded \"sea plays,\" should track down the fine world war ii shaped film released in the year before the u.s. entered the conflict, the long voyage home (1940). it is almost as skillfully drawn from those sea plays as this one is from anna christie, and features a youngish john wayne in one of his rare non-westerns supporting a fine cast of veteran actors showing him the way. let me set the scene. it is the school holidays and there is absolutely nothing at the movies. i am with my friend deciding what to see. we look for a movie that is starting soon and \"the grinch\" comes up. we buy tickets not knowing what to expect. what we got was a roller coaster of fun. jim carrey (who may i add is my no.1 actor in the whole world) was absolutely magnificent as the grinch in this ron howard\\'s best movie (next to apollo 13). the way that this movie was made, the scenery, the actors, the props and the music was just amazing. it really brought this childhood movie to life. the story is based upon the story of the grinch. as we all know the grinch is a horrible person who just can\\'t stand christmas. he lives high above whoville and has never mingled well with the townfolk. but one little girl is going to change the grinch\\'s look on life and on others in a drastic way. cindy lou who (played by adorable new actress taylor momsem) meets the grinch as finds the kind part of him straight away. she attempts to break the barrier and to help the grinch move in and mingle with the towns people. all up this movie is a barrel of laughs for the whole family both kids and parents. a solid 10/10. well done jim. as a long-time fan of all the star trek series,i found this a disappointing episode, and i wonder if the liberal use of \"flashbacks\" featuring will riker\\'s exploits, both positive (and largely romantic) and negative (lots of pain, and a crewmate\\'s death)was a money-saving device, as were many of their \"bottle shows\" (episodes in which all scenes take place on the enterprise). diana muldaur(who also appeared at least twice on the original series) deserved a better final appearance than this for her character, dr. kate pulaski. loyal viewers (in the star trek world, is there any other kind?) also were shortchanged. this was the last episode of second season; thus, the season ended \"not with a bang\" but with \"a whimper.\" this tv-series was one of the ones i loved when i was a kid. even though i see it now through the pink-shaded glasses of nostalgia, i can still tell it was a quality show, very educational but still funny. i have not seen the original french version, only the swedish. i have no idea how good the dubbing was, it was too long ago to remember. the premise of the show was to show you how the body works. i swear, school still hasn\\'t taught me half of what i know from this show. it also tied in other things, like what happens if you eat unhealthy food and don\\'t exercise, with nice examples within the body. who wants to have another bar of chocolate when you know miniature virus tanks can invade you? :d the cartoon looked nice, very kids friendly of course, but done with care. cells, viruses, electric signals in the brain, antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon figures, looking pretty much how you\\'d expect what they should look like in the animated body. this, and the series about history(especially the environmentally scary finale) were key parts of my childhood. i\\'m so happy i found them here. fans of the hbo series \"tales from the crypt\" are going to love this moh episode. those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic ec comics were based on, will recognize this one right off the bat. underrated indie favorite martin donovan (also an excellent writer - co-author of the screenplays for apartment zero and death becomes her) is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way. he could play a really nice if misunderstood guy-next-door, or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness. in the case of right to die, he takes the latter approach, and it definitely works. donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist (robin sydney), much to the displeasure of his inconsolable, unforgiving spouse, abbey (julia anderson). when the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of \"making up,\" and she\\'s horribly burned in a fire, he\\'s reluctant to pull the plug on her, not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy (corbin bernsen, looking the worse for wear these days.) but abbey\\'s never been one to give up without a fight, and that\\'s where the ec-theme of the episode comes in. cuckolded husbands - and wives - have always been the genre\\'s favorite subject matter for some spooky (and ooky) supernatural shenanigans, and this case is definitely no exception. if anything, the ramped-up quotient of sex and gore must have bill gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere. and that\\'s not to mention that john esposito\\'s original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist. you don\\'t realize as you\\'re watching that you only know half the story, until close to the end...(think what lies beneath with more guts and gazongas, and you\\'re there.) not a bad effort, but not the best of the lot, either. at least rob schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction, especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed! as with most moh episodes, this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment, so the extremely squeamish need not apply. dirty war is absolutely one of the best political, government, and well written t.v. drama\\'s in the 25 years. the acting is superb, the writing is spectacular. diry war reveals the true side of why we are not ready to respond to a nuclear, biological, and radiological terrorist attack here on american soil. dirty war should be made into a major motion picture - it\\'s that good! i highly recommend this great drama to everyone who desire to know the truth. this t.v. drama reveals how british intelligence (mi5 & mi6) attempt to expose a terrorist plot and conspiracy to destroy innocent victims -because of england\\'s involvement in the iraq war. the scenes of different parts of london, england are also spectacular. dirty war is a must see!!! some may go for a film like this but i most assuredly did not. a college professor, david norwell, suddenly gets a yen for adoption. he pretty much takes the first child offered, a bad choice named adam. as it turns out adam doesn\\'t have both oars in the water which, almost immediately, causes untold stress and turmoil for dr. norwell. this sob story drolly played out with one problem after another, all centered around adam\\'s inabilities and seizures. why norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child was never explained. along the way the good doctor managed to attract a wifey to share in all the hell the little one was dishing out. personally, i think both of them were one beer short of a sixpack. bypass this yawner. this is the who at their most powerful. although before the masterwork who\\'s next, which would provide anthems like baba o\\'reily and wont get fooled again. this film shows the group in transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the 70\\'s. daltrey shows what being a front-man is all about, entwistle steady as ever. moon is great, check out the ongoing conversation with the drum tech, and see him playing \"side saddle\" whilst having a bass drum head replaced! townsend even looks like he\\'s enjoying himself occasionally! considering they took to the stage at 2am no one in the crowd was asleep! there are not many bands these days could produce a set as tight as this and it is difficult to imagine any of the bands of today producing a concert that in 36 years time will be be enjoyed as much as this one. this filmmaker wanted to make a movie without having a story to tell -- and did so. really awful jumble of unlikely/unexplained coincidences and unidentifiable plot line, all without character or clear motivation. we get clichã© snapshots instead of characters. one in particular is the diminutive and beautiful crime boss, who projects an overdone \"tough guy\" persona and casts a cartoonish shadow of intimidation over the actual tough guys who have been brought in to work for her. nothing much startling to look at in the film except for one shot when the boys hit the road and one of them carries a tiny suitcase (as in, the smallest from a complete american tourister set) in a bright, sky blue, without explanation or apology. otherwise it\\'s standard visually -- one other exception is a compelling shot of a beautiful bridge in ct. they filmed this movie out on long island, where i grew up. my brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie. apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer, (which they told me was colored water, tasted disgusting, and was very hard to keep swallowing over and over again, especially in the funnel scenes). yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form. it never came out in the theaters (obviously) and it, as far as i knew, was never released on video, and i\\'m sure wasn\\'t released on dvd. yet it looks like it was seen by some people, albeit it probably very few. so there must be something. i would absolutely love to purchase this for my brother, yet there is no way i can find it anywhere. does anybody know anything about when/where/how this movie could be purchased? and which format that would be? that\\'s how burt reynolds describes this film, which happens to be his best ever. he plays tom sharky, a vice detective who\\'s on the trail of an international mobster (vittorio gassman) and the man he\\'s financing to be the next governor of georgia (earl holliman). in the novel by william diehl, the story is more complex because the guy\\'s running for president. this is a very long movie that feels more like three hours instead of two. the filming in downtown atlanta and the peachtree plaza hotel sets the mood just right for the story. reynolds doesn\\'t do much laughing in this one compared to his comedy films. he\\'s very serious here, especially in the beginning of the movie because he gets demoted for a dope bust that goes wrong. at times though, the movie plays more like a voyeuristic drama than a crime film with burt trying to get close to the mobster\\'s woman. only towards the end of the film does the violence get cranked up that leads to the bang bang climax. just like the great jazz score in dirty harry by lalo schifrin, sharky\\'s machine features an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with many guest stars including chet baker, julie london, flora purim & buddy de franco, the manhattan transfer, doc severinson, sarah vaughan and joe williams. al capps handles the score with magic. this movie has become one of the best crime dramas ever. check it out. score, 8 out of 10 stars human traffic is a view into an average weekend for a group of friends, it is a fly-on-the-wall view into their lives (and minds) which will show you how this group of friends relate to each other. there are many moments in that every one can relate to, like being out of you skull at parties and talking complete rubbish to strangers. the characters are all people that you can relate to and they are believable in the roles that they play in the movie. the situations that they are in are all situations that we all have found ourselves in, and that is where this film succeeds. the topics of sex and drugs are handled superbly as to no get in the way of the characters relationships with each other. the story to the film is not all that, but that is not a criticism. this is a film about people. this is a well written film, with a sound track to die for. d.j\\'s pete tong has put together an superb selection of tracks for this file which all goes to make this one of the best films that i have seen in 1999. after watching this film i felt like i had been out partying all weekend. fantastic movie! jo brand as the voice of reality - need i say more! this early biograph short was so much fun to watch. the second on disc one of d.w. griffith\\'s \"years of discovery\" dvd set (highly recommended) it features three excellent performances by the main leads, and interesting to see henry b. walthall (the little colonel, birth of a nation) as a campy musician giving a countess the eye (and other things). the countess\\' husband goes berserk at his wife\\'s betrayal and has her walled into a little room with her paramour. it\\'s kind of incredible that they wouldn\\'t hear the wall going up, but hey, maybe the wine had something to do with it. here mr. johnson (father of silent player raymond hackett) gesticulates wildly and this adds to the melodrama, but in an unexpectedly comical way. the best moment comes at the end. as the lady passes out from shock and fear, once she realizes she\\'s doomed, henry picks up his instrument and \"fans\" it over her. the way he did it was so unexpected and in a strange way kind of sexy, and i just lost it, and laughed my head off. the expression on his face! from that moment i was charmed by henry b. walthall. baba - rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life. this is the movie which caused his downfall. it was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors. rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the losses incurred. soon after its release, he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably. its a very bad movie with horrible acting, bad-quality makeup and pathetic screenplay. throughout the movie, rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease. i\\'m one of the unfortunate souls who saw baba, first day first show in theatre. the audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the intermission. sorry, i\\'ll not recommend this one to anyone. written by oliver stone and directed by brian de palma, scarface paints a picture not easily forgotten. al pacino turns in a stunning performance as tony montana, a cuban refugee than becomes a powerful player in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his self made kingdom of crime in florida. this gangster flick is harsh, violent, loud, gross, unpleasant and must hold the record for uttering the word \"f--k\" the most number of times. almost three hours long, and yes it can get repulsive. a stout hearted constitution keeps you in your seat cheering for the demise of a ruthless crime lord. also playing interesting characters are michelle pfeiffer, steven bauer, robert loggia, mary elizabeth mastrantonio, f. murray abraham and angel salazar. pacino proves to be one of the greatest of his generation. he manages to bring reality to his character that leaves a strong impression. this will not be a movie for everyone for you leave thinking you walked away from a disaster. is that powerful enough for you? crime does not pay for long! first, the cgi in this movie was horrible. i watched it during a marathon of bad movies on the scifi channel. at the end when the owner of the park gets killed, it\\'s probably one of the worst examples of cgi i have even seen. even night of the living dead had better animation. that said, the movie had almost no plot. why were they on that island in particular? well, it wasn\\'t stated in the movie. and, why would the people keep coming into the cat\\'s area? makes no sense. one thing that stood out in this movie was moderately good acting. in what could be called a \"b made for tv movie\" movie, the acting was very good. parry shen stood out in particular. if you have absolutely nothing to do on a saturday, watch this movie. it may be good for some memorable quotes. i enjoyed it. there you go, i said it again. i even bought this movie on dvd and enjoyed it a couple of more times. call me old fashioned but i prefer movies like this to garbage like die hard 4 which hold up the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have some old guy saving america. van damme moves well for a guy of his age(47 i think), delivering kicks that reminds one of kickboxer. if you like old school action and and explosions, this is the movie to watch. this is one of van damme\\'s best works. van damme and steven seagal movies get released theatrically where i live so i never miss a chance to watch our old school action stars on the big screen. what a waste of talent. a very poor, semi-coherent, script cripples this film. rather unimaginative direction, too. some very faint echoes of _fargo_ here, but it just doesn\\'t come off. although it strays away from the book a little, you can\\'t help but love the atmospheric music and settings. the scenes in bath are just how they should be. although if you have watched it as many times as i have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene, but that aside, i like the scene where they are in the hot baths, but did the men and women really bathe together like that? you could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women. it also seemed strange that they all had their hats on, but perhaps this was the style at the time. the ballroom scenes were very nice, the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful. i especially liked catherine\\'s dress in the first ballroom scene. northanger abbey looked suitably imposing, but i enjoyed the bath scenes better. schlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as catherine morland. googie withers gives the best performance as mrs allen i feel. ugh peter firth as mr tilney, he just talks a load of rubbish, and is not a clergyman as he should be, it\\'s hard to think of him being in love with catherine, but then the book never really gave that impression either. general tilney is played reasonably well by hardy, and stuart also gives a sort of good performance as isabella. ingrid lacey did not give a good performance as elinor tilney. as for john thorpe, well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man, perhaps not the character portrayed in the book, but i quite like it. i can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation, but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me. the marchioness! i hate her. she is not part of the northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boy. some of the script is peculiar. when catherine is asking elinor tilney about her mothers death she asks \"i suppose you saw the body? how did it appear?\" what a silly thing to say! elinor\\'s calm response is stupid too. anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me mario lewis of the competitive enterprise institute has written a definitive 120-page point-by-point, line-by-line refutation of this mendacious film, which should be titled a convenient lie. the website address where his debunking report, which is titled \"a skeptic\\'s guide to an inconvenient truth\" can be found at is :www.cei.org. a shorter 10-page version can be found at: www.cei.org/pdf/5539.pdf once you read those demolitions, you\\'ll realize that alleged \"global warming\" is no more real or dangerous than the y2k scare of 1999, which gore also endorsed, as he did the pseudo-scientific film the day after tomorrow, which was based on a book written by alleged ufo abductee whitley strieber. as james \"the amazing\" randi does to psychics, and philip klass does to ufos, and gerald posner does to jfk conspir-idiocy theories, so does mario lewis does to al gore\\'s movie and the whole \"global warming\" scam. a lovely little film about the introduction of motion pictures to china. captures the amazement of film\\'s first audiences pretty much as it\\'s described to have been worldwide, and uses actual lumiere films for most of the actualities. i don\\'t agree with other people about bad acting on the british fellow\\'s part - i thought he was fine, but the chinese lead really stole the show. in any case, i found myself with a smile on my face through most of the movie. people who fear subtitles might note that a lot of the film is in english (which for some reason is given subtitles as well as the chinese on the dvd). sigh. i\\'m baffled when i see a short like this get attention and assignments and whatnot. i saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker got any attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards. it was mildly annoying to see it swiping the grinch who stole christmas heart gag along with the narration, the set design seen many times before, the whole weak tim burton-ish style, and the story that goes nowhere. and we got the \"joke\" about shooting the crows with the 45 the first time, alright? but i guess what\\'s really unacceptable is that it even swipes its basic concept from a comic book circa 1999 called lenore, the cute little dead girl by roman dirge! as any quick internet search will reveal. i mean, what is this? this is what they base a hollywood contract on and opens doors in canada for a filmmaker? \"give your head a shake\" as don cherry might say. cute idea... salesgirl linda smith (yolande donlan) inherits a teeny tiny little county of lampidorra. that country, which wasn\\'t even in north america, was made the 49th state... (of course, there were only 48 states at the time, since this was made in 1952...) linda travels to the country she has inherited, and we follow her along as she tries to figure out what to do with this strange country and its even quirkier people. at one point, she sings a song that she claims is from her people the navajo, and it gets ever-more sillier from there.... although yolande donlan\\'s heavy lipstick and omni-present smile never get ruffled or shmeared. there are other songs scattered through-out as the citizens sing to welcome their new princess. filmed in a glorious british version of technicolor, or some such equivalent, about the only big name here is dirk bogarde as british subject tony craig, cheese vendor. bogarde made a big splash in the uk film industry after serving in the war, and was even knighted by qe ii. craig and \"the new princess\" keep bumping into each other, and their adventures become more intertwined as lampidorra\\'s financial problems worsen... fun little farce....along the lines of marx brothers film. also note that donlan later married val guest, the writer and director of our little project, and stayed married for 50 years! guest was better known for writing and directing his sci-fi flicks, in both the uk & the us. back in 1982 a little film called making love shocked audiences with its frank and open depiction of a romantic love story that just happened to be about two men. i have been waiting for years for a good, old-fashioned romance between two men; latter days is all that and more. yes, it is soapy, melodramatic, clichã©-ridden, and quite corny. that is what makes it so wonderful. there is nothing like a good romantic movie, and this movie is romantic in the best sense of the word. as to the issue of religion, sorry folks, but these things do happen and are happening to gay people even now. it is not just the mormon church that rejects its gay members. gay people in every religion have faced harsh judgment and rejection. i loved this movie. it has a perfect blend of a fantasy-romance grounded in the reality of the day-to-day lives of the characters. if i could give it more than ten stars i would. good love stories never go out of style; great love stories like latter days are unforgettable. it\\'s about time! the concept of having laurel & hardy this time in the role of chimney sweepers works out surprisingly hilarious. it guarantees some funny situations and silly antics, from especially stan laurel of course as usual. the movie also has a subplot with a nutty professor who is working on a rejuvenation formula. it doesn\\'t really sound like a logical mix of story lines and incoherent but both plot lines blend in perfectly toward the memorable ending. it\\'s still a bit weird but its funny nevertheless, so it works for the movie. the supporting cast of the movie is surprising good. sam adams is great as the stereotypical butler and lucien littlefield goes deliciously over-the-top as the nutty professor. the movie is filled with some excellent timed and hilarious constructed sequences, which are all quite predictable but become hilarious to watch nevertheless thanks to the way they are all executed. it all helps to make \"dirty work\" to be one of the better laurel & hardy shorts. 8/10 this movie came as a huge disappointment. the anime series ended with a relatively stupid plot twist and the rushed introduction of a pretty lame villain, but i expected shamballa to tie up all the loose ends. unfortunately, it didn\\'t. it added more plot holes than it resolved, and confused more than it clarified. the animation and voice acting were great, but with an idiotic plot, dull setting (most of the movie doesn\\'t even take place in dull wwii earth rather than the alchemy world), and disappointing ending (ed is useless for the rest of his days in a world with no alchemy, and he ditches winry?), it was altogether pretty lackluster. do yourself a favor-- disregard the last half of the anime as well as this movie, and read the manga. maybe i loved this movie so much in part because i\\'ve been feeling down in the dumps and it\\'s such a lovely little fairytale. whatever the reason, i thought it was pitch perfect. great, intelligent story, beautiful effects, excellent acting (especially de niro, who is awesome). this movie made me happier than i\\'ve been for a while. it is a very funny and clever movie. the running joke of the kingdom\\'s history of prince savagery and the aftermath, the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled. that\\'s much of what makes it so good; it\\'s an elaborate, special-effects-laden movie with more story than most fairytale movies, yet there is an incredible attention to small things. i feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again. i was surprised that \" forgiving the franklins \" did not generate more buzz at this years sundance film festival. there were times that the laughter at the screening i saw was so loud that you could barely hear the movie. the movie has some excellent acting and a story that really makes one examine broader issues . you know little issues like religion, sex and the truth. lots of comedy\\'s seem to rely on the same old corny contrived situations, many leave you thinking \" i know they ripped this off from some sitcom \" .this film takes off on its own unique direction . i really think that jay floyd did a fantastic job with a tight budget on this film. they must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the hollywood bus station. they then fill in the blanks and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived. you know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot, four young boys playing in grainy slow motion, accompanied by voice over narration. next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion. once they\\'re grown, it\\'s easy to spot the writer/director among the four. he\\'s the quiet, contemplative, long-haired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants. this means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from hickville to hollywood. only there\\'s no writing, or directing talent on display here. and if you still can\\'t figure out which one he is, here\\'s a hint: the auteur and his character have the same middle name. it took over an hour to figure out that these twenty-something men were supposed to still be in high school. what looked like a prison was apparently a high school, the warden turned out to be the principal. once more, the poor, misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement, murder and pillage, but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father. how about hitting back, kid, like you do everyone else? numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose. howlingly bad dialogue. many scenes badly out of focus. cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras, drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience. overacting in the extreme. and if you don\\'t quite get the self-important speeches, or the slow-motion scenes, just listen to the overbearing music. it will clue you in and what you\\'re supposed to feel. poor marisa ryan must be racking up lots of frequent flier mileage as she travels around the country working in these amateur regional films. the biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies, run over puppies chained to a tree, rob and steal, all the while complaining about their sad, sorry lives. but if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college. yeah, that\\'s the ticket. why is it that every twenty-something filmmaker believes that his life so far is so important, so interesting, that the world can\\'t wait to see it onscreen? if this movie is as autobiographical as it seems, then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policemen bearing fugitive warrants. i watched this movie so that you don\\'t have to! i have great respect for kris kristofferson, but what was he thinking? he did this for scale? at least the film\\'s title practices truth in advertising, since people and objects routinely disappear throughout the film, adding to the confusion. kristofferson mentions this in his commentary that even he wasn\\'t sure if genevieve bujold\\'s character really existed. this does not bode well for the viewer being able to follow the story! the \"making of\" feature was far more interesting than the movie itself. it explores the difficulty cobbling together funding for an indie, even as the film is being shot. to it\\'s credit, this movie is visually pleasing and doesn\\'t in any way look like a movie made with just slightly over 1m. too bad the money wasn\\'t spent on a better project. just saw this movie on opening night. i read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it... i must say, i was not impressed. i\\'m so unimpressed that i feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some money. first of all \"the messengers\" is very predictable, and just not much of a thriller. it might be scary for someone under 13, but it really did nothing for me. the climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movie\\'s resolution. furthermore the acting seemed a little superficial. some of the emotional arguments between the family were less convincing than the sub-par suspense scenes. if you\\'ve seen previews for this movie, then you\\'ve seen most of the best parts and have a strong understanding of the plot. this movie is not worth seeing in the theaters. i went to see this movie (actually i went to see family portraits, which contains cutting moments + 2 other short films by douglas buck) at the mar del plata festival (argentina)... i just couldn\\'t watch it! i had to cover my eyes after the 1st half of cutting moments and take a peek every once in a while. by the time it was over, my stomach was upside down and i felt light headed. i just had to leave the cinema a few minutes after the 2nd short begun (btw, of course i was not the only one who left the room). it was waaaay too violent and disgusting for me! i am impressed by the many brave people who actually loved it. i just don\\'t get how you can love that kind of movies! the shocking and bloody and horrible images i saw got really stuck in my head for like two days!! i also try to analyze the story (my boyfriend did see the whole thing and told me about it) and i just don\\'t think it makes any sense. i mean, that amount of violence and stuff, makes no other sense than to try to shock people. and that\\'s not a good enough reason, i think. there\\'s absolutely nothing in this movie that i can say \"well, at least \\'x\\' thing about it was good\". but well, i guess i will never understand that kind of films. a well-made run-of-the-mill movie with a tragic ending. pluses: the way the story moves - begins with soorya struggling to live followed by a long flashback about why he\\'s there. the music. a disinterested look at the life of policemen. minuses: the violence and the gore, but i guess they add to the realistic effects. still, having people\\'s heads chopped off and sent in boxes and sacks could have been avoided. no complaints - 7/10 i don\\'t understand the positive comments made about this film. it is cheap and nasty on all levels and i cannot understand how it ever got made. cartoon characters abound - sue\\'s foul-mouthed, alcoholic, layabout, irish father being a prime example. none of the characters are remotely sympathetic - except, briefly, for sue\\'s asian boyfriend but even he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence! as desperately unattractive as they both are, i\\'ve no idea why either rita and/or sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like bob - but given that they do, why should i be expected to care what happens to them? so many reviews keep carping on about how \"realistic\" it is. if that is true, it is a sad reflection on society but no reason to put it on film. i didn\\'t like the film at all. steven what have you done you have hit an all new low. it is weird since steven\\'s last film shadow man was directed by the same director who did this trash. shadow man was good this was diabolically bad so bad it wasn\\'t even funny steven is hardly in the movie and feels like he is in a cameo appearance and when he is in the film he is dubbed half the time anyway. as for the action well let\\'s just say the wizard of oz had more action than this trash there is hardly any action in the film and when it does finally arrive it is boring depressing badly shot so called action scenes. seagal hardly kills anyone unlike his over films where he goes one man army ie under siege 1 and 2 and exit wounds. the plot is so confusing with so many plot holes that it doesn\\'t make scenes sometimes. flight of fury better be good what a shame i wasted 5 pounds on this garbage 0 out of ten better luck next time a call-girl witnesses a murder and becomes the killer\\'s next target. director brian de palma is really on a pretentious roll here: his camera swoops around corners in a museum (after lingering a long time over a painting of an ape), divvies up into split screen for arty purposes, practically gives away his plot with a sequence (again in split screen) where two characters are both watching a tv program about transsexuals, and stages his (first) finale during a thunderous rainstorm. \"dressed to kill\" is exhausting, primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and gives back nothing substantial. much of the acting (with the exception of young keith gordon) is mediocre and the (second) finale is a rip-off of de palma\\'s own \"carrie\"--not to mention \"psycho\". the explanation of the dirty deeds plays like a spoof of hitchcock, not an homage. stylish in a steely cold way, the end results are distinctly half-baked. ** from **** *flat spoilers* five med students, nelson (kiefer sutherland), david labraccio (kevin bacon), rachel mannus (julia roberts), joe hurley (william baldwin) & randy steckle (oliver platt) decide to attempt an experiment; dying for exactly 5 minutes (it is the maximum amount of time somebody can do this before being risk of brain damage). almost everyone does this experiment, randy being the lone exception, but they begin to have unwelcome visitors; david sees a little black girl shouting crude insults to him, joe sees all the women he has had sex with (and which he videotaped) asking him why from the tv screen, rachel relives her father\\'s suicide and nelson faces a little boy with murderous intentions. why are they here? and how will they get rid of them? this tense and interesting movie, set in an hallucinated city and into a gothic med school, is quite the experience, both for the story and the characters, played by then-budding stars such as kiefer sutherland, julia roberts, oliver platt, kevin bacon and william baldwin. the director is joel schumacher, who had already worked with sutherland in \\'lost boys\\', and this second cooperation is even better than the first. a must for psychological-thriller-horror buds and metaphor lovers (this story is about forgiveness and righting of past wrongs), this is one of the minor classics from the \\'80s that get respect even today, like the mention by rebecca gayheart in \\'scream 2\\' or the tru calling episode which used the movie\\'s premise. flatliners: 9/10. one of my favorite shows back in the \\'70s. as i recall it went to air on friday (or possibly saturday)night on the nine network (?) here in australia. darren mcgavin and simon oakland were great together. each episode usually reached a climax with kolchack having to engage in hand to hand combat with some sort of supernatural opponent. to their credit, the writers made a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible. i remember one episode in which the adversary was the spirit of an ancient indian chief which/who \\'came back\\' as a massive electrical current which started to kill people in a city hospital. the final showdown saw kolchack trying to short circuit the \\'power beast\\' amidst an explosion of sparks and billowing flames. oh well .... you had to be there at the time but it was an interesting idea. mcgavin always packed a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and this was one of his best. definitely deserves a place in tv\\'s \"hall of fame\". to quote tony vincenzo .... \\'kolchack you are on it \\'... or, in the case of the hall of fame,\\'in it\\' ! i think my summary says it all. this mtv-ish answer to the classic candid camera tv show features a gen x (or is that gen y) type putting in false choppers and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses, and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations. example: kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his \"wedding.\" kennedy is the bride, done up in a full bridal gown and long wig. the \"joke\" is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his \"bits and pieces.\" problem is, this schtick goes on way too long, obviously to fill out time. and kennedy is about as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun. candid camera would have run three or four scenarios in the time it took kennedy to get through this one, running around, constantly asking \"do i look fat?\" i recognize the show was not made for me. it was made for 12-year-old pinheads who think jackass is the height of comedy today. so let them laugh. thank god the show was short-lived. frownland is like one of those intensely embarrassing situations where you end up laughing out loud at exactly the wrong time; and just at the moment you realize you shouldn\\'t be laughing, you\\'ve already reached the pinnacle of voice resoundness; and as you look around you at the ghostly white faces with their gaping wide-open mouths and glazen eyes, you feel a piercing ache beginning in the pit of your stomach and suddenly rushing up your throat and... well, you get the point. but for all its unpleasantness and punches in the face, frownland, really is a remarkable piece of work that, after viewing the inarticulate mess of a main character and all his pathetic troubles and mishaps, makes you want to scratch your own eyes out and at the same time, you feel sickenly sorry for him. it would have been a lot easier for me to simply walk out of ronald bronstein\\'s film, but for some insane reason, i felt an unwavering determination to stay the course and experience all the grainy irritation the film has to offer. if someone sets you on fire, you typically want to put it out: stop! drop! and roll! but with this film, you want to watch the flame slowly engulf your entire body. you endure the pain--perhaps out of spite, or some unknown masochistic curiosity i can\\'t even begin to attempt to explain. unfortunately, mainstream cinema will never let this film come to a theater near you. but if you get a chance to catch it, prepare yourself: bring a doggie bag. i saw this movie while surfing through infomercials and late-night 80\\'s sitcoms on tv one night at 2 in the morning. i must say, i didn\\'t expect much, and i didn\\'t get much. although rose mcgowan is hot, her performance and the performance of the rest of the cast was not oscar-worthy, to say the least. this movie has its ups and downs, and does have a nice couple of twists at the end, but in all honesty it was awful. not even a typical slasher movie. no gore, no sex, no nudity, no real violence. just bad acting. i\\'d give it a 3 out of 10. i first saw this film when i was about 8 years old on tv in the uk (where it was called \"laupta: the flying island\"). i absolutely loved it, and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and i missed it. i was enchanted by the story and characters, but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music. it would have been the original english dubbed version which i saw - sometimes erroneously referred to as the \"streamline dub\" (the dub was actually by ghibli themselves and only distributed by streamline) which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box-set. unfortunately i feel that the release has been partly spoiled by disney. the voice acting is ok but the dialogue doesn\\'t have the same raw energy that the \"streamline\" dub or the original japanese had, and i think james van der beek sounds too old to play the lead. they have made some pointless alterations, such as changing the main character\\'s name from \"pazu\" to \"patzu\", and added some dialogue. but worst of all i feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music - the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to disney\\'s moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking, which i find annoying in many disney films. this film still blows away most recent animated films, and i cannot recommend it highly enough. the plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass-market, homogenized animation. this film can\\'t make up its mind whether its message is \"humans are evil and bad and animals are sweet and blameless\" or \"don\\'t ever go in the water again.\" a fisherman (nolan) is out to nab a killer whale, a very bad thing, but when he accidentally (accidentally mark you) hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate, the cow -- and i use the word in all senses -- who is obviously a sick psycho-bitch and the canonical villain of the piece -- throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself. (i doubt it was her first.) when her unborn fetus aborts from her hideous self-inflicted wounds, her mate goes mental with revenge and swears to hurt, kill and mutilate every human who even so much as talks to nolan. obviously as among humans, total psychos date other total psychos. the film reeks of half-thought out anti-human message, \"the poor poor whale!! the evil men must suffer and die!\" and yet, it does not succeed in demonizing nolan at all. it\\'s true that when he set out his motives were selfish and cruel, but at the first squeal of the first whale he grows a heart and, as the film progresses, he grows more and more compassionate to the whale\\'s pain until it seems he will walk out on the ice and give himself to the whale, just to make it feel a little better. the films final journey, in which nolan follows the whale on a bizarre journey to the north, reminds me of melville\\'s eerie man-whale connection, and for a moment hinted at a truly interesting conclusion, where these two husbands might connect, understand even respect each other in their own grief, for nolan lost his wife and unborn child also to an accident. it\\'s clear nolan respects the whale and feels for its loss. however, it never goes there. the whale-character has no compassion or respect for anyone. the final scene loses this focus and becomes jaws-like where the sea-monster finally kills everybody and nolan and no-doubt through an oversight, fails to chomp up the whale-hugger (tho he made a good snap for her head a little earlier.) i love animals, and i detest whaling, and what is more i love orca whales, but if this film\\'s goal was to make me feel that the whale was the victim and that people are evil and detestable it completely failed. nolan shows compassion and growth, and feels for others, and all the whale thinks about is killing and maiming. the only message one can walk away with is \"if you see an orca whale, ever, anywhere, run the other way cause if you step on his fin the wrong way, he will hunt you to the ends of the earth destroying everything around you.\" why, o\\' why! ...did i pick this one up? well... i needed a no-brainer in the summer heat, and the cover looked cool. of course i should\\'ve known better. this is a really, really bad movie. and it gets embarasing when the makers know it\\'s bad, and try cover it up by adding some sexy/beautiful women, and some sex-scenes to it. well, folks... it does\\'nt cut it, does it! if you would like a cool movie about a big reptile that is actually very, very good, well-played and funny: go rent lake placid! (that is an order) only a very small child could overlook the absurdities in this bomb; the first difficulty faced by the submarine \"seaview\" is what appear to be chunks of--rock? falling down through the water and crashing into its hull. but it\\'s not rock, they\\'re under the north pole--it is ice! everybody, except possibly hitherto mentioned small children (and even some of them) know that ice floats. then, disaster strikes--that darn van allen radiation belt around the earth catches fire! no one knows how this happened, we are told, which is understandable, because it is utterly impossible for radiation to \"catch fire\", and even if it could, there is no air in space for it to burn. there is literally no good reason to overlook science concepts basic to 2nd grade school textbooks when making a film; however, irwin allen manages to do it again and again; perhaps we are meant to focus on the \"people\" instead, which is pretty easy, as they are cardboard. the cast tries very hard not to look embarrassed in this ridiculous sub-kiddie romp, much like later episodes of his \"lost in space\" tv series, the concept of which was swiped outright from writer ib melchior and then rushed into production. the sub looks pretty good, though, which is why this one gets a \"2\". our teacher showed us this movie in first grade. i haven\\'t seen it since. i just watched the trailer though. does this look like a first grade movie to you? i don\\'t think so. i was so horrified by this movie, i could barely watch it. it was mainly the scene with shirley mcclain cutting that little girl in half, and then there was the boy with ketchup! i was freaked out by this film. now today, being 20, i probably would not feel that way. i just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldn\\'t see this movie, even though it\\'s pg. be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids. i don\\'t even remember what it was about, once was enough! a plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side pro-life and the other a destroyer of a demon\\'s seed. the horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific, but, instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death, despite the title itself. being a fan of masters of horror since the beginning, this ridiculous plot twist with it\\'s sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon. i view this episode as being thrown together from the get go, never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to \"the end\".. scott menville is not casey kasem. that is the first, most important, and most disturbing thing about this attempt at re-imagining scooby-doo and company. shaggy\\'s voice is squeaky and does not sound anything like he has ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the scooby shows. they\\'ve also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the original. i\\'m not sure what they\\'re on about yet with the villain angle, but it surely isn\\'t following the formula used in any of the previous scooby shows. and the animation style is very bizarre and distorted. i like it, but it\\'s not real scooby-doo type animation. but the weird animation used for other wb shows grew on me; this might, too. it\\'s worth a glance at -- once -- if you can handle the lack of proper shaggy voice. that right there is enough to jar one out of enjoying the show properly. besides, i am trying not to be an inflexible, nitpicking fan. evolve or die, as the saying goes. we\\'ll see how it looks after two more episodes -- by then i\\'ll have formed a much more solid opinion. i often wonder how movies like this even get made, and the most shocking part is that people actually pay to watch them. with aksar it appears as though the director made up the story as he went along, adding twists and turns when he liked, no matter how ludicrous they were. the script was non existent with inane dialogs such as \"jo sheena roy pehenti hai, wahee fashion hota hai\" and \"yeh versace hai madam\" (yeah right). every one of the characters was shallow and underdeveloped. acting was awful. constumes (lycra for udita and awful suits for a stocky emran), locales (the numerous houses that were used for interiors did not even vaguely resemble a victorian mansion), screenplay etc etc, just one word- rubbish. for those people who love hashmi and his movies, watch it. as for me, i\\'ll never get those two and a half hours back. the only redeeming factor was some of the music which was decent. this movie is an amazing comedy.. the script is too funny.. if u watch it more than once you will enjoy it more. though the comedy at times is silly but it really makes u laugh!! salman khan and aamir khan have given justice to their roles. after 1994 i have not come across any hindi movie which was as funny as this. even this early in his career, capra was quite accomplished with his camera-work and his timing. this is a thin story -- and quite predictable at times -- but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately. the first part looks like a cinderella story, though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that -- the rich \\'prince\\' will lose his fortune. nonetheless, because of his good cast and fast pace, it\\'s easy to get caught up in the clichã©s. then the movie does become more original, as the married couple have to find a way to make a living. the ending is very predictable but satisfying. i also want to compliment the title-writing: very witty and fun. uwe boll slips back in his film-making skills once again to offer up a scifi horror tale of mercenaries and reporters taking on super soldiers on a remote island. an okay cast headed by the excellent udo keir is cast adrift by boll who makes the worst of script that should have worked. the mad scientist being investigated by a reporter has been done to death but this script is amusing enough that the plot should have worked, additionally the effects and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eyes have some degree of creepiness, however boll somehow manages to film everything in an off handed way. its as if he couldn\\'t be bothered to actually figure out what would work and instead rattled off stock camera placements and walked away. additionally the assembly of scenes has no spark or life, i\\'m guessing that boll only shot one or two takes and just used what he had. it really stinks. clearly boll is in one of his periodic retrograde films where anything he\\'s ever learned about film gets flushed. the last film he made that was this bad was seed a serial killer movie that is one of the worst films i\\'ve ever seen. this isn\\'t that bad, but it is close simply because it should have been better. then again udo keir is good enough that he does make watching his scenes worth the effort and make this a an almost so bad its good film. i\\'d take a pass unless it\\'s late at night and you\\'re catching it on cable. this video is so hilariously funny, it makes everything else by eddie murphy seem very disappointing (even beverly hills cop and the nutty professor, which just goes to show you how good this really is). to be honest, i don\\'t think that i\\'ve ever laughed at something as much as this, including naked gun and the rarely seen bargearse. this show is amazing, although it must be said that it is certainly filled with the word beginning with f that is four letters long (plus its extended version beginning with m) but it didn\\'t bother me. see it, the funniest thing i\\'ve ever seen and probably the funniest you ever have too. this film is dreadful. it has absolutely zero laughs. hebrew hammer (adam goldberg) sets out to save hannukah from evil santa (andy dick). perhaps a promising enough basis for a plot, in actual fact the film does not progress beyond this premise. while there are some (far and few) nice touches and the plot is relatively coherent, it is laboured, hackneyed and ultimately, mindlessly boring. this despite the fact that goldberg, dick and greer (hammer\\'s client/love interest) all have quite considerable screen presence. despite being played for what might be described as whacky over-the-top gags, this film is consistently middle-class middle-of-the-road muck. do not waste 85 minutes of your life on this. (note- the music was good..!) it\\'s amazing that such a cliche-ridden yuppie angst film actually got made in the first place. the characters are so weak, and the acting so uninspired, that it\\'s impossible to care about any of them-- especially brooke shields. the temptation to fast forward through the slow parts is almost irresistible. if you like this genre, you\\'d be better off renting \"singles,\" or \"bodies, rest & motion.\" i never watched the \\'next action hero\\' show, and until reading the other comments here, did not know that this movie was the \\'prize\\' from that competition. i was just flipping channels and came across this, and found myself watching, dare eagerly, all the way to the end. yes, the plot\\'s been done (the most dangerous game, etc.) but i was hoping for, and almost received, the \\'gotcha\\' - how the protagonist was going to beat the hunter in the end. i think the high-tech was overdone (gps\\'s) and gave me cold-sweat flashbacks of night rider, but it nevertheless was not too overdone. the basic problem i had with this movie was the degree of sod (suspension of disbelief) that was required of the viewer. do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could lob countless incendiary grenades at a public bridge and no cops show up to investigate? could a limousine do countless donuts in a las vegas intersection and no cops show up? pleeease. way too much of that type of thing - fun to watch, but keep it at least plausible, thank you very much. the final solution was good, but the ending was disappointing, with the after taste of a bad star trek episode. at least now i understand why the acting was so cheesy - except for zane, who doesn\\'t get near as much work as he deserves imho - they were winners from a reality show. knock me out. i am a big fan of old horror movies, and since i am middle aged, old to me is a movie made before 1970 with most being made in the 1920\\'s to 1960\\'s period. i am not a big fan of more modern horror movies, with one exception being creepshow 1, which i thought was great. i could reminisce about the stories there but i really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with hal holbrook, and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending. all the stories were great though. so why did i like them so much? the characters had some decent development, the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad, the horror bits were heightened with a close up of a face aghast with fear, and the funny bits were really funny! this sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent! i am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and i turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on imdb.com, lol. when george kennedy and an old dorothy lamoure get top billing it\\'s telling you something.....4 of 10. also, romero\\'s expertise is hard to find here, they must had told him to tone it down to a pg standard (i don\\'t know what this was rated at but it looks pg to me), and that\\'s not a good thing for a movie with nothing else going on. it\\'s shown on the encore cable channel if your dieing (yuck yuck) to see it. i just wanted to say that. i love gheorghe muresan, so i automatically loved this movie. everything else about it was so-so... billy crystal is a good actor, even if he is annoying. but the thing that made this movie was- at least, for a basketball fan- seeing gheorghe muresan act. i thought that this movie was incredible. i absolutely loved it, even though my brothers didn\\'t that much. the special effects were outstanding, and this movie is about my favorite sport; golf. the only thing that was disappointing about this amazing movie is that it is hard to watch two times or more in a row. this movie just absolutely tops everything else i have ever seen. it was everything i would expect out of a movie. i just loved it. also, it was pretty kid-friendly. this movie helped me realize that when you put your mind to it, anything is possible. i would give it a pure 10/10! it was better than the legend of baggar vants, and the two pirates of the caribbean movies combined. absolutely amazing. loved it. this is a funny film and i like it a lot. cary elwes plays robin hood to a tee. this is, of course, the usual good vs evil with robin against the evil sheriff of nottingham. the humor is sort of in your face stuff for the most part, but still works well. a comedy for a night when you don\\'t want to have to think much, it\\'s well worth a rent! some here have commented that this is the worst elvis movie ever made. well, they are only partly right. for me, this is the worst movie ever made period! i have never seen anything so basely crude, and insulting, and vile, and against human nature as this film. a true embarrassment to the motion picture industry, this isn\\'t even so bad, its good. there is no campy trashy fun to be had here like in some of elvis\\' other bad movies like clambake. this one is so rotten to sit through its painful. pure garbage. native americans should sue for their poor clichã©d and stereotypical treatment here. actually, perhaps all human beings should sue for the crime and disservice this movie does to the species as a whole 0 stars, seriously. grade: f first of all yes i\\'m white, so i try to tread lightly in the ever delicate subject of race... anyway... white people hating black people = bad but black people hating white people = ok (because apparently we deserved it!!). where do i start? i wish i had something good to say about this movie aside unintended comedy scenes: the infamous scene were ice cube and co. get in a fight with some really big, really strong, really really angry and scary looking neo-nazis and win!!! the neo-nazi where twice the size :), and the chase! the chase is priceless... this is not a movie about race, tolerance and understanding, it doesn\\'t deliver... this is a racist movie that re-affirm all the clichã© stereotypes, the white wimpy guy who gets manhandled by his black roommate automatically transform in a skinhead...cmon simply awful i do regret ever seeing it. save your time and the dreadful experience of a poorly written ,poorly acted, dull and clearly biased picture, if you are into the subject, go and rent american history x, now thats a movie donald pleasance and peter cushing united in one horror film; that always sounds like a terrific plan. two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation, who previously already starred together in terrific genre outings like \"the flesh and the fiends\" and \"from beyond the grave\", pairing up in a mid-70\\'s satanic themed exploitation flick. how can this possibly go wrong? well, unfortunately, it can. to my deepest regret \"land of the minotaur\" can hardly even be called mediocre, and that in spite of the cast, the exotic setting, the appealing title and the potentially great sounding premise. in a remote little area in greece, more particularly near an archaeological site, multiple tourists vanish because baron peter cushing and his docile followers keep feeding them to a fire-breathing minotaur statue. cushing, who never looked more bored and uninterested in any role he played before, owns a giant medieval castle and apparently in greek this means you also own the complementary archaeological ruins and an underground network of caverns. that is of course quite handy if your hobby is the kidnapping of random campers and amateur archaeologists. when three of his young friends also mysteriously disappear in the same area, father roch - the priest of a couple of towns before) - decides to investigate. \"land of the minotaur\" is a boring and extremely slow-paced horror effort that never really undertakes any major attempts to generate a satanic atmosphere and doesn\\'t bother to elaborate on all the potentially fascinating elements and pagan trivia details. the titular minotaur, for example, is an intriguing creature of greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person, but for some inexplicable reason the script never deepens out the significance. instead, the film focuses on tedious and overly talkative sequences and loud inappropriate music altered with experimental noises. the only reason to even consider giving this major disappointment of a film a chance is because of donald pleasance. his portrayal of rude, bossy and old-fashioned priest who criticizes everything that represents modern youth is powerful and reliable as always. the three shorts included on this compilation issued in 1959 are timeless chaplin classics, nothing wrong with them and nothing to criticize either. chaplin\\'s score for these films and the framework added as bridging sections between the shorts are also well done. the problem with this compilation is a minor one, yet annoying. the shorts have been stretch-printed to fit the 24 frame p.s. speed of contemporary films whereas the shorts themselves where shot at 20 frames p.s. this results is jerky motion that doesn\\'t look very attractive, and yet this was an excusable solution given the limitations of optical printing technology at the time, it\\'s just not excusable that the current dvd version is unrestored, the films look dirty as they did in 1959 and are still stretch printed. there are separate restored versions of these classics available, even on dvd, and it would not be a problem to restore the image, but alas this has not been done. a minor quibble has taken up a lot of space in my article, but i say again a minor quibble, it should not detract all that much from the experience although it detracted one point from my rating. the shorts are still worth \\'10\\'. 1979\\'s tourist trap is a clever, unique b thriller that stands out as one of the best of it\\'s kind. travellers stop at a lonely wax museum where the owner\\'s mannequins are a little too life-like for comfort. while the film has hints of the texas chainsaw massacre, tourist trap is mainly a creepy psychological thriller worthy of the twilight zone. director david schmoeller gives this movie an atmosphere of darkness and mystery, that reaches nightmarish proportions. also, schmoelloer adds the occasional touch of comic relief to the bizarre happenings. venteran actor chuck connors is the best of the film\\'s decent cast. pino donaggio\\'s music score is excellent, having both lyrical and solemn themes that are perfect to the movie. a number of the film\\'s sequences are quite memorable. for horror and thriller fans alike, tourist trap is an unforgettable must-see film. *** 1/2 out of **** years ago i saw the godfather and it made a lasting impression on me, the atmosphere of the movie was first class, the acting memorable and the storyline a classic. recently i bought the trilogy and after watching part 1 again i looked eagerly to viewing part 2...... i was so pleased to realize early on into part 2 that here was a fitting follow on to the great godfather movie, again everything was just about perfect and i could not wait to see godfather iii ........ wrong!, i wish i\\'d stopped at ii. the storyline was not good, it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story, the characters were weak especially the daughter. pacino\\'s protege was a weak character that would have been eaten alive in godfather 1 or 2. then scenes such as, corleone being invested with all the trappings of the catholic church with full choir, the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset, the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting (where the \\'goodies\\' get away and everyone else is shot),daughter and 1st cousin rolling bits of pasta across a board, the pathetic shooting on the steps ..... corleone stuffing sweets down him with orange juice for diabetes (a man of his intelligence and guile isn\\'t ready for an emergency?)... no it was not good and with the best will in the world i wont be able to watch it again. but i\\'ll watch 1 & 2 many times down the years. this little two-person movie is actually much bigger than it looks. it has so many layers. i\\'ve watched it over and over, and always pick up on something new. i am amazed at the depth of the acting, and i feel if this movie had gotten wider release that there would be no question that alan rickman is a major star uk newspaper reviews seem to have concentrated on the fact that the reviewers tend to know toby young, the journalist on whose real-life experiences this movie is based. the key word here is \"based\". how to lose friends is a fictitious romcom. sidney young joins a prestigious gossip magazine in new york, where he proceeds to make gaffe after gaffe before finally getting it right and making it. this involves him selling out, and the movie has some serious points to make about journalistic integrity. however, they are not overdone: the main substance remains a comedy which centres around sidney\\'s misadventures. the script has its cake and eats it in that sidney is a stupid, well-meaning buffoon at the same time as being a smart, moderately obnoxious skilled writer. this contradiction is never that much of an issue, because simon pegg (as sidney) projects likability too well. jeff bridges underplays sidney\\'s editor a little too effectively, and kirsten dunst is rather anonymous as the conflicted eventual object of sidney\\'s affections and, with regard to megan fox (who plays an airhead bimbo starlet), i can say only this: just say the word, miss fox, and i will leave my wife, sell all my belongings, and buy myself a plane ticket in order to take my place at your side as your consort. of course, given that i\\'m a fat 56-year-old english accountant, you might not find my offer too enticing, but it\\'s there on the table anyway. given how short her career has been so far, one might think it is a little too soon for megan fox to take on a role which mercilessly lampoons the sort of actress she might be thought to become: however, she does it sweetly, with some skill, and extremely sexily. this girl will go far. there is stalwart support from a variety of seasoned performers - miriam margolyes and bill paterson from the uk, gillian anderson and danny huston from the us. there are several laugh-out-loud moments, and i smiled most of the way through. as ever, the f-word makes appearances when it really doesn\\'t need to, although at least a couple of these are very funny. alien hunter: 5 out of 10: is it me or does every movie that starts in roswell, new mexico suck. take alien mixed with the thing, mixed with contact, mixed with of all things on the beach, the andromeda strain, the classroom scene from raiders of the lost ark and a throw in a little stargate to boot. derivative doesn\\'t even begin to describe this movie. of course with nothing original plot wise they amp up the gore and sex right? nope gore is a blink and you miss it affair and sex is all tease. (james spader causally mentions he needs a shower and the delectable leslie stefanson asks to join himâ…. he turns her down. aggh!) in fact if a movie ever needed a shower scene to liven things up this is it. i mean if your going to have impossibly good-looking women in white bathing suits wandering around an antarctica research base why not go for broke. with about 30 seconds of actual thrill in the entire movie alien hunter is remarkable serious and slow going for a sci-fi adventure. needed a much better plot twist to liven it up and by the way the alien itself is a horribly clichã©d artifice and has virtually no screen time for someone who shares half the title. i also inquired during viewing what is with the children of the corn in space motif. (note that since jason of friday the 13th fame, pinhead from hellraiser and that leprechaun have all traveled to space to slay nubile teenagers why not the cornfield?) the characters in the cornfield dress like logan\\'s run extras and i was just waiting for the stalks to come alive and attack them. that however would have been exciting and apparently against this movies covenant. the acting is mostly fine as spader reprises his stargate role while stefanson and janine eser model the latest in antarctic beachwear. john lynch however read the whole script and acts the like the insane bad guy well before the story would indicate it. alien hunter is a disappointing derivative slog that makes me pine for a proper children of the corn in space movie. i have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was. once in a while you see a film that just sticks with you. \"you are alone\" is that movie (for me). the film is constantly in my head and in my heart. i replay the scenes mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotions all over again, as if i am seeing it for the first time. there is nothing i did not like about the movie. amazing soundtrack!!! the ending was perfect. very emotionally stirring!!! it was compelling and riveting. i adored jessica bohl and her performance was the greatest i have ever witnessed. i admired brittany\\'s strength (what a strong woman). the tag line is \"when your darkest moments come to life\". we never know what we are capable of doing. everyone says oh i would never do that, when really we have no idea what we would do in a situation. we are very capable of anything and this movies delves straight into that subject. the honesty of the movie may be my absolute favorite part. thank you gorman becherd for a perfect piece of art!!!! i love this young people trapped in a house of horrors movie. not just because i\\'m a huge linnea quigley-jill terashita fan, but because it is a lot of fun and actually scary at times. the special effects are awesome, especially linnea\\'s scene with the lipstick and towards the end when almost everyone is dead and possessed. plenty of nudity provided by linnea and jill, plenty of humor, cool soundtrack, high body count, etc...by the way, if you have never seen this one, try and buy/watch the unrated version which has more gore and some scenes the rated version is missing. i saw the film and i got screwed, because the film was foolish and boring. i thought ram gopal varma will justify his work but unfortunately he failed and the whole film got spoiled and they spoiled \"sholay\". the cast and crew was bad. the whole theater slept while watching the movie some people ran away in the middle. amithab bachan\\'s acting is poor, i thought this movie will be greatest hit of the year but this film will be the greatest flop of the year,sure. nobody did justice to their work, including ajay devagan. this film don\\'t deserve any audiences. i bet that this film will flop. \"finally this movie sucks\" lorna green(janine reynaud)is a performance artist for wealthy intellectuals at a local club. she falls prey to her fantasies as the promise of romantic interludes turn into murder as she kills those who believe that sex is on the horizon. it\\'s quite possible that, through a form of hypnotic suggestion, someone(..a possible task master pulling her strings like a puppet)is guiding lorna into killing those she comes across in secluded places just when it appears that love-making is about to begin. after the murders within her fantasies are committed, lorna awakens bewildered, often clueless as to if what she was privy to within her dreams ever took place in reality. if someone asked me how to describe this particular work from franco, i\\'d say it\\'s elegant & difficult. by now, you\\'ve probably read other user comments befuddled by what this film is about, since a large portion of it takes place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream. franco mentioned in an interview that he was heavily influenced by godard early in his career, as far as film-making style, and so deciding to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of trying to create a whole different type of viewing experience. and, as you read from the reaction of the user comments here..some like this decision, others find the style labouring, dull, and bewildering. i\\'ll be the first to admit that the film is over my head, but even franco himself, when quizzed by critics who watched \"succubus\", admitted that he didn\\'t even understand the film and he directed it! some might say that \"succubus\" was merely a precursor to his more admired work, \"venus in furs\", considered his masterwork by franco-faithful, because it also adopts the surreal, dreamlike structure where the protagonist doesn\\'t truly know whether he/she is experiencing something real or imagined. in a sense, like the protagonist, we are experiencing the same type of confusion..certainly, \"succubus\" is unconventional film-making where we aren\\'t given the keys to what is exactly going on. and, a great deal of the elusive dialogue doesn\\'t help matters. \"succubus\" is also populated by beatnik types and \"poet-speak\", corman\\'s film, \"a bucket of blood\" poked fun at. my personal favorite scene teases at a possible lesbian interlude between lorna and a woman she meets at a posh party..quite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequins are used rather unusually. great locations and jazz score..i liked this film myself, although i can understand why it does receive a negative reaction. loved that one scene at the posh party with lorna, a wee bit drunk, writhing on the floor in a gorgeous evening gown as others attending the shindig(..equally wasted)rush her in an embrace of kisses. this outing of knotts includes one of his best sidekicks ever, frank welker. welker makes the film. knotts and welker compete for the laughs and both receive plenty. knotts works for a small \"no where\" town where the city is being run by some of the most ignorant officials. when things go wrong the city fathers, allow knotts to take the fall. frank welker\\'s character befriends knotts and together they stumble together to clear up the mess and knott\\'s good name. this film shows the usual knott\\'s scared to death character that made him famous for years on television and film. this may have been knotts\\' last good outing. when you have an extra 90 minutes, get a good old fashioned laugh a great icon, don knotts. emma is a horribly flawed film based on jane austens classic novel. i have not read the book so i really didn\\'t know that much about the plot, and yet i still predicted nearly the entire plot. there were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing. the film is though for some reason very entertaining and i loved it. of course there were all the scenes i disliked but the majority was well acted and funny. gwyneth paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in emma. the film also stars toni collette(who has okay but has been much better) ewan mecgreger(who has also been better but he is still very good here) alan cumming(who i have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here) and jeremy northam(who\\'s performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle, even if that was not what it needed) there have been much better adaptations of jane austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching. why do i hate this? let me list the ways: i have nothing against mary pickford but a 32 year old woman playing a 12 year old is just stupid. there\\'s a fight scene in which kids are throwing bricks at each other and it\\'s considered funny---and it goes on for 15 minutes strange how none of the kids are even remotely hurt the title cards contain plenty of racial and ethnic slurs for a \"family\" film the fights were way too violent (loved it when pickford was punching it out with a little boy!) and the humor was just stupid seriously, 40 minutes in i gave up and turned it off. the slurs, racism and little kids throwing bricks at each other got to me. also there was no plot that i could see. the only thing worth seeing in this film was william haines who was a top leading man in the silent era. just painful. avoid. thank god this wasn\\'t based on a true story, because what a story it is. populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds, before the devil is a mesmerizing, jaw-dropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable (and sometimes is, even with - or perhaps because of - the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout) if it weren\\'t carried out with such magnificent, overwhelming conviction by its stars. the excellent script by kelly masterson and superb direction by none other than sidney lumet doesn\\'t hurt either. the main dysfunction here is of a family nature, with the two majorly screwed up brothers (brilliant portrayals from philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke) deciding to rob their own parents\\' jewelry store, an attempt that goes pathetically awry. the story is told with time-shifts (which are noted on screen, such as: \"charlie: two days before the robbery\", so no one should be confused); some people have said they didn\\'t like this device but i thought it worked perfectly, adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair, considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full decks - between them you couldn\\'t make a decent poker hand to save your life. throw in these cheesy extra tidbits: one of the brothers is a drug addict, married to gina (marisa tomei, also excellent), who is having an affair with the other brother, toss in some monumental sibling rivalry, along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father (a wrenching performance from albert finney), who has apparently caused him serious past pain, and you\\'ve got a shakespearean/greek tragedy on your hands. proceed with caution. if you want just about everything you want to know about wwii from multiple perspectives, this dvd delivers, you will learn new things guaranteed, so much so that you won\\'t need any other documentary\\'s on the subject. get this, watch it, learn from it. good for school use as well. as a bonus, watch this with tora tora tora, saving private ryan, patton, band of brothers, a bridge too far, the longest day and other wwii epics along with this to make your knowledge of wwii even more complete. sir laurence oliver\\'s voice adds to the overall atmosphere of each episode in this 26 part series. seriously you won\\'t find a better wwii documentary set on the subject. perfect 10!!! the movie was gripping from start to finish and its b/w photography of the american heartland is stunning. we feel we are right there with them as they cross the big sky country and then into mexico and back to america again. near the end of the movie, the reflection of the rain on robert blake looks like small rivers of sweat and tears rolling down his face. in the end, we follow them up the stairway to their final moment. the two criminals, performed by robert blake and scott wilson, as perry smith and dick hickock could be seen on any street in any town. hickock is a smiling boy next door and smith, the guy with stars in his eyes from the wrong side of town. this point is made in the movie and it always surprises us that criminals are no different in appearance than anyone else. evil, even the most vile, is part of the human condition. these two delusional men kill an entire family, looking for a safe that isn\\'t there. once on the run, they start writing bad cheques, carving out a trail for the authorities. there are many fine supporting actors. i like john forsyth as the detective on the case, alvin dewey. also, will geer shines in a brief but excellent scene as the prosecuting attorney. i have often wanted to see this movie all the way through, having only caught it in short snatches; i did finally get to it after buying the dvd. the result is the finest classic crime movie i have ever seen. don\\'t miss this brilliant movie. to me, this is what great film-making is all about. this is a great show with total freshness and innovation. that usual chair (couch for a woman) host, that mandatory band playing monotonous tunes, the same old jokes, the same pattern copied from the days of nebuchadnezzer ....probably the pattern of johnny carson, copied by one and all, latterman, leno, conan... daly, this show does not seem to have any of these. i fell in love with this show within the first 10 minutes and i am going to stick to it. though it\\'s too early to say that, this show seems to be devoid of any intellectual pretension most talk shows try so hard to project, and i hope that that is what would make this show different from all the rest. i hope that this show will last long! returning back after months, i still love this show, and i love his self-deprecating humor (for example, his affirmation that only pothead loners would be home to watch his show at saturday midnight and thus, the jokes are funny only to the stoned guys) which, however, does not involve the usual monkeying of conan o\\'brien, for example (i know it\\'s a cardinal sin to be repelled by o\\'brien\\'s antics; but i do really dislike his style and repetitiveness). i again watched it the other night with tom arnold in it. ferensen\\'s spoof of trading spouses (and nanny 911 in an earlier episode) are hilarious. idiot paparazzi are fun, especially when a security guard cautions them against taking people\\'s pictures, and (if i am not mistaken) they start taking his pictures shouting \"gary coleman\". added on 16th april, 2007: coming back once again, i am left confused by the neighbor and her dog. i cannot decide if it is a joke or a real thing. either way, it was funny as hell. i do not expect spike feresten to read these pages, but maybe he does. he is crazier than a bunch of monkeys and so, i would better write down my suggestion here for him: i would like him to do a full 30 minute show with crazy gideon, the star of late night tv commercial. i would like crazy gideon to have an interview in spike\\'s talk show, sing a song (and play guitar), do a skit in the line of snl, and also to answer questions from the audience regarding his potential mayorship of los angeles (i know, crazy gideon may not be aware of this, but there are websites detailing why he would be the perfect candidate for the post of the mayor of la). god willing! returning back on 14th july, 2007: someone wrote here that the people who praised spike\\'s talkshow must be bribed by spike. i confess that spike really bribed me, but i must also confess that rockefeller named me in his will and last night i had sex with cindy crowford. it\\'s all about getting what you want when you want it. and the message of bluebeard\\'s eighth wife is to be careful what you wish for, until what you wish for wishes for you. most men have heard the stories about what happens when your sexual frustration isn\\'t relieved and a certain part of your anatomy turning blue. misogynistic pirates aside, cooper plays a very wealthy man who is very accustomed to getting what he wants whenever he wants it, learning only too late that it wasn\\'t what he expected and never learning his lesson until he runs into the feisty claudette colbert. through a twisted (in soul and in practice) business deal, he ends up marring/buying her with the intent of bedding her, but she will have none of it (literally) and frustrates him at every turn, and corner, and room, and tourist attraction. the film has definite french sensibilities which means it has strong double-entendres and boudoir humor for the day and a sharp edge you\\'re not accustomed to (and may not enjoy seeing) in either cooper or colbert. the whole reason i watched the film was because they are \"likable\" actors, and the whole point of this movie is that they\\'re unlikable people, or at least likable people who have developed unlikable traits to protect themselves, they think, from the world. if you can accept it on its own terms you\\'ll find satisfaction in this witty and sophisticated film...and satisfaction, as we said, is what it\\'s all about. such a movie with such a cast only comes around, after all, once in a...ummm...blue moon. now i have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly i\\'m appalled. for anyone to even think that the sopranos is not television then i\\'m afraid i don\\'t know what the world has come to. let me tell u something. i started watching many t.v shows like lost, prison break, dexter, deadwood and even invasion. but all of those shows lost their touch after the first season, especially lost and prison break which i refuse to watch because the companies took 2 genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season. then we have the sopranos. i can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season, and more importantly all of its episodes. there is no department that this show doesn\\'t excel in. acting- nothing short of superb. james gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode, after i heard that hbo wanted ray liotta to play tony i felt that it would\\'ve been the better choice, however after watching the first few episodes, i knew that hbo had done a great job in casting james as tony. the raw emotion he displays is superb. then we have everyone else, edie falco, michael imperioli, lorraine bracco, dominic chianese (whom i remembered as johnny ola in the godfather part 2) and my personal two favourite characters tony sirico and steve van zandt paulie \\'walnuts\\' gualtieri and silvio dante. all of these actors perform to the best quality, and all giving an excellent performance in each episode. then we have the story, never have i been so sucked into a t.v show before. the story is nothing short of excellent. each episode is directed superbly and the score of this show is just fantastic. i feel that the sopranos is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bored of. its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence, but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the television, and i challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show. not just say its too violent, or they feel that the character of tony is immoral, i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day, i don\\'t think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to god. i implore everyone to watch this show because believe me, you\\'ll be hooked from the very first episode, i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show, hooked on it. trust me when i say that this show is a godsend compared to the crap that comes on t.v. after you\\'ve watched the first season, you\\'ll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates television, and no t.v show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is the sopranos. i\\'d give this a negative rating if i could. i went into this movie not expecting much, but i had an open mind. the whole thing is stupid! the snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson. oh how original; if i were a 12 year old boy i might laugh at that. i have no idea how this movie became so popular. seriously,the worst thing i\\'ve ever seen. i wasn\\'t entertained, it wasn\\'t funny,i wasn\\'t even bored! i wasn\\'t anything. it wasn\\'t even so bad it was good, it\\'s just bad. ridiculous actually. please do not waste your money on this movie. don\\'t even rent this movie. no clue how it\\'s getting such a high rating. most people are totally unaware that this movie exists. fox, which paid judge to make it, has kept it in the can for quite awhile and then spent nothing to promote it. i guess that made many people think it was one of the garbage movies being flushed in late summer. well, i am here to tell you that this is a funny and rather frightening look at a future that is not that hard to believe. basically, judge puts forward the notion that the stupid are outbreeding the smart by a wide margin. then these stupid are getting more stupid, by basically spending all of their time watching tv and having sex, which produces more stupid people. by 2500, a person of average intelligence today, will appear to be a genius, that talks \"all faggy.\" seriously, is this really that hard to believe. oh sure, this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid, but still plausible. luke wilson is great as the time traveling army guy, hopelessly trying to get back to a more comfortable time. where this story will gain its cult status is with the numerous funny one-liners, like \"can we family style her\" and \"hey man, i\\'m \\'bating here!\" this is a funny movie and a rather sharp social commentary on an american society that seems to be fatuated with self pleasure, comfort and stupidity, and i guarantee you that i will be buying this on dvd the first day it comes out and watching it over and over. this is a great, ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late 80s\\' obsession with how evil metal music supposedly was. i can remember being freaked out by metal teens when i was a kid. it doesn\\'t help that i found a desecrated grave in my hometown\\'s graveyard when i was ten. turns out this weird metal kid had dug up some old bodies and used their bones in some weird sacrifice to satan. so maybe stuff like deterred me from metal for awhile, but i love it now, as a 24 year old. i bought this dvd used for 6 bucks and i expected it to suck due to the lame cover, but to my surprise, it ruled. it is all about the extreme demonic power of metal. and you gotta love a scene where a guitar shoots lazers and vaporizes headbangers in the crowd. this movie is awesome, if you love 80s metal and bad movies, this one\\'s for you. 9/10! while not quite as good as a murder is announced, which was not only delightful but almost surpassed the book, this is an excellent adaptation. and you know what, it is a huge improvement on the geraldine mcewan version. now i don\\'t take pride in bad mouthing the geraldine mcewan adaptations, two or three of them were surprisingly good, but others started off well but ruined by either a poor script, a confusing final solution or both. the geraldine mcewan version suffered from a plodding pace, and both of the above problems, and i would consider second worst of the itv adaptations, worst being sittaford mystery, which even on its own merits turned out dull and confusing. this adaptation of the book nemesis is a huge improvement, it not only respects the book, despite a few liberties, but it pretty much rectifies the problems the itv version had. despite the added character of lionel coming across as rather irritating, more to do with how he was written than how he was acted, and one or two moments of sluggish pacing, this is solid as an adaptation of a decent book. it is beautifully filmed, with nice photography and period detail, and the music as always is excellent. the performances are wonderful this time around, and make the most of an in general well-done script, with joan hickson brilliant as always as miss marple, and solid turns from liz fraser, helen cherry, joanna hole and anna cropper. margaret tyzack is outstanding though in a chilling and moving performance as clothilde. overall, well worth watching, better than the recent version in pretty much all departments. 9/10 bethany cox good lord, what were they thinking??!!!!!! here is your spoiler warning, even though i don\\'t think it\\'ll really matter. you won\\'t be seeing this piece of trash anyway. a group of handpuppets go chasing after a group of really stupid people, who go on a really stupid hunt for them to try and kill them, and the puppets complicate things by letting them live out their really stupid fantasies. in other words, the whole thing is really stupid. you know it has to be bad when even mike and the bots can\\'t save something!! and they didn\\'t! i know, some of their lines were funny, like what to add to the sign \"hit\" and the hand comments, but, geez, this was pretty dang sad. all i can say is do not watch this piece o crud. it is not worth your eyes. i had heard (and read) so many good things about weeds that i was looking forward to getting hooked on another great cable series (like entourage, sopranos or mad men) but that slowly eroded away with each episode i watched from season one. (didn\\'t make it past the first six episodes) the writing was unoriginal, contrived and the portrayal of blacks embarrassing. the dialog felt forced, like the writers are trying way too hard to be clever and hip . it was a rare moment when i actually emitted an audible laugh. the characters never developed enough for me to care about them, they were selfish and unappealing. i absolutely hated the addition of the brother-in-law (who should have been hauled away on to catch a predator) and the removal of the hodes\\' daughter quinn from the cast by sending her to boarding school in mexico was so unoriginal and clichã©, i had to conclude the writers were testing the viewer\\'s loyalty. episode after episode i liked the characters less and couldn\\'t get past many of the technical flaws in the story line. add to that i heard that season two wasn\\'t as good, so i lost all motivation to continue to watch this play out. if you\\'re a fan of good casting and writing, i suspect this show will be a challenge for you to like, unless of course you\\'re stoned and then all bets are off. this movie is among my favorite foreign films, some of the others are amilee and my life as a dog. the similarities with those movies as with so many great foreign films, is that it takes a mundane slice of life and transforms it into a profound heartfelt lesson. in japan, a man who is bored with his mundane life and the rut of his married life, sees a beautiful japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio. in the instant that it takes his train to pass, he is enthralled by her. but is it only by her beauty, by her faraway glance, or a connection that they will both discover that they share? shall we dance has memorable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them through the world of dance. breaking traditional moulds and stereo types of japanese society, they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away. it is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful and, in itself, transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be. as if the film were not of value in itself, this is an excellent way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to reading it. in the summer of 1968 i saw the film in nyc; that fall in graduate school, i read the book for the first time. some of the pleasure in reading the novel was my memory of the scrupulously detailed film. and for better or worse--and i\\'ve now read and taught the novel for over three decades--milo o\\'shea is still leopold bloom. this film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes an eleven year old boy living in a rural cuban town the year of the castro revolution. it is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love. the names cuba libre and cuban blood are merely attempts to wrongly market this as an action film. dreaming of julia makes much more sense. it has more in common with european cinema than with rambo and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to people\\'s daily lives and pursuits. that fact alone makes the film more honest than most works dealing with this time period in cuban history. the excessive use of the voice-over narrator does undermine the story but the film makes up for it with unqualified clips from hollywood films that say so much more visually than the narrator could. the comparisons to cinema paradiso and are fair game as the film does wax melancholy about movies, but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love. the revolution, like the film julie, never seems to have an ending. i saw zp when it was first released and found it a major disappointment. its script seemed forced and arch and too fakey \\'60s. it\\'s politics too upfront and ridiculous. and let\\'s face it, i was still under a love-spell known as blowup : and i still haven\\'t completely shaken it. now the \"love\" is twisted up with all sorts of nostalgia it evokes and, oh well . . . good luck to me! but time marches on and time has been kind to zp and time has been a teacher to me. i revisit this film about every ten years and it just gets better and better with age. and zp is it\\'s own \"experience\"and is only really linked to blowup through its creator, the late,great mr. antonioni. twelve years ago, i had the great good fortune to see an absolutely pristine print, projected at its correct size (immense), restored by an italian government cultural agency who knows a good work of art when they see it and knows the importance of keeping such a thing of beauty in good shape. to this day i remember the gasp from the audience when the first shot of death valley appeared. it was like a thousand volt visual shock antonioni had intentionally delivered to wake us up to a new level of awareness. and indeed what follows from that point is an entirely different sort of \"place\". what is astonishing to me is how this film is coming into its own. i remember the second time around seeing it --- the early 80s --- i had begun to feel affection towards the film as a whole and towards daria and mark in particular. whereas, before these two seemed like a smart-alecky shadow version of zefferelli\\'s olivia and leonard (read: romeo and juliet)they now were engaging me --- particularly the girl in her insistent slo-motion-ality. she-took-her-time . . . to live. everything, everything dies around her. upon exciting the theater the daylight of reality quickly began to erase my new found \"enjoyment\". the encroaching shoulder-padded, big haired 80s whispered \"but that\\'s a hippie fantasy --- let it go\" the force of antonioni\\'s vision had, i had realised, already worked itself inside of me the first time around so i answered \"80s\" with an \"uh-huh\" and guarded my \"love\" secretly, possessively and jealously. but, this, then is what good art does it lives inside of you, and, if you wish it has its way and \"loves\" you back: secretly, jealously, and possessively. and you get \"changed\". was thrilled to see that turner classic movies had decided to show zp in its march lineup. undoubtedly, zp must be seen on a gigantic screen so that it can truly take you into its constructed environment. but, hey, sometimes even a glimpse of the beloved in a newspaper photo is no better than no glimpse at all. today reality hit, zp has been withdrawn mysteriously and replaced with the whiney antics of alice\\'s restaurant. so, it is still too \"difficult\", too \"disturbing\", too \"what\"? maybe it\\'s that, as with all good art, it lives while everything dies around it. peace. very strange but occasionally elegant exploitation movie with no real story, but benefiting from its stunningly ravishing lead actress and a handful of nice, gruesome make-up effects. daniella is a beautiful twenty-something girl, carrying with her the trauma of being raped at the age of 13. nightmares and hallucinations lead her further into believing she\\'s the reincarnation of a female ancestor who was said to be a werewolf. she kills her brother-in-law during a nightly encounter and gets submitted in a hospital. she escapes again, however, and randomly devours more men whilst on the run for police detectives, doctors and relatives. it\\'s all pretty to look at and listen too (really great soundtrack), but the absence of plot and continuity become irritating quite fast. luckily enough, leading lady annik borel rarely ever wears clothes and she fills up the boring moments by dancing naked around a fire. the film is too long, too weird and too forgettable. the biggest surprise comes at the end, when suddenly and out of the blue, director rino di silvestro tries to make us believe that his movie was based on true facts. yeah, right... this is an interesting, hard to find movie from the early 70\\'s starring jan michael vincent as a young man who doesn\\'t make the cut as a marine. dressed in \\'baby blue\\' outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home, the failed recruits are sent packing. vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young richard gere who has just returned from a tour in the pacific as a hard-core marine \\'raider\\'. gere\\'s character is already jaded and contemplating desertion, and he takes advantage of vincent\\'s innocence, stealing his \\'baby blue\\' uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway. vincent\\'s character, whose name is marion, takes gere\\'s outfit and is suddenly transformed into a marine \\'raider\\'. marion hitch-hikes his way into wyoming and stops at a little norman rockwell-like little town. in the local cafã© he meets rose hudkins, who immediately catches his eye. staying with hudkins parents, marion attracts all sorts of attention from the towns folks. mr hudkins suspects marion and wonders how a marine \\'raider\\' could still be so innocent. the story also brings up the japanese internment camps, as the towns folks go \\'hunting\\' 3 escapees. marion is shot accidentally during this hunt. but there\\'s still a happy ending, which befuddled me a bit. i would have preferred a little more drama! anyway, this captures jmv at the peak of his 70\\'s performances. buster and billie, baby blue marine and white line fever in the mid-70\\'s were amazingly good jmv performances. he was both an action star and a heart-throb all at the same time!!! he made a lot of quality movies during his career, and continued to do so up into the mid 80\\'s with the great tv show airwolf. he does a very good job in this as \\'hedge\\', quietly observing the way people treat him (in his uniform) as he travels across the country. he must have performed some of the stunt work as well- there is a harrowing river scene at the end of the movie-and it looks like he\\'s the guy getting tossed down the river to me! but really, at the height of his popularity, this movie could have done so much more with jmv\\'s talent and his looks. innocence can only be so interesting. evil, as explored in \"buster and billie\", is much more dramatic! anyway, glynnis o\\'connor is delightful as rose. the whole look of the movie is like a norman rockwell painting. the outdoor scenes are gorgeous - must have been filmed in canada. johnny and june carter cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the gospel stories. the music is great, you get a real feel of what the world of jesus looked like (i\\'ve been there too), and june gets into the part of mary magdalene with a passion. cash\\'s narration is good too. but.... 1. the actor who played jesus was miscast. 2. there is no edge to the story like cash puts in some of his faith based music. 3. because it is uncompelling, i doubt we\\'ll see this ever widely distributed again. i\\'d love to buy the cd. tom paine texas, usa jã¤niksen vuosi is one of jarva\\'s most political movies. it takes stance strongly against modern day society\\'s authority status in the life of the common man, and how it has estranged men from the nature completely. it challenges the whole concept of freedom and wealth in our welfare society. vatanen (antti litja) - smothered buy the concrete jungle with all its rules and regulations - tries to rattle the chains of the society by escaping it all in to the wilderness of northern finland - only to realize that the concept of a \\'free country\\' isn\\'t all that unambiguous, in other words, the society has the common man by the balls. still the thing that makes jã¤niksen vuosi so exceptional - besides the visual and humouristic brilliance - is how it seems to illustrate the whole political atmosphere in finland in the 70\\'s, as well as the whole identity of finland as a nation. vatanen is like an archetype of a classical finn in his solitudeness and social distantness. since nature has always played such an important role in the national identity of us finns, the whole idea of that being slowly taken away by the modern society makes jã¤niksen vuosi emotionally exceptionally moving. i love jamie foxx. and i enjoy 99% of all movies i see. and i walked out of this one. now, i admit, it may have had something to do with the two middle-aged white women in the back of theatre who laughed at every little thing (\"oh no, jamie\\'s knocking on a door! hee hee hee!\"), but... this was just so incredibly annoying. there could be no sustained camera shot, and no camera shot from a conventional angle... everything had to be in-your-face, loud, and annoying. the bad guy tried to be smooth and malkovich-like, but at this point, it\\'s just old and tired. he brought nothing new or interesting. from all the characters, too many lines you saw coming, too many you\\'ve heard before, and too many \"tough guy\" lines... and i don\\'t mind that sort of thing, really, as long as there\\'s a bit of originality to it. in fact, pretty much the entire supporting cast just sucked. i love jamie foxx, and i think he\\'s really funny, and i thought he was funny in this movie... but not nearly funny enough for me to endure everything else. this movie needed less shoot-em-up, less annoying camera shots, more emotion, more feeling, and more jamie foxx. i gave it a 2. after seeing dick tracy in the 6.99$ bin at future shop i decided to give it a go with no previous knowledge and being a big fan of mafia and crime movies. i was very surprised to see a very fun, smart entertaining movie with solid performances throughout. the movie moves along well, it has of course another solid performance from warren beatty, but the real standouts of the film are al pacino and madonna. i was happy to find out that pacino was nominated for his performance as an over the top gangster trying to take down the city. madonna was great as the damsel in distress, she really impressed me and added depth to her performance. if you go in with the attitude of wanting to watch a fun, smart movie with great acting and a solid script then give dick tracy a try. i don\\'t think you will be disappointed. and watch for the cameos from paul sorvino, james caan, kathy bates and dustin hoffman among others. send them to the freezer. this is the solution two butchers find after they discover the popularity of selling human flesh. an incredible story with humor and possible allegories that make it much more than a horror film. the complex characters defy superficial classification and make the story intriguing and worthwhile - if you can stand it. definitely a dark film but also a bit redemptive. wow! i picked this off the rental shelf because i loved robert carlyle and jonny lee miller in \\'trainspotting.\\' this is a phenomenal movie; it has action, romance, suspense, intrigue and wit. when i wasn\\'t laughing, i was at the edge of my seat. this is definitely a film i would recommend to people with an appreciation for intelligent dialogue and a fresh perspective of the 18th century. this film has everything to keep me happy! i don\\'t know why some people criticise that show so much. it is a great, funny show - probably not the right material for mainstream prime-time, but still... the family dynamics are funny, and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows. the supporting characters are absolutely hilarious. the plots of the individual episodes and the frequent siegfried & roy jibes are only just above average, but ever so often you have sub-plots or one-liners that make you roll on the floor laughing. this show was well worth the 8 pounds i paid for it. rating: 8/10 mexican werewolf in texas is set in the small border town of furlough where anna (erika fay) lives, her best friend is rosie (martine hughes) & she has a mexican boyfriend named miguel (gabriel gutierrez) who are determined to track a beast down that has been terrorising the town, killing livestock & several residents including some of their friends. local mexican legends speak of the chupacabra, an evil creature from myth & legend. erm, i\\'m struggling now because not that much else actually happens... written & directed by scott maginnis i won\\'t beat about the bush here & simply say that mexican werewolf in texas is awful, period. the script only ever mentions the word werewolf once & the rest of the time it\\'s referred to a chupacabra, in fact i suspect this wasn\\'t really conceived as a werewolf flick at all. the \\'werewolf\\' creature looks mostly hairless & more like some vicious dog, there is no reference to anybody changing during the full moon & it actually attacks during the day on a couple of occasions, there is no transformation scene & at the end when it is killed it doesn\\'t change back into anyone either. to be honest apart from the title there\\'s nothing here to indicate a werewolf film at all & even then the title is just a rip-off of the highly popular an american werewolf in london (1981). this is the type of home made crap that i personally think is killing the horror genre, how long has it been since there was a true low budget horror classic like dawn of the dead (1978), the evil dead (1981), halloween (1978) or friday the 13th (1980) which were all made on shoe string budgets, maybe the blair witch project (1999) but that\\'s it in recent years & crap like mexican werewolf in texas has absolutely no chance of ever being considered a classic. the character\\'s are awful & things just happen around them, the dialogue is rubbish, the pacing is terrible, the story sucks & virtually sent me to sleep & as a whole this film is just crap, i\\'m sorry but i don\\'t know how else to describe it. director maginnis does nothing to make this watchable, there\\'s the annoying hand held camera type cinematography which could easily give someone a headache & quick \\'blink & you\\'ll miss something\\' editing which just annoys & irritates in equal measure. it\\'s not scary, there\\'s no nudity, there\\'s no tension or atmosphere & the special effects are awful. the monster really does look poor & it\\'s no wonder maginnis keeps it in the shadows or cuts his scenes so quickly you never get a good look at it. there\\'s virtually no colour to the picture either, it\\'s either almost pitch black or over saturated desert sand oranges which makes the thing an eye sore as well. the gore consists of some fake guts (blink & you\\'ll miss them!), a few bloody wounds & a severed arm, big deal. with a supposed budget of about $300,000 i admit the budget was low but i simply refuse to accept that for making such a rubbish film, there are plenty of low budget horror flicks that make their meagre budgets go far. the whole thing has the look of a home movie, it has no style & is throughly bland & dull to look at. the acting sucks too although you probably already knew that. mexican werewolf in texas will probably con a few people into renting/buying/watching it because they might mistakenly think it\\'s a sequel to john landis\\' classic which it most certainly isn\\'t & it isn\\'t even a proper werewolf flick either. don\\'t be fooled this is awful & i\\'m fed up of having to waste time/money on home made amateur crap like this. i found this to be a surprisingly light-handed touch at a 1950\\'s culture-clash movie. john wayne would hardly be one\\'s first choice as a cultural attache, being about as diplomatic with his good intentions as a bull-run in harrods. but this time he was left to play a part that was far more passive than his usual bluff persona, and he accomplished his task with style. the duke was a guy who really could act well. his facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtle. despite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time, he failed to dominate this movie. many of his good intentions came a cropper. he had authority over nobody, and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom he was the barbarian. the story of american attempts to curry favour with an isolationist japan was one of political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hell-for-leather battles. i cannot comment on the accuracy of its research but the strangeness of the oriental culture to western sensibilities was demonstrated well. there was a great deal of minutely-choreographed ceremony entailing what looked to this observer like authentic costume and props. the set pieces were complex and detailed. a lot of money and thought had been applied to it. the fractured romance between wayne and his geisha added a little extra element, and stopped the movie becoming just a political or flag-waving effort. script was good without being too wordy. there was a great deal of japanese dialogue, but the lengthy periods of translation didn\\'t interfere with the narrative. it was nice to see plenty of genuine orientals on the set. whether or not they were japanese, i couldn\\'t say. but anyway they looked the part. at least the leads were not played by cross-dressing caucasians, unlike other efforts such as \\'blood alley\\' (yes, i know they were chinese) \\'the inn of the sixth happiness\\' or even \\'the king and i\\'. frankly, i enjoyed this more than any of those other movies. the script was better for a start. i never liked the songs in \\'the king and i\\', and wasn\\'t impressed by the heavy-laden anti-communist subtext of \\'blood alley\\'. i confess to never having seen this work before and found it compared very favourably to many of the duke\\'s more popular outings. recommended. i was so glad i came across this short film. i\\'m always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across, so when i saw this and saw that it was nominated for the live action short film at the academy awards, i was so pleased that i actually had a film that i was rooting for. the plot is pretty simple, the director, writer, and star nacho vigalondo tried coming up with a reason people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musicals. the result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really catchy. it\\'s a well made short film, well edited and the actors all do a great job. and the last shot of the film is perfect. i highly recommend this film. i thought before starting with these movie that it might be a good one, but when i started with it i found it really awful. they said movie is being made in afghanistan but i think 95% of the movie is shot in india. you can see indian made cars. you can see lars drinking bisleri(an indian water brand), hindi written on the road, you can also see temples in afghanistan *hahah* its really funny and many more stuff which proves its not shot in afghanistan. i think one should not waste his/her time watching this movie.. pure time waste.. i would recommend to do something else instead of watching this movie or may be might heart is better idea but don\\'t watch this waste of time truly appalling waste of space. me and my friend tried to watch this film to its conclusion but had to switch it off about 30 minutes from the end. and i can count the films i have switched off before the end on one hand. the script and direction are leaden and deeply uninspiring. i wouldn\\'t be surprised if they found the script in a pile of cast off scripts from 1983. for example the irritating scroat threatening the real estate guy from his house phone. i mean seriously. the police would be beating his door down in minutes. the scenes and events just wash by you like turds in a river. it is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film. the narrative flicks between characters in a seemingly random manner breaking up the pathetic attempts at building the characters. oh and what \"characters\" they are. the protagonist played by rourke is dreadful. he could have just sent a cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed. after 60 or so minutes of the film i had built absolutely zero attachment to this character. he is neither sympathetic nor hateful. just a disfigured dummy from a shop window blundering through every single scene. his motivation is impossible to discern from his generally mumbled and emotionless delivery. is he happy? is he sad? angry? no idea. just those same dead eyes staring out at you from a disfigured chunk of flesh. and the native american theme is just awful and pointless. the good guys are at best unlikeable. a dull white collar stereotype and a simpering neurotic ex-wife stereotype. cue archetypal wife with shotgun face off with bad guy, \"you aren\\'t going to shoot me\" that is both tiresomely unoriginal and annoying. the richie nix character seems interesting at first but soon descends into an irritating one sided psycho character. which seems at odds with the seeming intention of making the bad guys in some way sympathetic or at least realistically motivated. roasario dawsons character starts with some promise but soon descends into a sickening and childlike parody of the gangsters chick scenes from jackie brown. you really want me to believe her character was so attracted to rourke\\'s? or worse she is just a floozy who sleeps with anything that moves? realistic female characters ftw! in summary a complete mess of a film. hopeless characterisations and performances. a leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction. and ultimately extremely dull. its not even comedy bad either. laughing at rourkes haggard face gets pretty old after sitting through the first 15 turgid minutes of the film. in this movie, chã¡vez supporters (either venezuelan and not-venezuelan) just lie about a dramatic situation in our country. they did not say that the conflict started because of chã¡vez announcement firing a lot of pdvsa best workers just for political issues. they did not say anything about more than 96 tv interruptions transmitted by chã¡vez during only 3 days in \"cadena nacional\" (a kind of confiscation o private tv signals). each one with about 20 minutes of duration. they did not tell us anything about the quiting announcement made by general en jefe lucas rincon romero, inspector general of the army forces, who is a traditional supporter of chã¡vez. even now, in despite of his announcement, he is the ministro de interior y justicia. after chã¡vez return he occuped the charge of ministro del defensa (equals to defense secretary in us). they did not say anything about chã¡vez orders about shooting against a pacifical people concentration who was claiming for elections. they did not say anything about the people in this concentration that were killed by chã¡vez supporters (either civilians and military official forces). they present some facts in a wrong order, in order to lie. they did not say anything about venezuelan civilian society thats are even now claiming for an elections in order to solve the crisis and chã¡vez actions in order to avoid the elections. that\\'s why i tell you.... this movie is just a lot of lies or a big lie. one could wish that an idea as good as the \"invisible man\" would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects, but this is not the case. the story, the characters and, finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad-scientist flick from the early 50\\'s. there are some great moments, mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets. but alas, soon we\\'re back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable, but schematic. there has been a great many remakes of old films or tv shows over the past 10 years, and some of them have their charms. but it\\'s becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol\\' classics under the noses of eager madmen like verhoeven (who does have his moments) is a very bad one. it is obvious that the money is the key issue here: the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough, and as a result, \"hollow man\" is seriously undermined with clichã©s, sappy characters, predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever. however, the one thing that actually impressed me, beside the special effects, was the swearing. when making this kind of film, modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them. therefore, the language (and, sometimes, the violence and sex) is very toned down. when the whole world blows up, the good guys go \"oh darn!\" and \"oh my god\". \"hollow man\" gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them. i\\'m not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear - but it makes it more believable if someone actually swears. i think we can thank verhoeven for that. ok, so it owes pulp fiction, but in my opinion has it\\'s own voice and identity mainly because of the music-video direction style, sketch-like narrative and great performances. thomas jane delivers great (the drug-dealer show-down is extraordinary), aaron eckhart likewise. james legros has a short and effervescent appearance-great humor-\"they got the wong house\". the porzikova interrogation and rape scene is memorable, as is mickey rourke\\'s cameo appearance-\"take a peak\". great hollywood popcorn b-production with strong performances of a-level aspirants and renegades(rourke). well, take a peak, it\\'s worth. as far as i know the real guy that the main actor is playing saw his performance and said it was an outstanding portrayal, i\\'d agree with him. this is a fantastic film about a quite gifted boy/man with a special body part helping him. oscar and bafta winning, and golden globe nominated daniel day-lewis plays christy browna crippled man with cerebral palsy who spends most of his life on the floor, in a wheelchair and carried by his family. he has a special left foot though, he can write with it, paint with it and hold things with it. he learns to speak later in the film, it is very good for a guy like him. also starring home alone 2\\'s oscar winning, and golden globe nominated brenda fricker as mrs. brown and bafta winning ray mcanally as mr. brown. it was nominated the oscars for best director for jim sheridan, best writing, screenplay based on material from another medium and best picture, it was nominated the baftas for best film, best make up artist and best adapted screenplay. daniel day-lewis was number 85 on the 100 greatest movie stars, he was number 20 on the 50 greatest british actors, he was number 9 on britain\\'s finest actors, and he was number 15 on the world\\'s greatest actor, and the film was number 28 on the 50 greatest british films. outstanding! all i ever heard while being raised was equality of the sexes, and here we have a film that not only exemplifies imbalance, but continues through with a whole concept that one sex is better. all the while watching i was hoping for that redeeming quality to make the viewer feel as though there is hope for the future, and there wasn\\'t. i\\'ll admit to not finishing the film, i had to turn it off at the part where the old man whore told the genetic man adam that it was ok to be a whore and get, and i quote, \"more tail than any man in the past time.\" i know not finishing it is a bad review on myself, but it is the responsibility of the writer and crew to develope a story that will keep a viewer interested, and they failed. this film betrays all true female nature qualities of the mother figure and the need for balance. instead it exemplifies what america ran by lesbian natzis would be like,and i\\'m not against lesbians. thank you mr. director! someone please give me a redeeming quality... wait i have it! there\\'s no sequel! i do regret that i have bought this series. i expected more action, more objective picture and more consistency. this is just a pure propaganda series, very dark, without any charm, or romanticism, it is just boredom itself. i find the actors work quite weak as well. o\\'donnell might seem charming as robin (with batman), but in this picture he lacks any charm. probably while he becomes older, he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up. it comes as no surprise, that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the uk for 40% of the recommended price and was not even released in the netherlands. the story has been told before. a deadly disease is spreading around... but the extra in this film is peter weller, his interpretation of muller on the run is real. he is indeed a desperate person just going home to see his child. this person could be working next to you. this film was very well advertised. i am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months. while i was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be, my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it. then i went and saw it, i was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until i remembered that i had paid for this movie. i made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood i was in, plus i wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie! i always go into a movie with an open mind, not trying to go into them with too many expectations, but this movie was not that funny. now it wasnt the worst movie i\\'ve ever seen, but it is definitely worth waiting for hbo. if you havent seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it, but for true comedy fans id say pass. maybe even check out the kings of comedy again. something told me to go see meet the parents instead!!! as far as i know this was my first experience with icelandic movies. it\\'s such a relief to see something else than your regular hollywood motion picture. too bad that movies like this one have a small chance of succeeding in the big world. i can only hope that people watch this by accident, by recommendation or other... because it\\'s really worth while. i left the cinema feeling really sad. i couldn\\'t get the tragic destiny\\'s of the characters out of my head. and it impressed me even more when i thought of the complexity of the film. not only was it a tragic story, it had excellent comic reliefs and a very good soundtrack. if you have the opportunity, watch it! it\\'s really thought provoking and made me ponder a lot. very typical almodã³var of the time and, in its own way, no less funny than many of his later works. and why is that? there is nothing to be provoked or shocked about, and i guess any such effect is more coincidental than intentional. no, the great humor stems from an underlying, almost surreal, absurdity that is woven into the scenery: the characters\\' nearly complete lack of taboo. it\\'s the same kind of \\'comic suspense\\' you find in his later works, though you\\'ll find it in a more rough version here. he\\'s building up for masterpieces to come, but is not yet there. the sole reviewer who commented on this movie before i did, claimed that it had to be a \"very select\" group of people who\\'d find this movie hilarious. i do. once again, doctor who delivers the goods by the bucket load. it has humour (\"you\\'re just making it up as you go along!\" \"yup, but i do it brilliantly\"), action, monsters (in this case still more kick-ass cybermen), tragedy and scare tactics. in short, just what the doctor ordered (pun intended). the way that the emotions move from one to the other is done so well that there is no feeling of \"get on with it\". so, chalk up 3 out of the last 4 episodes that have made you laugh, then made you cry, and made you go \"eek\". in terms of character development, this is clearly the clincher for noel clarke\\'s mickey (and ricky). being one of the doctor\\'s companions, you know that he will do the right thing, and may even suspect the manner that he does it. however, it is still an emotional wrench when he confirms his future path. while \"the rise of the cybermen\" had more of the sinister build up to terror, \"the age of steel\" is an all out blast. like \"alien\" compared to \"aliens\" - both true classics, but in different ways. can the series keep it up at this level? let\\'s hope so. a brother\\'s promise is a wonderful family film. this is a biography of dan jansen, a champion olympic speed skater. the movie depicts this athlete\\'s life from a young age through full adulthood. the love and support of the family members is evident throughout. how dan and the rest of his family handle winning and losing races is a life lesson for all of us. the commitment and determination of dan\\'s coach and his teammates, shows what it takes to make a real team. how dan and his family deal with a devastating illness of a loved one is depicted without undo sentiment or sugarcoating. the faith of the family is shown in basic terms and is obviously a major part of their lives. this is a powerful family film which can be meaningful for a person of any age. well...now that i know where rob zombie stole the title for his \"house of 1,000 corpses\" crapfest, i can now rest in peace. nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in \"the house of seven corpses,\" but a groovie ghoulie comes up from his plot (ha!) anyway, to kill the bloody amateurs making a low-rent horror flick in his former abode! in hell house (sorry, i don\\'t remember the actual name of the residence), a bunch of mysterious, unexplained deaths took place long ago; some, like arthritic lurch stand-in john carradine (whose small role provides the film\\'s only worthwhile moments), attribute it to the supernatural; bellowing film director john ireland dismisses it as superstitious hokum. the result comes across like \"satan\\'s school for girls\" (catchy title; made-for-tv production values; intriguing plot) crossed with \"children shouldn\\'t play with dead things\" (low-rent movie about low-rent movie makers who wake the dead); trouble is, it\\'s nowhere near as entertaining or fun. \"the house of seven corpses\" is dead at frame one, and spends the rest of its 89 minutes going through rigor mortis, dragging us along for every aching second... director sidney lumet has made some masterpieces,like network,dog day afternoon or serpico.but,he was not having too much luck on his most recent works.gloria (1999) was pathetic and find me guilty was an interesting,but failed experiment.now,lumet brings his best film in decades and,by my point of view,a true masterpiece:before the devil knows you\\'re dead.i think this film is like a rebirth for lumet.this movie has an excellent story which,deeply,has many layers.also,i think the ending of the movie is perfect.the performances are brilliant.philip seymour hoffman brings,as usual,a magnificent performance and he\\'s,no doubt,one of the best actors of our days.ethan hawke is also an excellent actor but he\\'s underrated by my point of view.his performance in here is great.the rest of the cast is also excellent(specially,the great albert finney) but these two actors bring monumental performances which were sadly ignored by the pathetic oscars.the film has a good level of intensity,in part thanks to the performances and,in part,thanks to the brilliant screenplay.before the devil knows you\\'re dead is a real masterpiece with perfect direction,a great screenplay and excellent performances.we need more movies like this. i took my 14 year old to see this movie. we left after 15 or 20 minutes. it was absolutely awful! this movie should be rated r at the least. i am not that strict with movies but, this was just too much. it was a waste of money. i thought it would contain some comedy and i knew the comedy would probably be crude but, this was way beyond crude. i was sitting there watching and reading (a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me) and i could not believe how crudely sexual it was. i could not believe that it would be ok for a 13 year old to read and see this content. i don\\'t understand how the rating system works.?? i loved this film. i thought it would be easy to watch, and easy to forget. i ran out after watching this to buy the dvd, obv not easily forgotten! the script is brilliant, and the casting couldn\\'t be more perfect. each character has their moment, and i laughed hard throughout this film, comedic timing was spot-on. it\\'s not easy to find judas kiss on vhs (it\\'s not available on dvd), but i wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my alan rickman movie collection. i can\\'t understand how the talented mr. rickman gets into these mediocre films? judas kiss boasts several wonderful actors, an interesting plot and intriguing twists, but its strange visual wanderings and chopping editing ruined what might have been a great crime drama. many scenes seem to be missing vital information to explain the character\\'s actions: why was our hero immediately suspicious of his bosses? why did he mistrust the detective he replaced? there were times when i honestly couldn\\'t tell if the director meant judas kiss to be a legitimate crime drama or a campy spoof. why else would he toss in a topless/alien/lesbian porno scene in the first two minutes (that little surprise certainly made me scramble for the remote since my kids were playing nearby!)? did he purposely instruct his two distinguished english actors (alan rickman and emma thompson) to use such awful new orlean\\'s accents? as an alan freak, i confess that i still thought mr. rickman was sexy: in a rumpled, weary, \"take-him-home-and-tuck-him-in\" sort of way. judas kiss isn\\'t a great movie, but it does have some intriguing moments, but i don\\'t recommend it unless you\\'re trying to immerse yourself in alan rickman. first of all, i should point out that i really enjoyed watching this documentary. not only it had great music in it, but the shots and the editing were also wonderful. however, all these positive things about the film does not change the fact that it plays to the orientalist \"east meets west\" clichã© that bothers many turks like myself. okay, this film tells the story of traditional and contemporary turkish music in a very stylish manner which is a good thing, something that would show ignorant europeans and americans that this country is not just about murdering armenians and kurds. however, the problematic of the film is that it looks at what it defines as \"east\" from the eyes of the \"west\". i mean, like one jazz musician says in the film, maybe there is no east and west, maybe it is just a myth, a lie created by the ruling leaders of \"western\" countries in order to keep fear and hostility alive so that they could continue ruling the world and \"keep the cash flowing\"? why don\\'t you think about that? stmd! is not a terrible movie, but it is quite forgettable. the lighting is intentionally poor in many scenes and unintentionally poor in all the rest, so you are likely to come out of a viewing with a headache or eye-strain. special effects are imaginative, but obvious. the gratuitous nudity essential for teen slasher flicks is there, of course, along with the archetypical teenagers, but the whole movie just doesn\\'t gel. what was needed was some snappier dialogue and more tongue-in-cheek humor. i can\\'t really recommend that you use your time watching this movie. i often give a nod to a movie based on just a scene or two that demonstrates imagination or humor, but these are sadly lacking in this film. first off, i have no idea how this movie made it to the big screen. its not even the low budget sci-fi channel movie, its just awful. me and my friend who love action movies, independence day, jurassic park, lotr, etc. went to see this movie expecting this movie to me a transformers with dragons, mindless entertainment. all we got was a mindless hour and a half. the cg was not as bad as i was expecting, but the plot is so awful along with the acting, it made up for it. its basically a chinese legged of dragons returning every 500 years...sounds like a good remake of rain of fire? no, the plot tries to be deeper than it should be leaving not only plot holes, but with magic, and a very small actual war between dragons(rather big snakes) it just gets ridiculous. the director attempted to add a bit of humor in the movie which fail. me and my friend laughed through the whole thing(along with all 5 of the audience), and cant believed we spent money on this. the short trailer on tv makes up for most of the action while crap makes up the rest. i\\'ve seen a lot of b movies like reptilian, the cave, spider, and others, but i have to say if you want a non stop laugh for an hour, watch this. story: 1/10 cg: 5/10 acting:3/10 i don\\'t drink...but it would have helped before watching this movie i am not exactly how sure the accuracy is with this movie, but i can tell you that i was thoroughly entertained by this movie. the character of gust,played perfectly by phillip seymour hoffman, was one of the most unique, yet entertaining characters in recent memory. this movie informed,yet managed to avoid preaching to the audience. it made me laugh, made me sad, made me feel alive, and glad to be spending the time to watch the movie. it takes no time to understand what is going on, and takes you on a roller coaster ride of genuine, human emotion. i thought i knew my history, apparently i didn\\'t know it at all! i give this move 9 out of 10, and recommend it for all adults, and young adults, and the young at heart, just not the young. but as soon as they are allowed to see \"r\" rated movies, make it a priority. i must have seen this a dozen times over the years. i was about fifteen when i first saw it in b & w on the local pbs station. i bought a dvd set for the children to see, and am making them watch it. they don\\'t teach history in school, and this explains the most critical event of the 20th century. it expands their critical thinking. impartially, with the participants on all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why, it details what lead up to the war and the actual war. buy it for your children, along with alistair cooke\\'s america. watch it with them, and make them understand. you\\'ll be so glad you did. steven seagal\\'s films of late have not exactly been good, but this is by far the worst since the patriot. the plot makes no sense what so ever; it is never clear in what the relationships between the characters are, who works for who or who is double crossing who. the film is completely disjointed, each scene seems to confuse the story further rather than carry it forward. even the action sequences are uninspired and hard to follow. most of the blame must lie at the director\\'s feet for not even understanding the basics of film making, but seagal does not get off lightly, as one of the producers of this film, he must also share the blame. oh, and i haven\\'t even mentioned how awful the acting is, even by seagal standards. even as straight to video fodder, this is not worth a view even for seagal fans. give it a wide berth! and i for one think that is a good thing. i\\'ve just never been a rosalind russell fan although the original was my favorite rr movie. but i love bette and was thrilled to hear she was making this. as for the rest of the production, i think it was slightly less than the original movie. one of my favorite minor characters in the original was mazeppa with her scratchy fingernails-on-the-blackboard voice belting out \"hey! it takes a lot more than no talent to be a strippah!\" and although i missed it, i was glad to see the producers had the guts not to do a carbon copy. i also liked the fact there are large portions of this movie which were filmed as if you are looking at a stage, it gives a feeling that you are in the theatre, not just at the movies. i think the other thing i liked about this production was that there seemed to be slightly less repetition of the song \"let me entertain you\", which becomes completely annoying after about the 5th time you hear it. so real and surreal, all in one. i remember feeling like tessa. heck, i remember being tessa. this was a beautiful vignette of a relationship ending. i especially liked the protesters tangent. it is nice to see symbolism in a movie without being smacked over the head with it. if you get the chance to see this, take it. it is well worth the 30 minutes. thank god i watched this at a friend\\'s place and did not pay for it. the plot is horribly transparent and the whole movie felt like an episode of a tv show. if you have any knowledge of computers or electronics, watch out. you will feel feel like the movie is an insult to your intelligence. also, actress turned much music vj amanda walsh displays the worst acting i have ever seen, excluding porn. she\\'s lucky that matt lanter is actually decent. he\\'s the one that carries the movie. i hate that i wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this movie! it\\'s a shame that they got to call it a sequel, because i was a fan of the original, which was actually pretty good. a friend lent me this dvd, which he got from the director at a festival, i think. i went in warned that some of the technical aspects of the movie were a bit shaky and that the writing was good but not great. so maybe that colored my judgment but i have to admit that i liked this movie. the standouts where the actors. youssef kerkor was really good as ernie, the main character, kind of pathetic in a likable way. adam jones (who also directed) and justin lane were excellent as the roommates who drive ernie mad. the bill character (justin lane), who spends a lot of the film dressed like a panda, was by far my favorite; he seemed the least one-dimensional, and reminded me of an old college roommate so much i called the guy after watching the dvd. really kind of lovable, and very funny. some of the other acting was good, some was so-so, but none of it was bad. i also really liked the vigilante duo. ridiculous and funny. i\\'m giving this one high marks, even though it has some issues, because you can tell when you watch it that these people cared, and decided to make their movie their way. well done to adam jones and crew. shawshank, godfather, pulp fiction... all good films. great films. but nothing, and i mean nothing lives up to the greatest christmas movie of all, santa claus. the film is so great and has so many messages, i cried while watching it. seriously, this is one of those movies you need to watch 10 times. when we see pitch get told he will have to eat ice cream, we see the sadness in his eyes, and we feel the deep sorrow, and then we wonder... what is so bad about this ice cream? is it implying that we as humans are treating ice cream as good when all it does is make us evil? think movie makes you think. this movie has the best rendition of santa claus ever. unlike other santas, he is a normal person. we see him imprisoning children and spying on kids dreams, and we wonder; is the santa we believe in really that good? also, this santa actually mentions christ, the whole meaning behind christmas. you owe yourself to watch this cinematic masterpiece. we should just stop making movies and air nothing but this epic 24/7. whether it\\'s christmas or not, this movie gets a 500/10. whoever says this movie is bad is an ignorant fool. i really cant think of anything good to say about this film...not a single thing. the script is a nightmare.. the writer blurs the line between chemical and biological traits and doesnt seem to understand the difference. you\\'d think they would at least get a technical advisor. the performances were bad by most of the cast... although i dont really blame them.. the material really stinks. the editing was equally bad.. i\\'ll just stop now.. its all bad 2/10 cinema\\'s greatest period started in post-war europe with italy\\'s neo-realist movement. during the next 2 or 3 decades that followed, france\\'s new wavers caught everyone\\'s attention, and there was always bergman up there on his desolate scandinavian island somewhere, making bitter masterpieces. but in 1971, luchino visconti brought the art-form to full circle, geographically speaking, with his miraculous work *death in venice*, which might as well be called *the death of europoean cinema*. after the sixties wound down, so did the great european filmmakers, who, with some exceptions, generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new american generation of movie brats (coppola, scorsese, & co.). this movie absolutely feels like a grand summing-up, not just of visconti\\'s particular obsessions, but of the general attempt of european filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies. and rest assured, you will find no sterner task-master than the visconti revealed here. he\\'s not playing to the crowd, folks: either you get behind him and follow along, or you get left behind. the pacing is a challenge: slow, but never without emotional weight. \"incidents\" are few and far between, but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturm-und-drang cosmos. we will probably never be in such rarefied company again, in terms of the movies: one of the century\\'s great writers who inspired the tale (thomas mann), one of the greatest filmmakers directing it (visconti), one of the greatest actors in the lead role (dirk bogarde), and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background, gustav mahler\\'s 5th symphony. taking full advantage of mahler\\'s ability to inspire romanticism in even the most cynical breast, visconti changes the main character, aschenbach, into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer, even making bogarde up to look like mahler (geeky mustache, specs, shaggy hair, duck-like walk). bogarde, by the way, delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies: it\\'s a largely silent performance, and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance -- a difficult trick without mugging like chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse. cinema just doesn\\'t get better than this. i\\'ll ignore the complaints from the ritalin-addicts out there who say that it\\'s too slow, but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of aschenbach\\'s flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced. the flashbacks fit neatly within the movie\\'s thematic concerns (i.e., which is the better path to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?), and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers. (of course, some viewers will sleep through this movie, anyway.) a nonstop stream of mahler and beautiful, dying venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture; but this movie is actually about something. and what it\\'s mostly about is suffering: romantic (capital r) suffering, in particular. as a suffering romantic himself, visconti knew whereof he spoke. [spoiler . . . i guess] if for nothing else, see *death in venice* for its portentous opening credits . . . and for its unforgettable ending, with bogarde\\'s jet-black hair-dye dripping off of his sweaty, dying head and onto his chalk-white face. meanwhile, off in the distance, young tadzio, the object of bogarde\\'s dying desire, stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a michelangelo sculpture. the climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about: love, lust, beauty, loss, the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life, and cold death in the midst of warm, sunny beauty. *death in venice* is a miraculous work of art. [dvd tip: as with the simultaneously released visconti masterpiece *the damned*, i recommend that you turn the english subtitles on while watching this movie. it\\'s ostensibly in english, but the dvd\\'s sound seems muddy and there\\'s a lot of italian spoken during the film, anyway.] this is a stereotype plot. a young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school. this leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight. the fights are not of high standards. they are way too \"simple\" in a way that 1+1 is simple to every adult. the fighter has trained and enters the ring, but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kicking. the coach yells do this and do that with no success. and after some more of this ridiculous beating he suddenly does what he is told and hits his opponent once. this results in a turning point in the fight, although our hero has been taking a beating of his life up until that point. think about the rocky movies and you\\'ll have a good point of reference of how much beating he really takes. the fights are also shot poorly. there final thing that screws this film up is the stupid romance. cheesy music and awkward moments are not what i call entertainment. these guys really could have made some quality entertainment, but the director wasn\\'t up to the task. or the other crew in my opinion. maybe they had a small budget, i don\\'t know, but what matters in the end is that this movie is bad and deserves the rating of 3 out of 10. this production was quite a surprise for me. i absolutely love obscure early 30s movies, but i wasn\\'t prepared for the last 25 minutes of this story. if, by any chance, you\\'re not convinced in the first half, hang in there for the finale. of course, you must look at the blatant racism as being purely topical. a fascinating viewing experience, but i think the cat\\'s paw is not available on video/dvd yet. watch your pbs listings! it isn\\'t too bad, but ultimately it lacks the quality that the australian series has. the jokes are few and far between, the actors are attractive (they shouldn\\'t be), the film makers think far too much about the cinematography (it\\'s supposed to look like a home video) and it\\'s just like a serious version of kath and kim... it\\'s stupid. it\\'s too normal to be kath and kim. kath and kim are supposed to be two curvy, middle-aged women who think they are hot and wear ridiculous clothes. there are no \"look at me kimmy!\" jokes. the fat friend of kim is not fat at all and she\\'s not even slightly stupid. she\\'s a stereotypical black/latino chick. it\\'s just not as stupid or funny as the australian series. it doesn\\'t compare. nothing is the same. i admit, this show is pretty funny at times, but it is not anything like the aussie series. i was looking forward to an american take on a bogan family. they failed. it\\'s supposed to be really stupid and hilarious, but the actors don\\'t act stupid! to me, this is just a typical american tv show. it\\'s a let down if you want it to be anything like the aussie show. 2 stars because it is an okay show, just nothing like what it should be. from the decrepit ranks of the already over-saturated \\'hillybilly horror\\' sub-genre comes this woeful tale of a vacationing family terrorized by inbred rednecks. sound familiar? well it most definitely should to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the horror genre. there is absolutely new here. the film seems content to recycle all thee old worn out clichã©s (deformed hicks, a peaceful family turned gun-toting killers when push comes to show, the rebellious daughter, the one \\'freak\\' who\\'s good at heart, etcetera...), but does even that half-heartedly enough to make this an utter waste of time. this is forgettable dreck, but humorously enough lead j.d. hart once starred in a movie called \"films that suck\" earlier in his career, quite an ironic omen indeed. my grade: d- as a huge baseball fan, my scrutiny of this film is how realistic it appears. dennis quaid had all of the right moves and stances of a major league pitcher. it is a fantastic true story told with just a little too much \"disney\" for my taste. this film takes you on one family\\'s impossible journey, and makes you feel every step of their odyssey. beautifully acted and photographed, heartbreakingly real. its last line, with its wistful hope, is one of the more powerful in memory. stupid! stupid! stupid! i can not stand ben stiller anymore. how this man is allowed to still make movies is beyond me. i can\\'t understand how this happens if i performed at work the way he acts in a movie i\\'d get fired and i own the company.....i would have to fire myself. god! this movie was just a plain, steaming, stinking pile of poo, that needs to be vapoorized if that were possible. something else i have to say the guideline about 10 lines of text in a comment is idiotic. what is wrong with just saying a few things about a movie? i will never understand why sites will require a short novel written when sometimes a brief comment is all that is necessary. this show is great for many reasons..the father and mother can communicate with their kids this day in age. its so great to see a real family instead of some stuffy overacting family. i watched this one time and became hooked.it so great to see a black family on tv worth watching. this show left too soon but on its way out it dealt with pregnancy, sexy, drugs, bad dates,death etc .the best thing about the show was that it dealt with it in a real humorous sort of way. great show for the family ..i cant tell you how many times i have sat up watched this show late at night sometimes and laughed my head off. great pg 13 rated show.i loved everybit of this show. this film is where the batman franchise ought to have stopped. though i will concede that the ideas behind \"batman forever\" were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director, as it turned out this was not to be the case. apparently warner brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second batman film from tim burton turned out. apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from burton, and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the sixties tv series, i fail to understand how \"batman returns\" can be considered at all disappointing. true, it is not quite the equal of the first film - though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in \"batman,\" a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of keaton and jack nicholson as the joker in the first film. yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film, true to the way the batman was always meant to be, and highly satisfying. michael keaton returns as the batman and his alter ego bruce wayne, tangling with nouveau riche tycoon max schreck (christopher walken, named in honour of the 1920s german silent actor), his partner-in-crime oswald cobblepot, the penguin (danny devito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of laurence olivier\\'s \"richard iii\"), and selina kyle, the catwoman (michelle pfeiffer), whom wayne romances both as himself and as the batman. the four principals turn in excellent performances, especially walken and devito, while together keaton and pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities. there are some intriguing concepts in this film. about the only weakness i can really point out is a certain limpness to the script in some places, which i think is due mostly to the way this film is a four-cornered fight. there simply isn\\'t enough time to properly explore what\\'s going on. nevertheless, this is a damn good film. i highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first, and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under burton and keaton. the quick and the undead is, finally, the first movie to actually render its own storyline null and void. it is, essentially, one gigantic plot hole. aside from that, the acting was quite bad, character motivations nonexistent or unbelievable and there wasn\\'t a single character worth hanging our hat on. the most interesting cast member (who had great potential to be a dark horse protagonist) got snuffed halfway through the proceedings. what the quick and the undead does serve as is an excellent example of how to do good color-timing. it looked excellent, when you take into account budget considerations. unfortunately, it plays out like a guy got his hands on a hundred grand and watched a few westerns (most notably the good, the bad and the ugly) and then just threw a bunch of elements haphazardly into a movie... \"you know, they have movies where characters do this! does it fit here? no, but who cares! they do it in other movies so i should do it here!\" maybe a good view for burgeoning cinematographers and colorists (first-year film-schoolers). otherwise, a must-miss. i was stunned by this film. afterwards, i didn\\'t even want to see any films for a long time- any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison. for many, it may be the worst of antonioni- very slow, without an engaging conventional story line, microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions- and the worst of wenders- verbose, confused transcendentalism. it is composed of short distinct episodes linked by wenders\\' typical meandering hero\\'s stream of consciousness, so it doesn\\'t produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema. but for fans, the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film. wenders and antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of things. am i the only person who thinks that the entire forensics and scenes of crime community in the usa must detest this almighty slap in their faces. a rookie cop is first to a crime scene where her back up is so slow to respond that she has time to send the kid who found the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera. by the time he returns (still no senior cops, socos or other assistance for the lovely jolie - this is new york isn\\'t it??) it has started raining and she gets to work photographing the evidence, only after she\\'d stood in front of an amtrak to stop it disturbing the scene. i want to know the name of that camera as the photographs were so incredibly detailed that no amount of zooming in distorted the images!! the horror continues:- not in the film itself (pretty ordinary i\\'m afraid) but in the lincoln rhyme character as played by mr washington. this man is a highly dedicated forensic crime scene examiner with years of experience who, instead of the highly trained but invisible local crime scene examiners, entrusts the work to an untrained cop, a rookie cop, who proceeds to find the very obviously placed clues and move them before photographing them thus contaminating every item and making dna profiling well nigh impossible. now that was a bright idea eh? i know one should be able to suspend disbelief to a degree but those who say this film is intelligent must have entirely disengaged their ability to think in order to find this film believable. i have given this film 4/10 for the superb acting of denzel washington and for miss jolie\\'s lips which are the only items requiring my disbelief to be suspended! the one of the most remarkable sci-fi movies of the millennium. not only a movie but an incredible future vision, this movie establishes a new standard of s/f movies. hail and kill! this is the second hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second hitchcock film i\\'ve seen in full, the first was rope, which i really enjoyed. with saboteur hitchcock was more room to roam free, whereas rope took place all in one room. i didn\\'t enjoy this one as much as rope but that\\'s not saying this is a bad film, it just seems like an average flick that could have been something more. it seems like a film hitchcock would make as a break in between his more serious ones. as a thriller, i feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the states. the climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension. the sound design is almost non existent. you can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them, but the important things are missing, the stitches ripping apart from the sleeve, the need of music to amp of the tension, all missing. intentional no doubt, yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such a scene. then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside. the film doesn\\'t feel like it should either, they are almost globe trotting from place to place, yet it feels more confined. the script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse ways to get the plot moving. the performances are there, but nothing amazing. everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page. the relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work. the one stand out is otto kruger, who has that rich, ego, evil persona down pat. in the end, i wanted more from this one. i understand it\\'s one of hitchcock\\'s least exciting films, but i did have a good time watching it. i can recommend it, just not enthusiastically. it is always difficult to bring a 450 pages book down to a three hours film. i read the book before, and i found the bbc production dealing with this difficulty in the best way possible. the qualities of the book haven\\'t been lost: the dense and lively depiction of a fingersmith patchwork family in london in the 1860s, the cold and obscene cruelty in which maud is brought up, the characterization of different social groups by different ways of speaking, the unexpected and surprising twists of the story, the way the film makes the spectators look different at the same scenes when they are told first from sue\\'s point of view then from maud\\'s one. the main actors do very good, and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed, with a first culmination in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and did to each other, because they still love each other. for each of her books the author, sarah waters, has thoroughly investigated what life was like in british 19th century. while in tipping the velvet it was the world of the vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements, in affinity the dreadful reality of women penitentiaries and the fashionable evocation of spirits, in fingersmith she depicts the public ceremony of hanging people in london and the inhuman treatment of persons supposed or declared disturbed in asylums based on the reading of sources and scientific research. this is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high grade of historic truth. i highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful victorian atmosphere, vivid emotions, and suspense. this is one of my all time favorite cheap, corny, vampire b movies. calvin klein underwear model...oh, i mean, stefan the good vampire, returns to transylvania to ascend the throne of vampiric royalty, but manicure-impaired and eternally drooling half brother radu has other plans. having killed their father the vampire king, radu now sets his sights on stefan, stefan\\'s new mortal girlfriend michelle and her two pretty friends, and the all-powerful bloodstone. okay, the scenery is beautiful, and it should be as it was shot on location in transyl-fricken-vania for gosh sakes. the actresses are no great shakes and stefan the heroic vampire is about as charming as a refrigerated fireplace poker, but who cares? there\\'s only one reason to watch this movie, and his name is radu! he\\'s a physical homage to nosferatu and he has the best lines in the movie, all spoken in the raspy voice of a man who smokes ten packs of cigarettes a day. the cemetery festival scene is one of the best scenes in the film, as radu slowly approaches the camera and reveals his grinning, slobbering face for the world to see. i found myself cheering him on as he collected victims and taunted his perfect brother. but maybe i\\'m just a sicko. questionable taste in men aside, i highly recommend this film to vampire enthusiasts. it\\'s original, it\\'s fun, and radu is one of the best vampires i\\'ve seen in a long time...much more fun than the stiff, tragic, whining undead brats that endlessly grace the horror screens these days. radu enjoys his sadism and never apologizes. he\\'s what a vampire should be. let me first off say that i am a believer of ghosts, and i do indeed know they exist. i have had enough experiences with them to know they are there. what i hate is the people who bring the bible and religion into all of this. people forget there is more than one \"bible\", thousands of religions and beliefs, and different ways to interpret what is said in the bible. not everyone believes in god, and not everyone believes in stereo-typical religion. religion does not make everything fact, one of the things i should mention in the bible that many do not know is that even the most rampant bible thumper is breaking the very rules written within....you are supposed to never wear more than one fabric at one time, slavery is ok, and you may murder your neighbor under certain circumstances. none of this, \"oh that was the old testament, and now we have the new testament.\" if the bible is the word of god, and cannot be changed..there should be no changes, or versions. religion is full of misinterpretations, mixed facts, and people who so blindly follow it that there, \"is no other way.\" the excuses these said blind followers use are either pathetic, or they themselves cannot explain the discrepancies properly, and instead use excuses handed down to them from either their pastor or teacher. but anyhow, onto the review. i am a decent fan of \"ghost hunters\" and when i heard this show was coming soon, i was pretty excited and thought it had some potential. as much as i like watching \"ghost hunters\", i do not like some of their members, and i do not like the way they can dismiss a place as being haunted, yet cannot explain anything that is going on. just because your investigation equipment does not pick it up, does not mean the camera filming the show did not. i am glad they are skeptical, but it\\'s like they do not understand that just because you did not get anything on your recorder and film does not make the place haunted or not. if ghosts were that easy to capture, it would be known as a fact, not a belief. it\\'s more of a \"right place at the right time\" kind of thing, as well as if there is something there, what makes you think it\\'s going to \"perform\" for you? this show is kind of silly. it\\'s usually boring, and there is lots of talk, lots of psychics, yet hardly anything happens. the main guy\\'s filtered narration is usually either boring to listen to, or is basically not needed. also, the reliance on psychics is too abundant, as i believe very few of them are actually gifted. silvia brown is one i definitely believe in, but most are sometimes hard to believe. i really wanted to like this show, but of the few i have seen i have yet to be terribly impressed. for a long time, \\'the menagerie\\' was my favorite \\'star trek\\' episode though in recent years it has been eclipsed by \\'city on the edge of forever.\\' what i used to prefer about \\'menagerie\\' was that it\\'s more hard-core star trek with this fascinating back-story to the then-current trek storyline. i still think it\\'s fairly ingenious the way gene roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a two-part episode. though the \\'new\\' part of the story is largely an excuse for kirk and a few others (and us) to watch the pilot, the idea of spock being court-martialed is a clever one. you can poke holes in the plot if you want. for instance, given the talosians\\' mind-control abilities and captain pike\\'s condition, why is it even necessary to physically bring pike back to their planet? and there are other confusing questions about pike and commodore mendez... best to not think too hard about the details and just enjoy st\\'s only two-parter. coen brothers-wannabe from writer-director paul chart relies far too much on ideas lifted from other (better) movies, yet does manage to create a creepy atmosphere that keeps one watching. robert forster cuts loose as never before playing a psychopathic psychiatrist (ha ha) who goes on a killing spree in the desert. the film is unusual, but in its attempt to keep one step ahead of the audience, it becomes alienating and off-putting (with a role for amanda plummer that is downright humiliating). an admittedly bravura finale, many quirky bits of business--and forster looking great in the nude--make this a curiosity item, nothing more. veteran movie-director irvin kershner produced, and maybe should directed as well (could paul chart be a pseudonym?). *1/2 from **** when it was released this film caused a sensation. i watched it and was thrilled. beautiful, usually young, naked women filmed in the classy style we knew so well from director hamiltons photography. his photographs never become porn and the same is true for this movie. today i saw it again and was bitterly disappointed. the soft core in extremely slow paced scenes, all filmed with some vaseline on the lenses, actually is all there is. there is no real story, the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed bodies, but they are not real creatures with a soul. actually nothing happens. it is like hamilton is photographing using moving pictures rather than stills. and this gets so boring after a while. i even didn\\'t watch the whole thing the second time, for i fell vast asleep. that is all that remains of this masterpiece: it is a very good sleeping pill. and you will never become addicted to it! back then 7 out of 10, now 3 out of 10 largely forgettable tale in which mercenary kerman & employer agren travel into the jungle in search of agren\\'s missing sister. despite its connection to the cannibal movie family, this film is more of an extreme version of rene cardona\\'s \"guyana - crime of the century\". lenzi clearly aims to exploit the (at that time) topical jonestown massacre, by depicting a rogue, self righteous zealot with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania (played with ruthless intensity by ivan rassimov) leading his motley crew flock into self inflicted oblivion. with sister in toe, kerman & agren attempt to stop the rot, but after several failed coups, they end up fleeing into the \"green inferno\", only to run afoul the locals and their notorious appetites. one in a string of excessive gore fests that emerged in the late seventies/early eighties, where every new addition seemed to engage in a one-upmanship contest with its predecessor, by attempting to contrive the most gory and graphic display ever brought to motion pictures. this inferior instalment employs all the motifs and gimmicks of the others, but with much less success. was it the so called \"amazonian natives\" who looked like they were bollywood rejects (this film was made on location in sri lanka), or the inept \"decapitation\" and \"castration\" scenes that seriously diminished the authenticity that was apparent in \"cannibal holocaust\"? you can decide. without spoiling the conclusion, it appeared as though lenzi put more emphasis in his shock and awe climax than in the basic requirement for a cohesive ending, where all loose ends are resolved. most unsatisfying. as with the others, where the extent of the graphic depictions of violence toward humans is limited (thankfully), the filmmakers have spared no extreme in inflicting the worst possible cruelty on hapless animals in their pursuit of the most sadistic shocks. unfortunately, the only thing shocking about this film is that it rates a mention among others of the ilk, that deal with the subject matter more convincingly. if there are any redeemable features at all, kerman is an affable if somewhat one-dimensional leading man, and his bevy of scantily clad co-stars (agren, lai and senatore) provide some visual respite from the relentless slayings. get smart should be titled get stupid. there is not one funny line or gag in the entire film. this film is so bad it makes the austin powers films look shakespearean. a few more films like this and steve carell can kiss his career goodbye. as for anne hathaway, what is she doing in this film? she\\'s a good actress but is just plain terrible. the writing is pathetically lame. there is not one funny, clever, or witty line. there is not one good sight gag. the directing is terrible. comedy relies on timing. someone should tell the director that. every line that is supposed to be funny (and isn\\'t) is delivered with absolutely the worst sense of comic timing i\\'ve ever seen. 0 stars herculis puaro is, in general, a well established \\'hero\\' we know well from books and movies. this movie or this story don\\'t work and i felt its not agatha\\'s mistake. the cast isn\\'t good, the actors are over exaggerating and making foolish gestures, the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything (even arab clothes) look fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama. the actor playing herculis puaro is doing a nice job but nothing fantastic. the scenes are, as said before, perfect and looking fake. the story is not very enchanting although a mystery of murder but who cares about the death of a loony and vicious blond 45+ woman in the iraqi desert?! the \\'victim\\' is not likable. how can so many blundering decisions can be made. all that waste of resources!its an idiotic story to begin with but theres no need to make it worse.a loose interpretation? are you kidding! it diminishes my regard for voight and coburn.i hope they were paid well. this was by far the worst movie i\\'ve ever seen. and thats compared to alexander, fortress 2 and the new world. i should go back to blockbuster and ask for my money back along with compensation as it was a truly traumatic experience. for the first ten minutes i was changing the zoom on my widescreen tv because the actors seemed to be out of screen. i didn\\'t think it was possible to make such a bad film in this day and age, i was wrong. while typing this message, i\\'ve thought of a good reason to buy this movie. a joke present at xmas. i\\'m blaming the mrs for this one as she picked it, thanks babe. be warned.......a true shocker all round!!!!!! if you\\'ve read mother night and enjoyed it so much (as i did) that you just have to see the movie, understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of vonngut\\'s writing - that beyond his story lies vonnegut himself, and that you can\\'t put a human mind on the screen. his whit and humor just cannot be transcribed by a screenplay or even the best acting performance. i believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that vonnegut poses in his book, but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen. does this mean that the movie misses the mark? of course not. in my opinion, the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book (this is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page). it succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of america\\'s true artistic treasures and presents it in a a framework without pretense. i\\'ve seen other movie versions of vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel vonnegut\\'s genius and loses grip on his own craft. i would not place this movie as one of the best i\\'ve seen, but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching. by taking vonnegut\\'s \"voice\" out of the movie\\'s narration or trying to insert it however it can, mother night tells his story brilliantly, and preserves the story\\'s fundamental lessons without confusion, distraction, or disappointment. this is one of the worst movies, i\\'ve ever seen. not only, that it is a comedy, which isn\\'t funny, but it\\'s also very badly made with an over the top direction full of unnecessary split screens and other effects. the two \"heroes\" with their fantasy language are just annoying and it confused me quite a lot, that they touched each others genitals all the time. but the worst of all that nonsense is the cheap attempt to give that movie some appeal, by referring to german history and to show sensitive aspects of the \"heroes\", which finds its climax in showing how erkan and stefan cure a mentally ill woman with their \"joyful\" lifestyle (!). but i hadn\\'t expect anything better by director michael \"bully\" herbig, who also made two not funny tv-shows, a not funny western movie and a nearly not funny sf-comedy movie. but erkan and stefan had been- just a little- better in some of their stand-up programs. for me the only good thing about the movie is alexandra neldel, who is very beautiful to me. i sat through this on tv hoping because of the names in it that it would be worth the time...but dear gussie, whoever thought this script was worth producing? the basic idea is excellent but the execution is appallingly bad, with a constantly illogical sequence of scenes, an ending that is almost laughably melodramatic and poor rock hudson wanders through this with an understandably confused look on his slightly sagging face. looks like a bad b movie from the 40\\'s... a number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between stewart and novak. she was 25 and he was 50 when this movie was released. i think that the difference didn\\'t matter for a suspense drama like vertigo, but it does matter for a romantic comedy. we can easily understand, that is, why his character would be attracted to hers, but it\\'s less clear why hers would be attracted to his. still, the movie works as a light romantic fantasy. the scene where she stares at him across the cat\\'s head, with her dark painted-on eyebrows flaring and the sounds of her humming and the cat purring, is true magic. it\\'s a little jarring, therefore, when the scene shifts to the top of the flatiron building, and we see the age difference very sharply. as he embraces her, she reaches up to run her fingers through his hair, but stops that motion and just brushes her fingertips lightly against his toupee. family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about. love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about. one man, daddy, has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity. the kids grow up,one all be it, in the hard way, to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is, the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall. all the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances. yes, i shed a tear along the way knowing i had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent. this true to life is one which every young adult, and parent, would do well to see, although some will not realize it until they too are parents. a must see for those who care about their families. the only conceivable flaw of this film is it\\'s title!! please stop comparing it to the first! i did in my previous review only to separate it from the first. if you haven\\'t seen the movie and are curious, totally forget about the first and invent a different name for this. there is nothing alike and has a mood all its own. this is a great exponent of screwy mid-80s comedy. i seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first. anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus. i maintain, the only reason this is in the imdb bottom 100 is because of its title. i usually hate movies like these (i.e. adam sandler, will farrell, farrelly bros....), but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically. i dunno, maybe it\\'s like a bad relationship i can\\'t get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure. either way, this is the single most underrated movie of the 80s behind \\'the stunt man.\\' robert stack- we love you!!! (1919-2003) salva and his pal bigardo have been at the margin of the law during most of their lives. we see them panhandling in a car of the underground, where their pitch to get donations is so lame, no one gives them anything! salva, who is a hardened petty criminal doesn\\'t even have any redeeming qualities, that is, until he discovers a reality show on television that gives him the idea of what to do next. religion and show business prove to be a winning combination, something that salva capitalizes on. he and bigardo have been in jail after the accidental death of a priest that was critical of the duo. salva shows he is a natural for the reality show. he transforms himself into a christ-like figure who is an instant success in the program. espe, who is a no-nonsense woman who is show\\'s producer, can\\'t escape from the way salva pays her unusual attention. ultimately, salva is the victim of his own success in the end. jordi molla, whose first directorial job this movie is, had some success in the way the film satirizes the role of television. spain, which was vulnerable to these types of programs, has seen its share of the bizarre, which is what the director felt is an assault on the viewing public and wanted to set his story from the point of view of the people that are making a fortune out of the naive audience. the ensemble cast has some good moments in the film. mr. molla, like any actor who decides to direct his first feature, would have been more effective concentrating on the picture in front of the camera. candela pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons for watching the movie. juan carlos villedo, david gimenez cacho, franco francescoantonio, florinda chico and the rest responded well to the new director. these kinda movies just don\\'t get the credit they deserve. this is my 2nd all time favorite movie, (stand by me being 1st.) the reason i watched this movie was because wil wheaton was in it and he is my most favorite person in the whole world and i think he done an amazing job in this movie and so did sean astin. i just watched it last night actually and it just amazed me. everything in the movie is very exceptional. the script, the acting, the screenplay. i was on the edge of my seat 80% of the time, and if my mom wasn\\'t in the room i would have absolutely balled whenever joey trotta (wil wheaton) died. i did not see that coming!! at all!! i was real surprised when i heard that it wasn\\'t real popular back in the 90\\'s. i was born a few years after it came out so, of course, i didn\\'t go see it in the theaters, but im sure i would have if i would have been alive. if any of my friends watched this, they would be like, \"uhh okay?\" but thats just cause their not cool enough to appreciate work like this. if you haven\\'t seen this movie, or are wanting to watch something that is the bomb, this is the movie for you to watch. as a big-time prince fan of the last three to four years, i really can\\'t believe i\\'ve only just got round to watching \"purple rain\". the brand new 2-disc anniversary special edition led me to buy it. wow, i was really looking forward to watching it, but i wasn\\'t prepared for just how electric it actually is. prince\\'s musical performances throughout the movie are nothing short of astounding - he really has the moves in this one. i am very familiar (from repeated listens) with the classic \"purple rain\" album and all its songs, but to see them in the context of the movie completely alters your perception of the tunes and lyrics - like computer blue, the beautiful ones, when doves cry and purple rain itself. there is something indescribably hypnotising about the scenes where prince and the revolution perform. the closing songs baby i\\'m a star and i would die for u show how much energy and sheer talent prince was brimming with in his mid-20s (he\\'s overflowing!), it blew me away. it even makes michael jackson seem inanimate even in his peak years. prince shows you how to win the girl of your dreams - drive her to a lake, make her jump in, then drive off - absolutely hilarious stuff in hindsight. some of the scenes are very 1980s and unintentionally hilarious but this adds to the film\\'s overall charm. morris day is the coolest cat on the block (and hilarious), and when his group the time perform the bird you get to see morris day and jerome benton light up the stage minneapolis funk style - i love their dancing in this bit, and how benton provides morris with a mirror mid-performance. i already can\\'t wait to watch it again, i really can\\'t! extras are terrific - particularly seeing a young eddie murphy pre-beverly hills cop admit he is a \"prince groupie\". a good ol\\' boy film is almost required to have moonshine, car chases, a storyline that has a vague resemblance to \"plot\" and at least one very pretty country gal, barefoot with short shorts and a low top. the pretty gal is here (dressed in designer jeans)-- but the redneck prerequisites stop there. jimmy dean is a natural as a sausage spokesman but as a tough guy former sheriff, he comes up way short. big john is big, but he isn\\'t convincing with the \"bad\" part of his moniker. bug-eyed jack elam is a hoot as always and bo hopkins has been playing this same part for decades; ned beatty also does his part in a small role... but there is no story. it smells more like an episode of in the heat of the night than a feature film. cornball cornpone with easily predictable sentiment. perhaps the most glaring problem with this movie is charlie daniels singing the theme. you know the one; it was made famous by... jimmy dean. after several extremely well ratings to the point of superb, i was extremely pleased with the film. the film was dark, moving, the anger, the pain, the guilt and a very extremely convincing demon. i had initially expected to see many special effects, and like a lover\\'s caress, it blew me away with the subtlety and the rightness of it. brian, i am again blown away with your artistry with the telling of the story and your care of the special effects. you will go a long way, my friend. i will definitely be the president of your fan club. eric etebari, the best actor award, was the number one choice. you made jr. lopez look like a child compared to kasadya. :) overall, the acting, story line, the high quality filming and awesome effects, it was fantastic. i just wish it were longer. i am looking forward to the dreamless with extremely high expectations. but it is kinda hilarious, at least if you grew up on weird al, like i did. it\\'s a mockumentary about his life and career, beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins. it\\'s uneven in places, but some of the segments are still very funny, particularly when he goes to japan. although it\\'s not quite as emotionally textured as lost in translation, and he doesn\\'t find love however fleeting, he does capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is tokyo street life. perhaps weird al isn\\'t recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he is; perhaps a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet. still, this is a funny movie. one of the two best films of the year. a well filmed, well written, well put together film with an outstanding cast. lau ching wan and his friends (dayo wong chi wa, anthony wong chau sun, francis ng chun yu, jordan chan siu chun, cheung man tat) had great chemistry before the film and their friendship shows in their performances. theresa lee plays her comedic role well (though much like a female version of michael wong, her gag seems to be the foreign born chinese surrounded by native hkers.), and i found myself cheering for innovative explosive scenes, something i haven\\'t done since 1. the fan boys took over alt.asian-movies and 2. john woo\\'s hardboiled. sure the ending was expected, but i feel better cheering for cops than a bunch of young gang members. highly enjoyable. i managed to see this at the new york international film festival in november 2005 with my boyfriend. we were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving. it was very well directed with strong imagery. the visual effects were amazing - especially for a short. it had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic: this film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father. there is also a surprise twist at the end which caught me off guard. this leans towards the gothic feel. i would love to see this as a full feature film. -- carrie why else would he do this to me? not that i expect dean cain to produce hit movies. or even decent movies. i saw lois and clark, i am aware of just how... \"good\" dean cain is. obviously this is gonna be a cheesey flick, and each cheesey flick has its own special way to make you scratch your head. i will not call these spoilers as you can\\'t really spoil this movie any more than it already is. to begin with... why is that a fake helicopter? i mean... why? how come that one scientist is from chicago and that other scientist is from la and neither one could be any more eastern european if they tried? how hard would it have been to get either an american actor, or just change that lame state sheet the movie provides us with to say those people aren\\'t american? why are there 2 occasions when the movie gives us a slug line? we get helipad-day and then mess hall-day later on. and then that\\'s it, who cares about the timeline. to be honest, who cared about it even when they mentioned it, but i guess that\\'s beside the point. does a movie really get better if you are able to view it through multiple split screens? the answer is no. that dragon sure can walk down that hall..over..and over...and over....and over... who on earth was responsible for one of the worst endings in film history? it was straight out of scooby doo. oh, the dragon\\'s dead now...say, wanna get dinner? sure, but not at some chinese place....with dragon in the name!! ah ha ha ha!! ha ha ha!! haha ha! i used to be superman! aha ha ha! ha ha! fade to black my god, it made me cringe it was so stupid. but never fear..even though the whole building exploded...and no one was left alive..for some reason there\\'s a second untouched, unmanned lab that survived pretty well, so they can make a sequel. hurray for us all. minimal script, minimal character development, minimal steady camera. maximum stretched scenes, maximum headache inducing jerky zooms, maximum characters walking around in the woods doing nothing. up until the time flashes on the screen of 12:01pm, you can fast forward and miss nothing, since there are three hunters who we know nothing about doing nothing. to be fair, the movie does have some string music that was interesting, so perhaps a music video would have been the way to go with this. unfortunately that was not to be, and what should have been a twenty minute short is stretched beyond belief. forget about \"trigger man\", i know i am trying to. - merk a wonderful film ahead of its time, i think so, in the eighty\\'s it was all about winning, greed is good ? remember that one ? i have seen this film more that 20 times, to me this is a real desert island film, i keep watching because there is always something more to learn about these flawed characters that i just love, jessica tandy, and hume cronin, are simply wonderful,also beverly d\\'angelo, beau bridges come in at a close second, don\\'t get me wrong there are many more great performance\\'s in this film, and it is also the way it is written that made it for me, and i hope you, a film that you will want to see over and over, i think tv shows like \"northen exposure\", and now \"earl\" owe a lot to this film. but remember it is not a tom cruise film. it got switched off before the opening credits had even finished appearing. the first joke was just so appallingly lame and dreadfully acted that it had to go. you shouldn\\'t really decide to watch this based on my review or not. i saw so little of it i shouldn\\'t even really be commenting but suddenly it all became clear why the video shop guy was sniggering at us paying money to see it. couldn\\'t they have just made earnest does dallas? this is one of the more unromantic movies i have ever seen. casting: richard gere is just too old looking for romantic lead roles anymore. diane looks a bit eager to please and frowning as usual but she seems unconvinced by the romance herself. supporting cast not too memorable. story: the medical drama he has to deal with is unconvincing and is not interesting. the story is weak - not enough happens to make a movie about. there is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here. the setting is a little bleak and the house it is set in is unattractive. not destined to be a great one to remember. (only light spoilers in here) stealing sinatra is a half-slapstick comedy about dimwit kidnappers, dimwit victims, and a few other side-stories thrown in to eat up some time. you will see some poor performances all around in this movie. the drama is forced, and the humor makes no sense. whether you\\'re watching the kidnappers threaten the victim who won\\'t shut up, or a victim\\'s father responding to the criminal\\'s death threat with \"care for some tea?\", none of it is believable. this quite comfortably fits into the \"wannabe movie\" category. you will also be listening to a repetitive goofy music track throughout pretty much the entire movie. it\\'s quite unprofessional, and adds nothing. it\\'s really just a sad attempt at making an achingly unfunny movie seem somewhat witty. however, if you\\'re able to look past all of this and suspend a lot of disbelief, you might be entertained by the adequate storyline. i voted 4/10. yes, this is one of those movies, so terrible, so insipid, so trite, that you will not be able to stop laughing. i have watched comedies, good comedies, and laughed less than my wife and i laughed at this movie. the other comments give the idea well enough. the characters are so unpleasant you cheer the rats on, the effects are so poorly done you wonder whose elementary school art class was in charge, the acting-- oh the acting-- talk about tired dialogue and embarrassing pauses. but the rat, yes, the big rat. why we didn\\'t get to see the rat until the end rather surprised me. often the \\'big one\\' isn\\'t shown until the end because the budget is limited and good effects chew up so much money. i surmise, however, that in this case the big rat was hidden until the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a guy running around dressed up like a woodchuck with third-world dentistry. the most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene. after figuring out that the rats couldn\\'t stand loud noise (migraines from the bad acting?), the main dude rigs up a fire alarm to send the rats into a frenzy. if you\\'ve ever wanting to see a pair of rats waltz while blood squirts out of their heads like a geyser, this film is for you. really, you need to rent it and see for yourself. but not for more than 99â¢, ok? well where do i begin my story?? i went to this movie tonight with a few friends not knowing more than the actors that were in it, and that it was supposed to be a horror movie. well i figured out within the first 20 minutes, what a poor decision i had made going out seeing this movie. the plot was crap, and so was the script. the lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically. the cast couldn\\'t have been more plastic looking. even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much quicker...like they dragged on for no particular reason. very poor editing. all in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money. boo. this is one of my favorites. betty white and leslie neilson sparkle in this romantic comedy. one is a business executive who re-evaluates life based on the expectation of her death within a year. the other is a playboy who has tired of gold-digging young women and seeks a relationship with a vital, mature woman. if you\\'ve got silver in your hair and/or romance in your heart, microwave the popcorn, curl up with your honey, and prepare yourself for a treat. following directly from where the story left off in part one, the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man\\'s legacy is exactly as such. in direct contrast to the first feature, part two represents a shift from che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country, to cheâ—struggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties. the change of setting isn\\'t just aesthetic; from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature, replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical, battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle. yet, as che would go on to say himselfâ—such a struggle is best told exactly as thatâ—a struggle. while part one certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that, part two takes a much more refined, callous and bleak segment of che\\'s life and ambition, and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible, easy to grasp manner. while the movie\\'s tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from part one however, there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible. this somewhat distant, cold approach to telling che\\'s story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off; indeed, i still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one manâ—if anything, the entirety of che, taken as a whole, delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man\\'s struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way. by no means does soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what hirschbiegel did with der untergang half a decade ago (excuse the ironic contrast); che is a slow moving, reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who â–arguably- conducted the whole thing. yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of cuba and retreating to the bleak, decaying backdrop of bolivia for part two, the story does inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that doesn\\'t feel too disjointed from its predecessor, but does enough to give it its own reference points. here, the basic structure of part one is echoed backâ—there\\'s the initial struggle, the battles, the fallen comrades and the recruiting of those to replace them, all the while we see some glimpses of the man behind the movement. yet, as anyone with the vaguest idea of the actual history behind the feature will know, part two is destined to end on a much more underwhelming, and disquieting note. this difference, in combination with the similarities to part one, make a compelling and memorable whole; by all means, both could be digested one their own (and kudos to soderbergh for achieving as such) and enjoyed as they are, but taken as one statement, che delivers exactly what it sets out to achieve. indeed, everything that made part one the treat that it was one month prior is still evident here from the subtle yet engrossing performances from the central cast to the slow building, realistically structured combat scenesâ—the drama inherent to the characters on screen is just as vague and indiscernible, but with a feature such as this, part two once again proves that avoiding such elements don\\'t necessarily hurt a film when there is enough plot and reflection on other elements to keep the viewer engaged. in fact, upon writing this review i was at odds as to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for part one, and title the review as a whole, yet i felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both films consecutively. with that said, i cannot rightfully decree whether or not che holds up to the task of engaging an audience for its sprawling four hour plus runtime, but upon viewing both segments i can at least attest to each part\\'s ability to do just that. with a reflective, intricate screenplay combined with endlessly mesmerising photography and nuanced performances that do justice to the movie\\'s characters without drawing attention to themselves, che part two is every bit as compelling and rewarding as its predecessor, but this time with a tragic but uplifting, reaffirming conclusion fit for the history pages of film. - a review by jamie robert ward (http://www.invocus.net) sometimes it\\'s hard to be a pirate...............but by golly miss jean peters has a lot of fun trying - and it shows,particularly during her first spot of friendly swordplay with blackbeard (mr thomas gomez - eminently hissable)when the sheer joy of performing is plain on her face. with fifty years of hindsight feminists seem intent on grabbing this movie as some sort of an anthem for the empowerment of women in a male - dominated society but i have serious doubts that either m.tourneur or miss peters had any such concept in their heads at the time. it was an exciting,entertaining family film with absolutely no pretensions,hidden meanings or alternative agenda.it was fun. m.louis jourdan is both winsome and treacherous as her love interest. mr herbert chapman is wise and philosophical as the wise and philosophical doctor.mr james robertson justice is just a tad unbelievable as the bosun. but it is miss peters who stays in the memory.wilfully adolescent,illiterate,tough but vulnerable,wonderfully agile,and ultimately,courageous,she is everybody\\'s idea of a lady pirate. there was a definite window of opportunity for her in feisty costume roles - that she did not choose to seize it is a matter of some regret. i had never seen a film by john cassavetes up until two years ago, when i first saw the killing of a chinese bookie in a berlin cinema, which i found interesting, to put it diplomatically, but not so special, i instantly wanted to see more of his work. since then, i tried - with an emphasis on tried - watching his other work, shadows in particular. i must admit, it took me a a while before i actually enjoyed the film. at first the unpolished, raw and improvised way cassavetes it was shot, put me off somewhat and i thought of it as an original - absolutely - but flawed and dated experiment. but now, upon reviewing, these little imperfections make it look so fresh, even today. shot on a minimal budget of $40,000 with a skeleton six person crew, shadows offers an observation of the tensions and lives of three siblings in an african-american family in which two of the three siblings, ben (ben carruthers) and lelia (lelia goldoni), are light-skinned and able to pass for white. cassavetes demanded that the actors retain their real names to reflect the actual conflicts within the group but saw the film as being concerned with human problems as opposed imply to racial ones. cassavetes shot the film in ten minute takes and jagged editing, a reaction against \\'seamless\\' hollywood production values. cassavetes main inspiration - at least in the cinematic style the film was shot - were the italian neo-realists whilst also professing admiration for welles\\' pioneering spirit. the use of amateurs and improvisation might resemble some of the italian neo-realist directors, but with his bebop score by charles mingus ans shafi hadi, the film feels very different, very american, unlike anything made before really. the song with the feathered girls, \"i feel like a lolly-pop\" (or something) feels like light years back to me, ancient history. but no matter how dated it might look, it still makes a delightful time capsule of late fifties new york today. i think it\\'s this is one of the first films made aspiring filmmakers realize they could shoot an independent film, without hollywood, improvised and without a real budget. seymour cassel, who acted and was involved in shadows, claims it was jules dassin\\'s the naked city (1948) that was the first and inspired them all, but i think this was the one that really opened the eyes of aspiring independent american filmmakers. camera obscura --- 8/10 based on an actual story, john boorman shows the struggle of an american doctor, whose husband and son were murdered and she was continually plagued with her loss. a holiday to burma with her sister seemed like a good idea to get away from it all, but when her passport was stolen in rangoon, she could not leave the country with her sister, and was forced to stay back until she could get i.d. papers from the american embassy. to fill in a day before she could fly out, she took a trip into the countryside with a tour guide. \"i tried finding something in those stone statues, but nothing stirred in me. i was stone myself.\" suddenly all hell broke loose and she was caught in a political revolt. just when it looked like she had escaped and safely boarded a train, she saw her tour guide get beaten and shot. in a split second she decided to jump from the moving train and try to rescue him, with no thought of herself. continually her life was in danger. here is a woman who demonstrated spontaneous, selfless charity, risking her life to save another. patricia arquette is beautiful, and not just to look at; she has a beautiful heart. this is an unforgettable story. \"we are taught that suffering is the one promise that life always keeps.\" this pm entertainment production is laced with enough bullets to make john woo say, \"enough already!\" of course, it isn\\'t nearly as beautiful as woo can deliver but it gets the exploitive job done in 90 minutes. eric phillips (don wilson) is an undercover cop in the near future. when his wife is framed for murdering the governor by a team using a look-a-like cyborg, it is up to eric to clear her name. wilson gets to pull van damme duty as he plays the heroic lead and his evil cyborg doppelganger. why the academy failed to take notice is beyond me. being a pm production, there are tons of car chases, exploding cars (4 in the first 5 minutes!) and shoot outs. i particularly liked the van that flips in midair before it even comes close to touching an exploding truck. my other favorite bit involved a neighborhood girl coming over to perfect her karate in don\\'s simulator. it is merely a chance to show off some cheapo lawnmower man effects circa 1995. shallow grave begins with either a tribute or a rip off of the shower scene in psycho. (i\\'m leaning toward rip off.) after that it gets worse and then surprisingly gets better, almost to the point of being original. bad acting and amateurish directing bog down a fairly interesting little story, but the film already surpasses many in the \"yankee comes down south to get killed by a bunch of rednecks\" genre because it is actually shot in the south. a group of college girls head to ft. lauderdale for summer vacation and are waylaid in georgia by a flat tire after getting off the main road. (note to yankees: stay on the highway when you go to florida.) sue ellen (lisa stahl) has to pee so she heads into the woods. when she finally finds a good spot to do her business she witnesses the local sheriff (tony march) strangle his mistress (merry rozelle) to death. (note to yankees: do not wander off into the woods when in the south; not because you might witness a murder, but you may run across a marijuana plantation.) this is the point where the story, not the movie, actually comes close to being good. while tony march will never have to practice his oscar speech, his sheriff dean becomes a creepy facsimile of a normal guy torn by what he has done and what he must do. tom law is likable as deputy scott and is as authentic a southern deputy as i\\'ve seen since walton goggins (deputy steve naish) in house of 1000 corpses. a few scenes in the movie are worth the mention. the girls stop at a bbq in south carolina and display their racism when a big black guy checks them out. sue ellen runs into a barn to hide behind some hay bales and in a shockingly realistic moment a large snake is hiding in the hay with her. and in the strangest scene, sheriff dean makes like he\\'s about to rape patty (carol cadby) and tells her to take off her clothes. dean has turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what he\\'s about to do. the preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his bible. his sermon is about how jezebel is saved by the blood of jesus christ. i feel sorry for this preacher\\'s flock. jezebel was in the old testament a few thousand years before christ was born and by no means is she one of the five people you are going to meet in heaven. although this film has had a lot of praise, i personally found it boring. there are some nice brasilian sunsets and the characters are believable, but the story of how they interrelate, even if very unusual by our standards, is not interesting enough to sustain a movie this long. the central woman takes up with one man after another in a close knit way and putting the interests of her children first. as the tolerance of the various men is stretched, we see their characters develop. the story unfolds with dignity and aided by excellent acting. it is a rare glimpse into the brasilian hinterland, far from the city, but hardly exciting enough to keep one\\'s eyes open for. no mention if ann rivers siddons adapted the material for \"the house next door\" from her 1970s novel of the same title, or someone else did it. this lifetime-like movie was directed by canadian director jeff woolnough. having read the book a long time ago, we decided to take a chance when the film showed on a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television. you know that when the critical moments precede the commercials, which of course, one can\\'t find in this version we watched. the film\\'s star is lara flynn boyle who sports a new look that threw this viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation this actress has gone through. from the new eyebrows to other parts of her body, ms. boyle is hardly recognizable as col kennedy, the character at the center of the mystery. this was not one of the actress better moments in front of the camera. that goes for the rest of the mainly canadian actors that deserved better. the film has a feeling of a cross between \"desperate houswives\" with \"the stepford wives\" and other better known features, combined with a mild dose of creepiness. the best thing about the movie was the house which serves as the setting. meticulously constructed and perfectly played, to the ends of the earth is a simply astonishing voyage out of our reality and into another age. based on william golding\\'s trilogy, these three 90-minute films chronicle the journey towards both australia and experience of youthful aristocrat edmund talbot (benedict cumberbatch) aboard an aging man o\\' war in the early 19th century as he heads for a government position down under. among the crew and hopeful emigrants sharing his passage are a tempestuous, bullying captain (jared harris), a politically radical philosopher (sam neill), a canny 1st lieutenant who\\'s worked his way up from the bottom (jamie sives) and, fleetingly, the first brush of love in the form of a beautiful young woman (joanne page) whose ship literally passes in the night. quite aside from the astonishing degree of physical historic accuracy, director david attwood and screenwriters tony basgallop and leigh jackson have a canny eye and ear for the manners and stiff etiquette of an earlier time, crafting a totally convincing microcosm of the napoleonic era. shipboard life is one brutal, monotonous round of seasickness, squalor and danger after another and as edmund becomes entangled in the loves, hopes and miseries of his fellow passengers he experiences a delirious whirl of life\\'s hardships, man\\'s inhumanities and his noblest sentiments. those who enjoyed master and commander: the far side of the world or patrick o\\'brian\\'s series of novels on which it was based will love this â– for everyone else, it\\'s a whole new world to discover. wow. this is really not that good. i would like to agree with the others in that at least the acting is good... it is, but it is nothing special. the movie is so precictable and i for one am sick of receiving culture info through movies. */**** i have to point out, before you read this review, that in no way, is this a statement against iranian people ... if you really want to read something into it, than hopefully you see, that i\\'m against politicians in general ... but if you\\'re looking to be offended ... i can\\'t help you! not in iran as this movie is banned there (see imdb trivia for this movie). which is a shame, because the movie is great. would it not be for \"grbavica\", this movie would have won at the international film festival in berlin. rightfully so (it was the runner-up, or second place if you will). why? because it is a movie about oppression. it\\'s not even that this is a complete women issue. it is about the government trying to keep the people down. an analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the movie. but by banning it nothing is resolved and/or can they make this movie disappear! another reviewer had a great summary line: \"comedy about a tragedy\", that sums it up pretty well! i know little or nothing about astronomy, but nevertheless; i was, at first, a little sceptical about the plot of this movie. it follows three children that were all born during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion, and thus (naturally) become ruthless serial killers. the plot does sound ridiculous at first, but once you realise that a solar eclipse blocks out saturn and, as you know, saturn is the emotion planet, it all falls into place; makes complete sense and it\\'s then that you know you aren\\'t simply watching another silly 80\\'s slasher with a pea brain plot. thank god for that! seriously, though, bloody birthday is based on a ridiculous premise, but it more than makes up for that with it\\'s originality. having a bunch of kids going round slaughtering people may not be the most ingenious masterstroke ever seen in cinema, but when given the choice between this and another dull friday the 13th clone - i know what i\\'d choose. also helping the film out of the hole that some people would think it\\'s silly plot dug it into is the fact that it\\'s extremely entertaining. many slashers become formulaic far too quickly and the audience ends up watching simply to see some gore. this film, however, keeps itself going with some great creepy performances from the kids (which harks back to creepy kid classics such as village of the damned), a constant stream of sick humour and a small, but impressive for the type of film, dose of suspense and tension. one thing that i liked a lot about this movie was the vast array of weaponry. there\\'s nothing worse than a slasher where the killer uses the same weapon over and over again (cough halloween cough), but that\\'s not the case here as bloody birthday finds room for everything from skipping ropes to bow and arrows. there wasn\\'t any room for a chainsaw, which is a huge shame, but i suppose not every film can have a chainsaw in it. after many, many years i saw again this beautiful love story, thinking about how would i, half a century after, react to a film which made so many girls cry and sigh at that time, when i was just an male adolescent trying to understand women\\'s behaviors, in a small city in brazil. this time, however, what caught my attention in the film was something very different, namely the insistence with which the physician dr. han suyin (jennifer jones) makes clear to the journalist mark elliott (william holden) her special ethically condition as an eurasian. in fact, she is constantly putting emphasis on this point in their relationship, repeating she is willing to assume her love for him and carry it on in a \"occidental way\", provided that, by doing so, she is not betraying her chinese side. its seems to the spectator that suyin is eagerly making efforts to establish a very subtle conciliation between those two unstable and opposite aspects of her culture, for they will immediately engage in overt conflict in her mind at a minimum failure in her attempts to control them. therefore, suyin\\'s attitudes always leave poor elliott â– a determined, brave and extremely practical man â– anxious and perplexed, without knowing how much importance to give to her words. for him, whose love for her is plain and simple, the situation is totally clear: if we love each other, let us make a couple and begin immediately a life together. \"not so fast\", is what she seems, verbally and non-verbally, to answer him all the time. in fact, suyin\\'s chinese portion would never allow her such a level of pragmatism. and, as she goes on and on reinforcing this much aimed equilibrium between those two worlds inside herself, she also frequently signals to him that also a very peculiar trait of chinese culture is deeply rooted in her mind, namely the constant \"raids\" on the real world by invisible beings from an spiritual or non-physical world. for suyin is always alerting elliott about how dangerous is life, not because of any objective and concrete threat (as would be the perpetuation of the english colonialism or the eminence of a japanese invasion), but due to the threats of plenty of cruel and harmful gods and other mystical and mythical beings over the poor, fearful and vulnerable human beings. in fact, it looks like a whole bunch of chinese deities are permanently on the watch to make people\\'s life totally miserable. because of that, mothers must dress their precious male babies in girls clothes, so that they are not taken away by jealous gods; everyone should always be ready to make loud noises to send the clouds away, in order to avoid their covering the sight of the moon; peasants are advised that they should shout loudly \"the rice is bad! the rice is bad!\" to protect their crops from being stolen by deities; and, in a funeral, it is recommended that the dead\\'s family be isolated from the other people by curtains, so that the gods don\\'t take advantage of their sorrow and fragility. in other words, suyin introduces us to a culture in which the supernatural has a real existence, as if a rather disturbing pantheon of malign and sadistic gods are always on the verge of negatively interfering with the most banal acts in anyone\\'s daily life. as the story takes place in hong kong in 1949, it should be clear that china really was, at that time, almost a semi-feudal society, while the country from which elliott had come from was not yet dominated by the fierce capitalism that, launched by the usa after the first oil shock in 1973, took charge of the whole world. therefore, at least in one aspect, both sides of suyin\\'s eurasian personality were still much more innocent than they would be today. a lot of history came into being since those old days. as to china, the main fact is that, after several phases of a communist regime, the country finally reached, in the last two decades, the condition of a very aggressive economy much more properly described as state capitalism. and, what happened to that old spirituality that so much enthralled suyin in hong kong, in 1949, and with which she used to impress so much an impassioned elliott, under that tree on the hill behind the hospital? it is gone, completely gone! in brief, if that story took place today, elliott would not find it necessary to go to china to propose to suyin in the presence of the third uncle and her entire family. in fact, both men would now be incomparably closer to one another, in their huge pragmatism, talking business as usual! first and foremost i would like to say, that before i watched this film i considered myself an accepting individual. someone that cared about others, appreciated others, found no/barely any judgment against other people, and this film has (i think) changed my life or viewpoint dramatically. when i watched it, i didn\\'t know particularly what it was about, i knew it was about some type of forbidden relationship, but other then that i was clueless, and as i began to see what was taking place between these two wonderfully depicted characters, i was in shock, disbelief, confusion and surprise. the first time i watched it, i was blind. blind to their love, to their intimacy, to their connection, to their pureness as human beings, to their relationship. i watched it a second time, because i finally figured out how hypocritical i was being, saying to myself and others, \"oh i accept all types of people, and try not to judge them\" while still judging this wonderful and amazingly insightful story, because of my fear i suppose. the second time i watched this film, i opened those eyes of mine that had stayed closed the first time, and really looked, not at the type of taboo relationship part that i\\'d heard about all my life, but simply at two human beings in love. and i loved it, i loved the storyline, i loved the slightly broken yet strong individual people in the film, i loved the sharing of feelings, and i loved the strong bonds created. it is a really eye opening, beautifully done film that made me cry at times, and i hope that people who read this and are going to watch the film eventually, remember that everyone deserves love, no matter what shape or form it is presented in.... \"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz\"! if imdb would allow one-word reviews, that\\'s what mine would be. this film was originally intended only for kids and it would seem to be very tough going for adults or older kids to watch the film. the singing, the story, everything is dull and washed out--just like this public domain print. like other comedy team films with roots in traditional kids stories (such as the awful snow white and the three stooges and the overrated babes in toyland), this movie has limited appeal and just doesn\\'t age well. now that i think about it, i seriously doubt that many kids nowadays would even find this film enjoyable! so my advice is don\\'t watch this film. if you must watch an abbott and costello film, almost any other one of their films (except for a&c go to mars) would be an improvement. once in a while, a movie will sweep along that stuns you, draws you in, awes you, and, in the end, leaves you with a renewed belief in the human race from the artistry form. this is not it. this is an action movie that lacks convincing action. it stinks. rent something else. hard to imagine this film is based on a true story, and how christy managed to accomplish the miracle is so heart-stirring. daniel day-lewis is a chameleon, really hard to imagine how much effort he had done to create this disabled character. watching him on screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience. the movie is not so pessimistic as i thought before, the story is kinda bright and intriguing. christy is not despised by the normals, his life is also colorful and delightful, although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful fetter through his eyes. one important factor of christy\\'s success is his mother\\'s support which seems to be more touching, and the unknown actress brenda fricker also deserves her oscar award for this role, this fat little middle-aged woman uses her all to make christy\\'s dream come true. so lucky for christy!and hugh o\\'conor is also excellent as young christy, what a performance for a child! the love story of christy is very well-done, trustful. christy wants love and nothing can derive him of the right to love, his crush on the beautiful dr. eileen cole (surprisingly played by fiona shaw, i am deeply impressed with her role in harry potter series, the loathsome aunt petunia, so her appearance in this role is really beyond my mind, but anyway, any woman has her own youth...) is paranoiac and offensive, i do have sympathy for him, love is a two-edged sword, happiness and agony are just next to each other. btw, jim sheridan\\'s works are all good (in america, the boxer etc.) except get rich or die trying\\', god knows why he chose to direct that crap! really a career taint for him, what a pity! i\\'m stunned that the reviewers @ imdb gave this tv film as a high a rating as they did. it\\'s an innocuous, sweet, uncomplicated clichã©\\' of a film that had two big names from the past in it (both of whom did a decent job), but this film reeks of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the lesser cable channels. i like a good romance as well as anyone, but as my wife and i were watching this--and before we saw the rating-we said, \"there are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because there\\'s nothing in it to challenge their brains, their faith, their comfort level or their cultural preferences. it\\'s possible to make a good film like that (and away from her is an example), but this was amateur hour. there are some quite good films rated much lower than this one. truly, another in a long line of woefully inadequate holiday films. watch the family stone. it\\'s miles ahead of this schlock. do a title search on randolph scott and trail street is the one film missing from the list you\\'ve seen. one of 4 films scott made at rko during his prime (1947) the others are always easy to get. liberal, kansas is just southwest of dodge city and is a powder-keg about to explode between the trail-riders who drive the longhorns into trail street, the town\\'s main street, and the sod-busters who feed our bellies. it\\'ll take a strong man like bat masterson to step between the two groups and bring the town to order. more i won\\'t say, except that scott movies usually have just one pretty girl and this one has three. randolph scott always played men you could look up to for their sense of honor, courage, level-headedness and willingness to do the right thing. fifty years ago parents could send their kids to a scott movie with confidence they\\'d learn positive values. robert ryan co-stars in this film, playing a good guy for a change. in real life, ryan was one of the many world war ii heros who starred in america\\'s movies. how sad what we get these days. george clooney teaches our young that we ought sympathize with suicide bombers, while steven spielberg teaches there is no moral difference between the olympic athletes murdered in 1972 in munich and the palestinian terrorists who killed them. hollywood 2005 derives their moral compass from too much cocaine and too much commitment to the wacky left. i wonder how all this plays out in liberal, kansas. liberal, after all, was not a dirty word 150 years ago when the city was named. i went to see this one with much expectation. quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest. even a child can see the missing logic to character\\'s behaviors. today\\'s kids need creative stories which would inspire them, which would make them \\'daydream\\' about the events. that\\'s precisely what happened with movies like e.t. and star wars a decade ago. (how many kids imagined about becoming jedi knights and igniting their own lightsabers?) seriously don\\'t waste your time & money on this one. *sigh* leave it to us finns to take a stupid idea, blow it out of proportion and try to market it as cool. lordi is a mediocre band at best, and a single gimmick will get you only so far. to all you marketing idiots out there: this is the reason for the inherent minority complex that is often encountered when finland tries to export something. lordi isn\\'t scary. lordi is lame. lordi is over. i want to apologize to the rest of the world for this plastic-faced idiocy. sure, they won the eurovision. no, wait - they won the eurovision. that\\'s it. i rest my case. after the highs of darkplace it was never conceivable that holness and adobye would be able to create anything half as good as garth marengi. yet i think that man to man in its own right is as good a show (on the good episodes) as darkplace. i cant argue that 2 of the episodes really are\\'nt that good but the other 4 certainly make up for it. if i had to pick 2 great episodes id go for formula4 driver steve pising (pronounced pissing) and the great garth marengi. to already have a bit of understanding of the programme is a real plus as dean learner makes many inside jokes but even if you have\\'nt seen much dean id recommend this as some of the rants he launches into are genius ie. his argument with def lepord over their name. all in all a great show which just misses full marks because of the couple of less funny episodes. i saw this movie in a theater while on vacation in pablo co. i had just quit my biomedical engineering job at a hospital. i consider the script to be a exaggeration of the real type of stuff that goes on in hospitals. the idiots that put it down on production value don\\'t get the point and probably have never been hospitalized. and never worked in one for sure. billy jack (same era) was very poorly produced but had a significant social comment and was a very good movie with a real social message. i have ever since been looking for this movie this is the first site i have found where it get mentioned. i caught this on television one day when i was young and loved it. in the 1970\\'s, there were a bunch of lame comedies that tried too hard to be be funny so it this was a nice surprise. it\\'s one of the best comedies of the 1970\\'s and the definitive summer camp comedy thanks to murrary\\'s excellent comedic performance, which still stands as one of his greatest. this is the film that really got ivan reitman noticed as a director. reitman proves with this movie that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time. while this film is hilarious and meatballs 2 is so bad that it\\'s fun, meatballs 3 and meatballs 4 are absolutely dreadful. recommended for those who enjoyed stripes and ghostbusters. the film\\'s design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country (u.s.). we see relationships all over at the university setting for the film. befittingly, the obvious of student v.s. teacher is present. but what the film adds to its value is its other relationships: male v.s. female, white v.s. black, and the individual v.s. society. but most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v.s. himself. i was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus. most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other. this film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides. it did not attempt to show how either was right, although i would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive (quite obvious towards the end). the film also discusses sex and rape. it is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together, for a time. lawrence fishburne does an over-the-top performance as the sagacious profesor phipps. he crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down-trodden with the industrious and positive. other stars that make this film are omar epps, ice cube, and jennifer connelly. michael rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance. tyra banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act. higher learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper. in fact, i would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other, rather than some dry book, as the real education at a university. it is a life-learning process, not a textual one. i think you\\'ll find \"higher learning\" is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general. 8/10 is rich, ailing elizabeth taylor courting the angel of death on her island fortress in the mediterranean, or is she just overreacting--or more precisely, overacting--as usual? actually, both are applicable in director joseph losey\\'s wandering, meandering mess called \"boom\", appropriately titled since tempers in the lush, luxurious setting are nearly ready to explode. richard burton climbs taylor\\'s mountain uninvited; she dresses him in a samurai\\'s robe complete with saber. though great-looking in widescreen, the picture is otherwise quite deadly, a failure even liz \\'n dick-philes should shun (the stars\\' collective \"what the hell!\" attitude to their late-\\'60s film careers reached an ego-mad nadir here). pointless, confused, and maddening, \"boom\" is a catastrophe--although screenwriter tennessee williams, who adapted his own unsuccessful play \"the milk train doesn\\'t stop here anymore\", was said to be quite fond of it! * from **** i can\\'t even describe it. it\\'s the worst movie i\\'ve ever seen (i\\'m being a nice guy when i call it movie).just another big-budget-made-to-someone-who-doesn\\'t-like-to-think-much.it\\'s not even scary. it\\'s revolting when there are great movies that never reach the big screen and then comes this...\"thing\" to trick movie fans. i guess big producers make whatever they want. just get a big producer, hot chicks (allthough horrible actresses) and a ton of horror movie clichã©s and cook it for a week or so, and you\\'ll get \"the nun\". and i thought bad boys 2 was horrible!!!! the screenplay is the worst part of this film, as it lurches from one premise to the next, missing all the important bits that would have made a number of different stories possible. (this film is confusing, because the audience doesn\\'t know what the story is.) i had no problem with the low-production values and the acting wasn\\'t great, but this is telly, so it was fine. i don\\'t mind if some scenes looked like they were done in one take. but having such a non-sensical screenplay is completely unnecessary. did any executive actually read it before forking out the cash? avoid this at all costs. the prologue in particular was so poorly written, it needed a voice-over to fill in all the details that had been left out. the prologue was rushed, it wasn\\'t clear what was happening, ie. the russian revolution was reduced to \"some riots are happening in petersburg\", with the next scene being soldiers arresting them. i know the basic history of the revolution, so i could fill in the details, \"those pesky communists\". the prologue is best ignored. this could have been a thoughtful study of a person who is confused about who she is. it sets up this premise in the asylum. it could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the film. no. gone. the film assumes she is who she says she is (even though there is still no empirical evidence.) it sets up a melodramatic romance, a love so strong, it\\'ll believe anything she says. okay, a soppy romance. no, because it makes no sense. the love interest seems like a crazed (and incidentally, sleazy) lunatic, bursting out in wild gestures. this also doesn\\'t work, because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end. they never got married and she returned to america. the love story collapses. despite there being plenty of love scenes, i was never convinced of the reason that they were in love. i find rom-com romances more convincing, despite there only being one or two scenes which establish that they\\'ve even spent any time with each other. it could have been a thriller-type thing where the film assumes she is who she says she is, and she struggles to prove her identity. no, the court case is summed up rather than dealt with. the bizarre voice over comes back, again to fill in the details of a better film. the funniest thing to consider is what really happened. anna anderson was a loony who went to america and married another loony and they did crazy things together. throughout her life, she had bouts of lunatic behaviour. none of this in the film either. there\\'s a really annoying character in the asylum who crops up from nowhere and announces herself as a \\'one flew over the cuckoo\\'s next/\\'twelve monkeys\\'-type informant. thankfully, she vanishes, having brought nothing to the story. lady and the tramp ii: scamp\\'s adventure i think is a good movie but i think the first lady and the tramp movie is better because it is the original and i would think that the original movies compared to the sequeals is better. lady and the tramp ii takes off after the original, but this time it\\'s junior\\'s turn, lady and tramp\\'s youngster (scamp) always hates been treated with the things that has to be done with him, following the rules in the house, taking baths all the time and taking things nice and easy, scamp gets angry and runs away with a pack of dogs that are left off the loose. scamp meets another dog called angel, they both get along fine and do the things scamp\\'s mother and father did, having an italian meal (spagetthi and meatballs etc:)afterwards, scamp realises that he is loved by his family especial his pal, which is the baby, scamp comes back and angel is joined in the family. i give this movie 10 out of 10. wow, what\\'s this on the video rental store\\'s shelf in front of me? nothing other than a questionable \"sequel\" to 8mm. it wasn\\'t a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie. basically, from the plot outline verbatim, an american diplomat, david huxley, and his fiancã©e, tish harrington, venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in budapest, hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute, risa. the entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city. the mystery is solved when, in the end, tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and (essentially later on in the story) her fiancã©e which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end. i didn\\'t like how this had nothing to do with the original 8mm at all. the only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was, the fact that david ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film, and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene. otherwise, its a totally different movie. it made for a lousy love story, even before the end is known, which makes the ending more of a possibility because i didn\\'t believe the words coming out of david\\'s mouth the whole time. but we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble. there were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the \"shocking\" moments of the film, which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this \"hellish\" sex debauchery. i counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown. even the menu screen on the dvd is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the dvd seem totally provocative. david was no heroic person throughout the film. you could guess he was the main problem long before the end. the actors who played each role were all new to me, which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting \"respect.\" there were plot holes (how did david and richard finally impress tish\\'s father by getting the lease they wanted when david was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute?) there were cheesy technology moments (like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen), and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a joaquin phoenix knockoff to play this character. the tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete bs, too, because it wasn\\'t even about a last breath. nobody really dies. but they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere...but that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 3/4 long movie. go rent (and maybe buy) the original. it\\'s one of joel schumacher\\'s better and more original films. it has everything better about it from this film. i wouldn\\'t recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges. ok, honestly i dont see why everybody thinks this is so great. its really not. there were two good things that came out of this movie 1. jack\\'s performance, he was very good i can tip my hat for him. 2. danny\\'s performance, he was good. no other then that it got pretty stupid. and, what was stanley kubrick thinking drafting shelly as the wendy? she was so bad. she looked the same every time she got scared. the problem with this movie was the ending. i would have had more respect for it if kubrick would have ended it differently. and, the over all movie was just stupid. the problem with the movie is that the book was so much better. so dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off. 3/10. this episode had potential. the basic premise of a woman living next door to an empty apartment (but a phone that constantly rings) is somewhat interesting. and when she explores the noise, there is genuine tension and fear. but stupid script writing ruins any promise the episode had. first of all, the woman readily admits to seeing things that would send most of us running in the other direction (e.g. \"it\\'s funny that the door slammed shut even though there is no wind;\" \"this door has serious damage to it that wasn\\'t here a minute ago;\" \"the door opened by itself, without me touching it;\" etc.). given these supernatural phenomena, plus the fact that a woman committed suicide in the room, wouldn\\'t she take some precaution before entering it? maybe she could investigate in the day time. or maybe she could investigate the apartment with somebody else. or maybe she could turn on the lights!!! also, while in the haunted apartment, she decides to make numerous phone calls to the operator and gets into an argument over who has the power to disconnect the phone, and then they begin discussing the details of the suicide. just unplug the phone! the phone company doesn\\'t need to be involved. walk up to the phone and unplug it. case closed. finally, showing the phone scamper across the floor like it\\'s alive was just comical. if the director wanted the woman to get strangled by the phone card, he could\\'ve done it in a way that didn\\'t look cartoony. brave little toaster anyone? the quality of this movie is simply unmatched by any baseball title of its time. pam dixon branches out in the film industry to recruit blue-chip prospects and make this work of art a must-see. academy award winners brenda fricker (home alone: lost in new york, a time to kill), ben johnson (the last picture show, red dawn), and adrien brody (the pianist, the village) amplify the atmosphere of the movie, drawing in an anxious audience. however, the dramatic performances are neutralized by quirky radio broadcaster jay o. sanders (jfk, the day after tomorrow). the story is centralized around a foster child, up-and-coming actor joseph gordon-levitt (brick, the lookout). sidekick milton davis jr. delivers a tear-jerking performance as the longtime friend who never knew his parents. the two don\\'t have much, but what they do have: angels\\' baseball, and what they are seeking: identity. that\\'s when 4-time emmy nominee danny glover (lethal weapon, predator 2) comes in to save the day as frustrated angels manager, george knox. in relation, all characters in the story seem to have the same mission: search within themselves to find out who they really are. depressed over the fact that roger (jgl) is separated from his father, he wishes to god for reunification if the angels can take the pennant. odds are astronomical, but 3-time emmy winner christopher lloyd (back to the future, my favorite martian) comes in as the omniscient overseer to work a little magic (pun). before you know it, al (lloyd) is sitting with roger in the stands, snacking on cracker jacks, and causing some of baseball\\'s biggest boners! dorothy kingsley and george wells\\' (dk oscar nominee gw oscar winner) 1951 screenplay is done justice under the finger of mastermind william dear (nominated in directors guild of america). he includes a touching side story centered around pitcher mel clark, played by tony danza (4-time golden globe nominee, emmy nominee), who in relation to all other cast members is just trying to find his place in a confused anaheim. clark has been dubbed a wash-up, a once big-name in cinci, but he has something to prove to manager knox. spoiling this nail-biting plot would simply be the equivalent to committing adultery in the 18th century. this one is a diamond in the rough, and it will keep you on the edge of the seat until all come to peace. did i mention a cameo by matthew mcconaughey (a time to kill, we are marshall) for all you ladies out there? i kept watching it because it seemed like the plot was going somewhere. when it ambiguously got there i was very disappointed. i\\'m going to tell you what really happened in the next sentence. but maybe i won\\'t. maybe i\\'ll just imply something will happen. the writers lacked any imagination. this is not even a \"b\" movie - it\\'s a made for tv \"b\" movie. the movie itself made me want to go and call someone so they could enjoy it too. it was extremely funny. angelena jolie was wonderful as juliet. the parents are hilarious.they are caterers as well as enemies.the kids play the parts of romeo and juliet in the church play.they fall in love and their parents try to keep them apart.(spoiler ahead. i think) they sneak off after a party and do it. surprisingly they still want to get married in the end of the movie. if you don\\'t like stereotypes and the defilement of classic literature don\\'t watch. if you don\\'t mind those you will have a blast watching this one. if somebody wants to make a really, really bad movie, \"wizards of the lost kingdom\" really sets a yardstick by which to measure the depth of badness. start with the pseudo-chewbacca that follows around the main character ... some poor schmuck in a baggy white \"furry\" costume that looks as if it was stitched together from discarded pieces of carpeting. work your way slowly, painfully, through more not-so-special effects that thoroughly deny the viewer from suspension of disbelief. add a garden gnome (just for the heck of it). on second thought, skip this movie entirely and find something else to do for an hour and a half. a film for mature, educated audiences... i saw \"random hearts\" in an advance screening shortly before its north american release. this romantic drama was quite a treat. i\\'m sure this story will not be everyone\\'s cup of tea, especially considering the film\\'s darkly downbeat premise. but the pic has some very uplifting strong points in its favor. all-time box office draw harrison ford (\"star wars,\" \"raiders of the lost ark,\" \"the fugitive,\" \"air force one,\" \"patriot games\") is at the top of his game as the harried and desperate internal affairs officer, dutch. ford\\'s very subdued, nuanced performance shows quite the range he can achieve with class and determination in bringing the audience into his world of loss & betrayal. this is the perfect complex role and very different type of film for harrison ford to grace the screen with between his action blockbusters. next year harrison ford returns to action, first for director robert zemeckis (\"forrest gump,\" \"back to the future\") in his summer 2000 thriller, \"what lies beneath,\" and reportedly later in the year in the film adaptation of tom clancy\\'s \"the sum of all fears.\" \\'fears\\' will be harrison ford\\'s third outing as cia operative jack ryan. director sydney pollack (\"out of africa,\" \"the firm,\" \"tootsie\") has a supporting role in this feature as a political advisor to scott-thomas\\' congresswoman. it\\'s a very sharp & energetic portrayal for pollack. not only is sydney pollack a gifted director, he is also one of the most believable, natural and charming actors around (see \"eyes wide shut\" as well). kristin scott-thomas (\"the english patient,\" \"the horse whisperer\") shows that you don\\'t necessarily have to be eccentric or worldly to be considered sexy. this is one of her better films, and she gives a tremendously crafted and mellowed performance that works well opposite ford\\'s quiet-man toughness. the subplots work wonderfully, especially the subplot involving ford\\'s character\\'s investigation into police corruption. look for a chilling & effective turn by \"heat\" actor, dennis haysbert, who plays detective george beaufort, the obstacle to overcome in dutch\\'s investigation into police corruption. the rest of the supporting cast is a wonderful delight. charles s. dutton (whose long overdue for a film leading role) goes to show that he is one of the best character-actors around, and bonnie hunt, who i find extremely solid in this production, steals most of her scenes with that wonderful, charming smile as wendy judd. the technical side of pollack\\'s thriller is top notched. from dave grusin\\'s (pollack\\'s \"the firm\") perfectly surreal-feeling jazzy score, to philippe rousselot (\"a river runs through it\") crisp photography, to the sharp editing that keeps the film feeling fresh, despite the film\\'s unfortunate downer premise. i highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good yarn of mystery, well-paced plot, character-driven stories, and romance all rolled into one. this is a terrific story about betrayal & forgiveness. it also features one of the most surprising, yet poignant, and certain to be controversial endings for a harrison ford film in recent times. \"random hearts\" is definitely one of the better films of the year. (***1/2 out of ****) or (8.5 out of 10.0) for all of the has-beens or never was\\'s or for the curious, this film is for you....ever played a sport, or wondered what it felt like after the lights went down and the crowd left..this film explores that and more. robin williams(jack dundee) is a small town assistant banker in taft ca., whose life has been plagued, by a miscue in a big rival high school football game 13 years ago, when he dropped the pass that would have won over bakersfield, their arch-rival, that takes great pleasure in pounding the taft rockets, season after season . kurt russell(reno hightower) was the quarterback in that famous game, and is the local legend, that now is a van repair specialist, whose life is fading into lethargy, like the town of taft itself. williams gets an idea to remake history, by replaying the game ! he meets with skeptical resistance, so he goes on a one man terror spree, and literally paints the town , orange, yellow and black , to raise the ire of the residents to recreate the game . after succeeding, the players from that 1972 team reunite, and try to get in shape to practice, which is hysterical . the game is on , bakesfield is loaded with all of the high tech gadgets, game strategies, and sophisticated training routines . taft is drawing plays in the mud, with sticks, stones, and bottle caps, what a riot ! does taft overcome the odds, does robin willians purge the demons from his bowels, does kurt russell rise from lethargy, watch \"the best of times\" for one of the best viewing experiences ever! one of robin williams best understated performances, the chemistry between robin and russell is magic . and who is kid lester ??? holly palance and pamela reed give memorable performances as the wives of williams and russell. succeeds on many levels. a 10 ! this movie has to be one of the most boring and stupid movies that perrugorria have done. it looks like a commercial from beginning to end. the â¨directorâ¨spent the whole time on a tripod, it doesn\\'t have pace, rhythm. it\\'s illogical. what a mess. you can tell what\\'s gonna happen since the first 15 minutes, and the ending...wow ------spoiler------- jesus christ, how the hell perrugorria got shot? are you serious? worst scene of someone getting shot ever! ------end of spoiler----- bad directing, bad script, bad acting...really bad overall. i wouldn\\'t recommend this movie at all. it\\'s a waste of money and time. i first remember bumping into this zaniness from the zucker brothers and jim abrahams, back in the early days at comedy central. back in those days (the 90\\'s) their programming consisted of benny hill reruns and the original mst3k, complete with bearded host. capt. frank drebin (played by the stone-faced, dead-pan filibuster, leslie nielson) is a process created first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonists (think dragnet meets starsky & hutch the show), boiled in a flask full of well-known police television show plots and scenarios. this is distilled, 3 times to produce the most pure policeman every made. forget about simon pegg in hot fuzz (for now. save it for later). frank drebin is clueless at most times, a terrible driver, a terrible shot, macho yet sensitive and vulnerable. he is a master of the police investigative methodology (a.k.a - ask johnny the leathery old shoe-shine boy). this does not make him a bad cop. cops get lucky also. capt drebin (notice he\\'s a captain here) has perfected it. along with his partner, nordberg, and the rest of force, perfectly parody the police drama over the course of 6 golden episodes. the show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialog and quotable quote-ables. most of the sight gags are a bit dated and silly. the magic never came from the sight gags,however. at its core was a nonsensical and straight-faced conversation and activities in the foreground, with crazy things occurring in the background. the movies can best be described as 90 minute compilations of the best gags from this series. think of monty python\\'s and now for something completely different..... if you liked airplane 1 & 2, naked gun 1,2,3, or top secret, then you will definitely enjoy this. i always liked the series better than the movies, even though i saw the movies first. why? 2 words : no o.j. a guy desperate for action attempts to hit on a gorgeous girl in a bus. she refuses him, but when he runs after someone who tries to steal her purse they get together anyway. and there it starts - a relation that is slightly tainted by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero. it can\\'t be a secret that things between them are going to be problematic. in short, a story that could promise to grow out into a cool film. and imo, it succeeds at being a nice film. it\\'s no masterpiece, but it had me in tears from laughing on more than one occasion - the two lead characters twirl around each other in a crazy love fest that is, even with the superhero thing going, believable. so. thin story, but worked out really funny and thus worthy of cinema time. 7 out of 10 broken hearts i think it is great one of my favourite films as a kid and who said there songs were unforgettable they were mint i can still remember them now word for word the film remains a favourite with my family and my younger cousins are now addicted to it too they even know the songs this film is great and a enjoyable film for kids it has a moral lesson so don\\'t say its not good because it shows how lying gets you nowhere ill leave with a parting comment: this film is amazing love me xxx p.s i would like the soundtrack but i cant and yes the animation is good the jokes are humorous and the action never stops.this film will go down in children\\'s film history and in my opinion one of the only remaining safe films to show children. the film someone had to make. waco: the rules of engagement dissects the evidence behind the standoff in waco, texas that led to the destruction of the branch davidian homestead and the alleged government cover-up. the first thing you need to know about this film: you will see brief but disturbing photos of the victims bodies. this is not done for shock value, but to illustrate points about the way they died, as if you were present at the coroner\\'s inquest. the second thing you should know about this film: at two and a quarter hours, it\\'s pretty ponderous - especially if you already followed the events closely at the time. if you are unaware of any of the events other than what was reported in the mass media, or if the only side of the story you are familiar with is the official government report, this may be essential viewing. if, on the other hand you want a more concise (albeit unapologetically one sided) version of events, you should see \"waco: the big lie\". in summary, this is pretty much the definitive documentary about this tragic event, and is very sobering, but as a work of film-making, could test your patience, especially if you have a short attention span. and it\\'s at times superfluous for those who watched the cspan hearings and the 60 minutes reports. perhaps someday someone will make a documentary that covers some of the stranger aspects of this story, such as the bizarre chain of events that led up to the atf raid or the psychological warfare tactics the fbi used blasting rock music at the sect, and their charismatic leaders (all rock musicians themselves) picking up their instruments and turning their massive amplifiers outward to blast their own music right back at them. what a good movie! at last a picture revealing a unknown side of rock: illusions of fame. well-known rockers are getting old and forgotten, not the music. and with a good sense of humour. have you ever danced on bill haley\\'s rock around the clock? anyway, still crazy is probably the best movie about rock n\\'roll i have ever seen. far much better than spinal tap for instance. why? because in still crazy, people are mature. they have a different point of view about rock, about love and about life. they want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much. beyond the story itself, we see characters with their own personality, weaknesses and dreams. like anyone of us. spend a good time watching this (listen to the awesome soundtrack! )and finally thinking of your own future. bye! had it with the one who raised you since when you were young? you just want her gone from your life? that woman is your mother. you should respect her, you should honor her, whether she\\'s in sick or well. but that in times, it can be aggravating. especially when she becomes very overbearing. that\\'s how owen(danny devito) had to deal with in \"throw momma fron the train\". his momma(anne ramsey, 1929-88), is one of the worst. he trying his best to be a writer, and she is everything but grateful. calls him a \"clumsy poop\", a \"larda$$\", and \"fat\" and \"stupid\". for his friend, larry donner(billy crystal) he has his own woman problems, his ex-wife. she trying to discredit him. so what did owen do? push her overboard. what does he do? help return the favor, get rid of mrs. lift! in the kitchen scene, i liked it where owen called larry, \"cousin patty\". and momma said, \"you don\\'t have a cousin patty!\" and owen shouts \"you lied to me!\" and el cabongs larry with the frying pan. then comes the fun part when they where on the train and try to kill momma lift. that is thwarted, and she kicks larry off the train. well, everything back to normal, the ex-wife lives, but momma kicked the bucket on her own. maybe she should have seen the errors of her domineering ways. a fun movie it is, and the cast is great. a classic! 5 stars! yes, it is a bit cheesy. but it\\'s suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters. it\\'s interesting to see david soul in a \\'bad guy\\' role; i thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid co. robert conrad is a long-time favorite--i think he brings his character to life very well; and sam waterston has been star quality in everything of his i\\'ve watched--movies or tv. i watch this movie every so often but our tape (a vhs tv copy i got) is such poor quality it\\'s difficult to fully enjoy it. this is a movie i think they should put out on dvd; maybe it wouldn\\'t be universally sought after, but i\\'m sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there would be a market for a dvd version. i\\'ll keep hoping! so it isn\\'t an epic, but for people experiencing anything similar (sibling suicide) it might be an interesting way of therapy. an imaginative narrative and some fine acting makes it time well spent. for some reason, it hasn\\'t really caught on in the audience, something i do believe is a result of the main theme. why did she commit suicide? clearly, this is hardly something that us moviegoers will flock to, had it been an european production it probably would have reached its audience in a much greater extent. it is however, a movie that although the realism tainted by a shimmering romanticized glow, gives the viewer a whole hearted impression. i absolutely loved this film! i was hesitant to watch it at first because i thought it would be too painful. i remember how hard it was when john was shot. however, watching the \"two of us\" took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility. i think that the writer did an amazing job depicting what \"might have been.\" aidan quinn was adorable as paul and met the challenge head on. i was impressed with his accent and mannerisms. jared harris is also very talented and was quite believable as john. my favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which was so poignant. the film left me with both sadness and satisfaction, both of which i feel are appropriate, given the circumstances. previous reviewer claudio carvalho gave a much better recap of the film\\'s plot details than i could. what i recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful, in every sense - emotionally, visually, editorially - just gorgeous. if you like movies that are wonderful to look at, and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant, i think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art. on a scale of 1 to 10, i\\'d give it about an 8.75. the only reason i shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece. if you are in the mood for a really artistic, very romantic film, then it\\'s a 10. i definitely think it\\'s a must-see, but none of us can be in that mood all the time, so, overall, 8.75. great premise, poor execution. cast of great actors is watered down into a poorly written, poorly directed, poorly edited, waste of film. only redeeming quality is the numerous shots of the food. joan chen, mercedes ruehl, kyra sedgwick, and alfre woodard should fire their agents. have to agree that this movie and it\\'s talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve. here\\'s hoping that the dvd will do very well and bring both to the attention of a wider audience. the actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent. perhaps overall the movie is a little long but may miles thomas seems to enjoy her actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes holds them in longer close ups than necessary. good for the actors i am sure but sometimes as the audience you are ready to move on so to speak with the plot. may miles thomas deserves more recognition from the film business as one of our foremost digital movie directors, i had two reasons for watching this swashbuckler when it aired on danish television yesterday. first of all, i wanted to see gina lollobrigida - and here i wasn\\'t disappointed. she looked gorgeous. second of all, through reading about the film i had gotten the impression that it featured absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in philippe de broca\\'s films. on this account, however, i was sadly disappointed. i found the jokes predictable (apart from a few witty remarks on the topic of war) and the characters completely one-dimensional. also, the action scenes were done in a strangely mechanical and uninspired fashion, with no sense of drama at all. i kept watching until the end, but i got bored very quickly and just sat there, waiting for the scenes with lollobrigida. this film is an abomination of all that is worthy in film making. the lead actor surprises his audience by not actually acting at all. we have to watch almost two hours of his bland soulless face. the jokes are all lame i never laughed once it was saturday night there were 5 of us having a beer all up for a laugh and then we put this on and you could feel all the warmth and colour being drained from the room. the film ended and the mood was ruined so we all went our separate ways, ruined the night ! ok so pros and cons. pros beautiful setting in hawaii, looks good on bluray. cons worst acting ever; you can tell everyone concerned is just thinking about payday. predictable poor plot. zero character development. forced jokes which fall flat. many shots of the guys penis which to be fair acts better than him and has more charisma. may all makers of this film hang their heads in shame and hold their flaccid manhoods cheap. this was my first gaspar noe movie i\\'ve watched and i have to say i was shocked. i don\\'t mind gore in generally, but this isn\\'t even gore , it\\'s real butchering. for some of you a couple of scenes may be impossible to see and i mean really disgusting. leaving aside these aspects, the main ideas revealed here and the dialog are quite brilliant. when you are given a strong argument against bringing a new life into the world and the manner in which it is given, you can\\'t stop and take a minute to think about it. the actors did their job well, representing general masks of a handpick few people found at the bottom of a diseased society. the movie is full of metaphors, but i\\'ll let you figure them out. don\\'t watch it if you want to have a lite, relaxing time. i recommend this movie to all those of you who want something to think about or simply watch something different of what you find in your average cinema. i agree with bigalc - this movie actually prepared me for a lot of the cultural differences and practices before i went to live in japan for a year in 1993. tom selleck does a fantastic job here, as always, and the movie is greatly humorous and educational. i\\'m a big fan of tom selleck\\'s, and he blesses this part with his usual charm and charisma to this part, bringing the film to life in a way i can\\'t imagine any other actor being able to pull off. this film featured some first-rate japanese actors, and it was highly entertaining to watch them as they interacted with selleck - i can imagine the fun he had during the actual filming of the movie - japan\\'s an awesome place to go, whether you want to party, sight-see or just try to take everything in. i laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt. ben affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy jack black in this role. gandolfini gives his typical a performance. the entire cast is funny, the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome. i went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why i was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted. i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy, can identify with loneliness during the holidays and/or putting up with the relatives. the best part to this film (to me anyway) were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped. namely, the scene involving the lighting of the christmas tree. go see it and have a good laugh! although i lived in australia in 1975, i moved overseas not long after, fed up with constant industrial unrest, the general worship of mediocrity - unless one is a sportsman! - and the complacency of so many australians who chose to ignore the breakneck pace of change taking place in countries to their north. consequently i missed the dismissal, along with many other australian-made tv dramas of the \\'80s and \\'90s, such as the superb janus and phoenix series, which i have since seen, along with wildside. to me the filmed story of the dismissal is fair and, as far as i am aware, accurate. however, as to public \"outrage\" it only shows one side of the picture, not how families were riven by the controversy. i know, as my two brothers would not speak to me for months afterward. but the commentary is, in my view, very one-sided throughout. the inescapable fact is that, notwithstanding fiery expressions of rage from a substantial proportion of the community, the australian electorate chose - and chose decisively - in favour of fraser, as they did again two years later. this apart, a historically accurate and superbly well acted docudrama. i may be a good old boy from virginia in the confederate states of america, but this man does it for me. that mustache gets me riled up. i remember when i first saw a video of his. that girl he beat was amazing. the depth of his acting when they cut to his weathered facade was a new level of masculinity. it reminds me of the granite sculptures of our mt. rushmore. if i could ask him one question, it would be,\"if you were a hot-dog, would you eat yourself?\" will orhan be doing a reunion tour? take note from the greats like gordon lightfoot, true music from the heart never fades away. vive la john denver. gracias my friend, o.f.f.l. (orhan fan for life) i never want to see this movie again! not only is it dreadfully bad, but i can\\'t stand seeing my hero stan laurel looking so old and sick. mostly i can\\'t stand watching this terrible movie! frankly, there is no reason to watch this awful film. the plot is just plain stupid. the actors that surround stan laurel and oliver hardy are really really bad and laurel and hardy have been funnier in any of their earlier films! i warn you don\\'t watch it, the images will haunt you for a long while to come! the problem is the role of the characters in the film. man to man shows a british anthropologist kidnapping two pygmies and taking them to scotland and then realising that they are not animals or subhumans but actually equal to himself. the problem is the role of the pygmies in the film - two people who are kidnapped, treated like animals, and yet given such a shallow, stereotypical role within the film... the kidnapper (british anthropologist) ends up being the hero of the film because he \\'manages\\' to relate to the pygmies... no notion of how the two hostages feel, of their point of view, of their ordeal... i find it is a shallow film, with a one sided fundamentally racist view... it never manages to move away from the \\'white mans\\' view life begins - and ends - in a typical 1930\\'s maternity / recovery ward, where we view 48 hours in the lives of several high risk pregnant women, played by loretta young, glenda farrell, clara blandick (aunty em???), vivienne osborne, dorothy tree, and gloria shea, as they await to give birth. while the film features plot devices which seem far fetched today when maternity wards are much more controlled and restricted, it does offer us a look back in time to see what giving birth in a typical city hospital in 1932 was like for our grandmothers and great-grandmothers. i found the film fascinating and exceptionally moving. oddly enough, the most outstanding performance in this film comes from a male cast member, young eric linden as jed sutton, grace\\'s (loretta young) husband. what an actor! as a first time father, jed is distraught and uneasy with hospital staff who seem to brush off his concerns about his wife as they might brush crumbs off a cafeteria table. i felt his every concern keenly. i\\'d like to see more of this actor\\'s work. he had a very emotional voice, which was used to unforgettable effect in gone with the wind. in that film eric played the young soldier whose leg was amputated without anesthesia, who screamed \"don\\'t cut! don\\'t cut!\" as scarlett fled the hospital in horror. chilling! another great performance is from aline macmahon, who plays miss bowers, the nurse. her character is a salt of the earth type, the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stays, who breaks the hospital rules constantly in order to show a more humane side of the medical profession. loretta young did another superb acting job here as well, a very authentic and deeply felt performance as grace. my, she is great in these precodes, i\\'ve really grown to appreciate her more as an actress the last few months. glenda farrell played her role of a shrill unwed mother a little over the top for my taste (didn\\'t anyone know back in 1932 that swigging brandy from a hot water bottle might be hazardous to unborn babies\\' health?) but her character redeems herself in the end. also in the cast was an uncredited gilbert roland, silent movie star, as a grieving italian husband. his screen time was brief, but notable. life begins is a must-see precode, try to catch it sometime on tcm, but remember to bring a few hankies to cry into. 9 out of 10. this is a great film. touching and strong. the direction is without question breathless. good work to the team. i feel so sorry for marlene, by the grace of god go you or i i think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet-paper. no respect whatsoever to many important details which intrinsically make the movie. for example, the names of some serbian terrorists (that i remember) are caradan maldic, ivanic loyvek and leo hasse. what kind of names are that? certainly not serbian! by the way, caradan maldic!!! what a name, i laughed for days thinking about it. probably an implication on karadzic and mladic. secondly, there have never been any cases of terrorism done by serbians. a journalist like the main character ought to have known that. thirdly, the actors playing serbian terrorists are not even serbs nor do they speak serbo-croatian. all this aside, this movie is solidly acted but the story is paper-thin and full of holes. at times it makes no sense whatsoever!!! *criticism does mention spoilers* i rarely make user comments, but this is one movie i have no problem slandering. this movie stinks, and its mediocre of rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for such pulp. the bone collector is not at all the same calibre of film that silence of the lambs or seven were, despite what its ad claims. this is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller. the pace of this movie was extremely slow- i actually left for about 10 minutes half-way through and came back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression (i refer to you the part where angelina jolie\\'s character debates denzel about cutting off a corpse\\' hands). the movie is not at all scary, but tries to compensate this with a love-subplot albeit sexy angelina jolie\\'s character and denzel washington\\'s. of course, what you get is something comparable to that of the mentor-student relationship as seen in the brillian epic silence of the lambs with hannibal lecter and starling, however, even this lacks all effectiveness and i was personally routing for the villain to kill denzel off so as to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two. with such a crappy movie, i was half-expecting a plot-twist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit- things that mediocre movies like arlington road and scream pulled off. anybody with a 4th grade education can see the ending how will be resolved ( a situation which mimicks alfred hitchcock\\'s rear window). the cliche of having the killer explain his motives was uninspired enough, but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid it had me spewing latte over the screen. esoterically speaking, i even think the murderer\\'s intention was completely lost as denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial \\'chess game\\' and gets with his pet project, angelina. if you are a fan of movies with original ideas and genuinely dynamic concepts (like i am), you will not appreciate this film. if you have not attended a single movie in your life and would like to catch-up on every single hollywood cliche ever borne (the late-night knock on the window from somebody else but the murderer, the ridiculous serial-killer to prime investigator relationship, the horrible \\'woman trying to get by in an all-male dominated workforce aka sotl) , see this movie....but even then its too slow-paced and you\\'d be bored. possible spoilers, perhaps. i must say that \"cinderella ii: dreams come true\" is one of the worst movies ever made. first of all, the movie was made during the height of disney\\'s sequel rampage. it was created around the same time as \"the little mermaid ii,\" \"the jungle book ii,\" and \"peter pan ii,\" all of which were disservices to their original film classics. (disney also made \"the hunchback of notre dame ii\" and \"atlantis ii,\" but i\\'m going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place.\") let me go ahead and say that i am an avid supporter of good disney films, and i absolutely adore the original disney \"cinderella.\" the sequel to \"cinderella,\" however, was a waste of time. the character of cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that i grew up watching. in the original, cinderella was kind and loving. the new cinderella had very out-of-character moments with current-era phrasing like, \"i\\'m going to do this banquet my way!\" let me also tell you that new cinderella (as i have affectionately named her) says, \"ewww!\" that is the anti-cinderella. i try to find the best in people, but in the sequel, anastasia, one of the stepsisters, is good! what the heck? why? they made it all out to be like lady tremaine and drizella are just horrible family members for poor little anastasia. my question to the world: did the people at disney watch the original \"cinderella\" when making this sequel? well, it surely doesn\\'t seem so. if i remember correctly, anastasia was just as abusive to cinderella as drizella and lady tremaine. i am all for redemption and forgiveness, but there was no point of redemption for anastasia in this movie. in the first one, anastasia was evil. in the second one, she is good. one just can\\'t leave a story like this. i hope disney realizes that this movie, among other movies, is shaming walt disney\\'s name. perhaps now that michael eisner is gone, things will start shaping up around the house of mouse. hopefully the score has changed by now due to my brilliant and stunning review which persuades all of you to go and watch the film thereby creating an instant chorus of \"8\"s, this movie\\'s true score. as mentioned before chris rock is the king! previous to going to see this movie i wasn\\'t that over the top about him but now i\\'m banging on the doors of chris rock\\'s website begging him to take me on as his protege. this film is truly funny, if you don\\'t find this movie funny you really need therapy and it\\'s humour which targets all areas of society including race(predictably), class division, love, wealth, employment, dreams, stand up comedy... the list goes on. there was one slight disappointment for me however. this was that in going into this film i didn\\'t realise that it was actually a remake of \"heaven can wait\" another quite good movie made in 1971 with warren beatty. as such i was quite surprised when i watched this movie and suddenly the plot began to unravel to be distinctly similar to an older movie i had watched on tv a few weeks ago.. regardless this movie is in my opinion the better version out of the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that chris rock is funnier than warren beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of any...you get the picture. well to the actual plot of the film. don\\'t spoil the experience for yourself! don\\'t read the plot! just go and watch a movie because there have been two reviews on imdb so far that have raved mad about it, go see it because it is the funniest thing you would have seen in a long time, go and see it because it\\'s a cinema experience that doesn\\'t leave you grumbling ad nauseum at the cost of cinema tickets. go see it because it is a good movie! formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (vargas). it looks very much like a tv movie, not really exciting. the only reason i bothered to see it was because valentina vargas was in it. no real surprises here, though it is nice to see vargas. great looking chilenian landscapes on display but malcolm mcdowell\\'s part is very small and doesn\\'t add much to the movie. michael ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts. the chase scenes are standard fare. whatever rating i give boom is only because of the superb location photography of sardinia and rome. otherwise, this is only for hardcore addicts of elizabeth taylor (her downward phase), and richard burton (his miscasting phase). tennessee williams wrote \"the milk train doesn\\'t stop here anymore\" and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play--but apparently, he was the only one. taylor reportedly hated it and burton needed the money. whatever, it amounts to a hill of beans with taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner, exploding at the servants and exchanging bad baby-talk with no less than noel coward who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears. it\\'s so campy that among taylor fans it\\'s probably considered a \"must see\" kind of thing. but if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand, you\\'re way ahead of me. sadly, this is the film that signified the end of taylor being taken seriously as a film actress, even after winning two oscars. for burton, it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a bomb. judge for yourself if you dare. viva la bam this \"jackass\" spin off focuses on the (obviously scripted) adventures of bam margera and his pals (johnny knoxville, brandon dicamillo, etc). this show, while it has its fair share of gross-out comedy and crazy stunts, focuses mainly on bam\\'s torturing of his parents. i\\'m sorry to say this, bam, but... you\\'re in no way as cool as you think you are. this ego tripped show is not only painfully unfunny (and yes, i liked jackass), but also narcissistic beyond belief. the overly stylized intro ends with bam coolly explaining that he\\'s going to do \"whatever the f***\" he wants to. how about you do something that is actually funny? i liked \"jackass\" for what it was worth. the camera-work was horrible - any idiot could have made a better show with a camcorder in their parents\\' garage - but at least the show moved at a steady pace and never felt boring between the crazy, dangerous or simply disgusting stunts the pals performed. not so with \"viva la bam\". we follow our hero around as he plays pranks on his friends and tortures his relatives, but never does it feel like anything else than really lame and scripted comedy. the stunts and pranks are mildly entertaining, but presented in such a tedious and dull fashion that they can barely make you smile. \"viva la bam\" is a poor spin-off of that does little good but feed margera\\'s already too big ego. i don\\'t recommend this lame and unimaginative show to anyone. i had never heard of larry fessenden before but judging by this effort into writing and directing, he should keep his day job as a journeyman actor. like many others on here, i don\\'t know how to categorize this film, it wasn\\'t scary or spooky so can\\'t be called a horror, the plot was so wafer thin it can\\'t be a drama, there was no suspense so it can\\'t be a thriller, its just a bad film that you should only see if you were a fan of the blair witch project. people who liked this film used words, like \"ambiguity\" and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that wasn\\'t there. like the blair witch, people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff that it was terrifying. this movie actually started off well with the family \"meeting\" the locals after hitting a deer. it looked like being a modern day deliverance but then for the next 45 minutes, (well over half the film), nothing happened, the family potted about their holiday home which was all very nice and dandy but not the slightest bit entertaining. it was obvious the locals would be involved in some way at some stage but essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in a movie. finally, when something does happen, its not even clear how the father was shot, how he dies, (the nurse said his liver was only grazed), and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with 3rd grade special effects. the film is called wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way, the film ends all muddled and leaves you very unsatisfied, i would have bailed out with 15 minutes to go but i wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself. it didn\\'t. schlocky \\'70s horror films...ya gotta love \\'em. in contrast to today\\'s boring slasher flicks, these k-tel specials actually do something scary and do not resort to a tired formula. this is a b movie about the making of a b movie...that went horribly wrong. faith domergue (this island earth) stars as an over-the-hill, b movie queen making a movie about a series of grisly murders that befell a family in their home. her boyfriend/director, who looks and acts like gordon jump with an attitude, is filming on location and on a tight schedule. the ken doll co-star discovers a book of tibetian chants that they work into the script to add \"realism\". unfortunately, \"realism\" is something they could have done without. john carradine, having long since given up looking for the 17th gland (the unearthly), now eeks out a humble existence as the caretaker for the estate. he goes about his daily work, but always seems to run afoul of the director. the horror builds slowly; a dead cat here, john carradine entering a grave there, finally culminating in seven, yes seven murders. (at least there\\'s truth in advertising.) it\\'s just sad that the ghoul didn\\'t understand that there was a movie being made above him. how was poor faith to know that those darn tibetian chants would actually work? face it, you just can\\'t go around tugging on satan\\'s coat and expect him to take it lying down. sterno says perform an autopsy on the house of seven corpses. i suppose for 1961 this film was supposed to be \" cool \" , but looking back now ( 45 years ) it\\'s charm was just as silly as it\\'s entertainment value ! granted , the special effects do well on t.v. with the series that started in 1964 , but for the big screen ?? i once had a fish tank that was equally as exciting ! i must agree about the octopus scene near the end where it attached itself to the seaview. obviously not well staged...or trained ! overall , it\\'s pretty bad acting with shoddy special effects and i still do recommend it - for fun laughs sake. this was probably one of irwin allen\\'s biggest films and i think he thought a lot of it . barabara eden went on to play \" genie \" on t.v. micheal ansara was her husband . now that is a cool part about this film ! i always enjoyed seeing real life husband and wife teams star in the same movie . neat ! this is one of the finest films to come out of hong kong\\'s \\'new wave\\' that began with tsui hark\\'s \"zu: warriors of magic mountain\". tsui set a tone for the new wave\\'s approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the new wave (jackie chan, sammo hung, wong jing, ching siu tung, etc.) accepted from then on as a given; namely, the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony, if not outright comedy. \"burning paradise\" put a stop to all that, and with a vengeance. it\\'s not that there isn\\'t humor here; but it is a purely human humor, as with the aged buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw. but this is just as humans are, not even buddhist priests can be saints all the time. when irony is at last introduced into the film, it is the nastiest possible, emanating from the \\'abbot\\' of red lotus temple, who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before. he is the very incarnation of milton\\'s satan from \"paradise lost\": \"better to rule in hell than serve in heaven!\" and if he can\\'t get to satan\\'s hell soon enough, he\\'ll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule. that\\'s the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here: it\\'s not that the abbot just wants to kill people; he wants them to despair, to feel utterly hopeless, to accept his nihilism as all-encompassing reality. thus there\\'s a definite sense pervading the red temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the temple itself - it has become all there is to the universe, and the abbot, claiming mastery of infinite power, is in charge. of course, fortunately, the film doesn\\'t end there. though there are losses, the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails. (if you want to know how, see the film!) yet there is no doubt that, in viewing this film, we visit hell. hopefully, we do not witness our own afterlives; but we certainly feel chastened by the experience - and somehow better for it over all. now i don\\'t hate cheap movies. i just don\\'t see why you should waste any money for a movie you could shoot with your dad\\'s camcorder. if i rent a movie, i want it to be a movie, not a bunch of people thinking it would be a good idea to waste some minidv - tapes. maybe i hate this one so much because the guy in the video store said it was great, and it wasn\\'t. maybe i hate it because it\\'s cheap, has the dumbest plot ever, the most unrealistic characters ever and the really, really, really worst showdown in the history of films ever. even tom savini can\\'t save this. seriously, this one is a complete waste of time. a fabulous book about a fox and his family who does what foxs do. that being stealing from farms and killing prey. until a trio of farmers decide they\\'ve had enough of this fox and try in various ways to have the problem \"solved\". they are of course \"out foxed\" at every turn and while the trio are camped out at the fox hole the family perform raids against the three farmers land. the\"film\" version ,and i use the term film very loosely, is more of a god awful pastiche of american heist movies particularly the oceans movies. they they even have george clooney as mr fox to to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely. so kudos to them .they\\'ll make lots of money and destroy another classic roald dahl children book. as soon as it hits a screen, it destroys all intelligent life forms around ! but on behalf of its producers i must say it doesn\\'t fall into any known movie category, it deserves a brand new denomination of its own ! it\\'s a \"neurological drama\" ! it saddens and depresses every single neuron inside a person\\'s brain. it\\'s the closest thing one will ever get to a stroke without actually suffering one. it drives you speechless, all you members go numb, your mouth falls open and remains so, and the most strange symptom of all is that you get yourself wishing to go blind and deaf. no small feat for such a sort of a \"movie\". the only word that comes to my mind just having finished my ordeal is outrage !!!!!! for a film made in senegal, based, i guess loosely on carmen, the book, by prosper merimee, this film doesn\\'t achieve a mere resemblance of the story that has been made famous as an opera and as other films. ms. gai as the karmen of the title is very good to look at. her fiery dancing smolders the screen, as is the case with her torrid love scene at the beginning of the film. this is a karmen that aims to please to all genders, but a real carmen, she is not! we would like to see ms. gai in other films in which her talent is better used than here. this is a very noir kind of episode. it begins with jim returning from a weekend trip with a new girlfriend, the recently divorced karen mills (pat delaney--daughter in law of john huston, who knew a few things about noir film) and her daughter. when they arrive, karen goes in the house while jim picks up her daughter from the back seat and carries her up to her room. he then discovers karen has disappeared without a trace. of course he calls dennis and when the police arrive, they see no sign of karen, but find her next door neighbor murdered in the bushes. so of course that makes jim an immediate suspect. this is a great little mystery and the first half of the story is shown by rocky asking jim to go over the story once again. rocky suggests that by jim telling him the story he might remember a little detail that he didn\\'t think was important at the time, but now might lead to a clue as to what happened. it\\'s a really well written scene and completes the transition of the rocky character from a grifter to a concerned parent. it also goes a long way to show that rocky isn\\'t just some clueless old man either. as he says \"you come to me because i\\'m your father. and i\\'m smarter than you!\" this is one of those times where we see where jim got his smarts. this episode also features an appearance by hottie lara parker, who played angelique in the \"dark shadows\" series and went on to play laura banner, bruce\\'s wife in the \"incredible hulk\" series a few years later. she looks terrific here. this episode also marks the first mention of the minette crime family, a name that would keep popping up on the rockford files almost whenever they needed a mob family. this time, its vincent minette who rockford helps apprehend. lt. diehl (tom atkins) makes his first appearance on the series and dennis is quietly demoted from a police lieutenant that he was on the earlier season one episodes to a police sargent. i guess they figured it would be better to have dennis less powerful and add some conflict between jim and the police. frankly, they were right, though i prefer the later lt. chapman to lt. diehl. not a lot of the typical \"rockford\" humor in this episode, but a good mystery with a lot of heart. the royal rumble has traditionally been one of my favourite events, and i\\'ve been a wrestling fan for a good few years now. the other shows may have better matches, but i\\'ve always found the actual rumble match to be full of excitement. i\\'m not going to reveal the winners of any match as i don\\'t see it as fair to ruin the results on a review. i will comment on the quality of them though. we have the standard 4 matches, and then the big rumble event. two from smackdown and two from raw. shawn michaels and edge open up for raw. this proves to be a good match from two talented guys. this is a match i\\'d recommend watching. it\\'s hard to sum up without giving away the winner. next we have the usual undertaker against some big nasty monster, be whoever it is. giant gonzales, yokozuna, kamala... well this time it\\'s heidenreich. its also a casket match. typical undertaker fare. watch if you\\'re a fan. i have to admit i am, purely for the entertainment factor. it can hardly be regarded as a classic wrestling match. the next two matches are the title matches. for once smackdown manages to upstage raw. their title match is pretty thrilling and enjoyable, but with a anti-climax and let down to end it. raw\\'s match is a pretty dull and boring affair, which is a pity as i\\'m a fan of both guys involved. now to the main reason i love the event, the rumble. it\\'s a pretty good one this year. coming up to the event we all had a pretty good idea of who might win, and it may not prove a big surprise, but hey, its very enjoyable. there are the usual diverse ways of people being eliminated. there is the token guy who doesn\\'t make it to the ring, the entrant who is ridiculous and we all want to see vanquished, and someone gets eliminated by a previously eliminated combatant. it has its usual highs and lows, and i loved the ending, in particular the vince mcmahon entrance. i\\'d recommend this show. not the wwe on top form, but its still good. add it to your collection. i remember this in a similar vein to the young ones. we\\'d stumble back from the pub and watch this or tape it and then spend weeks replaying the lines to each other. we called one of our mates \"zipmole watkins\" after the brilliant episode in which daniel peacock has a bit of \\'restyling\\' on his nose by the back street abortionist. lots of great lines \"remember at 5:30 in the morning you can only get white bread from a brown man. take it easy guy!\" - gandhi as a local shopkeeper. tony woodcock was definitely on there in the episode they were teaching ralph (daniel peacock) to be a barman \"it\\'s no good amanda i\\'ll never make it as a bar man\" helen lederer teaches him to ask people about the match \"see the match last night? i thought woodcock played well\" after a string of failed conversations the curly haired arsenal star was sitting at the bar: \"see the match last night?\" \"yeah. i thought i played well\" we still do odd stupid lines now - \"reg and ralph..... or....... ralph and reg. reg, reg... reg reg reg reg\" lots of very surreal silly moments and very surreal songs from the flatlets - the back street abortionist a personal favourite with the great ending line - \"and he\\'ll mark your packages \\'return to sender\" good old danny peacock - you added a lot to some young drinkers\\' evenings sir. **update - i found a couple of episodes on tape - i\\'m going to upload the gandhi sketch to youtube ** destined to be a classic before it was even conceptualized. this game deserves all the recognition it deserves. at a time when first-person shooters like quake iii arena and unreal tournament are garnering all the attention of computer gamers, graphic adventures are a dying breed. with great pun and humour, the curse of monkey island is a game that people of all age groups would enjoy. life can only improve after playing the curse of monkey island. *prediction* the sequel escape from monkey island is already destined to be a classic too. i guarantee it. stephane audran is the eponymous heroine of this beautifully measured study of a small danish community towards the end of the last century. two beautiful and musically talented sisters give-up their own prospects of happiness and marriage in order to look-after their ageing father. one day, a french woman, babette, comes to work for them. after some years she wins the lottery and is determined to do something for the sisters who have taken her in. her solution is to prepare an exquisite and sumptuous feast, which changes the lives of all those invited. this is a film about human and cultural interaction, reflected in the changing language of the dialogue from danish to french, and especially between the dutiful sobriety of protestant northern europe and the sensuousness of the catholic south. it is also about human needs, and how warmth and kindness can be expressed and stimulated through the cultivation of the senses. a profoundly uplifting film. this movie was way over-hyped. a lot of the viewers, who thought this was \"amazing\" must have been into the old school movies, cause the whole movie is set in the past. at first i thought the movie was just showing something from the past, so i was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass, but it just going. basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past, and the 2 don\\'t mix very well in this movie, even with special effects. you could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with. there are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did, so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying \"it\\'s the greatest movie ever done\". it\\'s just crap on a stick. it also didn\\'t help that the story line was sooo crappy. i don\\'t understand why hollywood agreed to have this movie produced, and i also don\\'t understand how actors/actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this. it\\'s almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print...\"it will all be done on a computer\". this was a movie that should have been on a movie network, because nothing about this movie was revolutionary. i\\'m very upset with myself for paying money to see this. whatever you do, don\\'t waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow. it is incredible that there were two films with the same story released in 2005. this one came out a day before that other one with tom cruise. didn\\'t they do that with truman capote the same year, and the zodiac killer last year? interesting. writer/director david michael latt didn\\'t have steven spielberg\\'s budget and c. thomas howell is not tom cruise. this is a pale imitation of the blockbuster that grossed $588 million worldwide. the action was minimal and most of the time we were treated to the whining of rhett giles, who played a pastor that was giving up on his god. gary busey was creepy as an army lt. i dunno sometimes...you try and try and try to be charitable towards all the b thru z grade movies out there, but once in a while a particular movie just tests your patience until you want to slap everyone involved. \"bat people\" (which i saw under the title \"it lives by night\") is just such a movie. you can\\'t watch this without thinking that it really should have been an episode on \"night gallery\", and not one of the better ones, either. the movie has something to do with a doctor who gets bitten by a bat and consequently starts to morph into a were-bat who drinks human blood. (actually, you\\'d think if he was turning into a real bat, he\\'d be eating mosquitoes by the gallon bucket, but because this is a cheap, lurid horror movie, blood\\'s the word.) in spite of the fact that he has grand-mal seizures at the drop of a hat, and black-out episodes almost every night, his friend and fellow physician, dr. mustache aspen-extreme, insists that he\\'s just having an \\'allergic reaction\\' to the rabies shots. meanwhile, the world\\'s most obnoxious and stereotyped county sheriff suspects the doc of being responsible for the brutal murder and exsanguination of several local girls (and one wino). also meanwhile, the doctor\\'s wife decides that denial is a river in egypt and alternately patronizes him and nags him to distraction. it\\'s not so much that the acting is bad - you can tell that the actors are making professional level choices, and are trying to bring some juice and life to the script, even the guy who plays the sheriff. (okay, it is pretty bad, but it\\'s bad in a clichã©d, wooden, professional way). it\\'s just that everything about the acting, the way the scenes are paced, the costumes, the dialog, the script and the story line in general sets your teeth on edge and makes you want to, well, slap everyone involved. i think the movie had an outside chance at being a spooky, unsettling little cult favorite, but: 1)the director needed to beat michael pataki, an experienced character actor, with a chair until pataki agreed to act, and not just channel dennis weaver. 2)he also needed to find a script that made a little more sense with regard to the whole \"bat bites human, who then turns into a bat\" scenario. 3) he also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a little more physically believable bit of stage business for his \\'episodes\\', instead of resorting to \"man has a seizure\" page from the little golden book of clichã©d acting mannerisms. 4) he needed to rework the whole \\'wife\\' character, make her both more intelligent, less shrill and waaaaay more observant. i would never voluntarily watch this film again, except with the help of mike and the bots. it\\'s bad, but it isn\\'t bad in a silly, humorous or interesting way. still better than \"battlefield earth\" or \"waterworld\", though. big fat liar is what you get when you combine terrific writing, great production, and an emphasis on clever ideas over adolescent pap. the two stars work great together, and--what can i say? amanda bynes shines. putting \"irkel\" and lee majors in the film were brilliant touches. watch this film with your kids. if you don\\'t laugh throughout it, you must not have been paying attention. tim robbins and john cusack are two actors i have appreciated throughout their careers, and that was the only reason for choosing to watch this movie. well, all i can say is i totally regretted it! these two great actors humiliate themselves all the way through by performing a number of irrelevant, unimaginative and kitch to the extreme (not that this is bad on its own)sketches that are supposed to make people laugh, but fail to do so. the only reason i can think is that the director was their friend, and they decided to support his movie by starring in it-i can\\'t think of anything else because this movie is so cheap! fortunately tim robbins and john cusack haven\\'t disappointed me ever since. i would recommend you to avoid this film, unless you want your opinion about the two actors spoiled. on watching this film, i was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. karen carpenter was a carefree, but very unconfident young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs. as with all celebrities of today, they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks, styles, etc. this had a huge effect on karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight, which eventually caused her death. this heart felt film was not initially something which i would have thought of watching. but on starting to view it, then i was hooked. in the same way that the tina turner story does, then this film enlightens you and allows you to see into the young performers life. the acting was superb and even after nearly 20 years after it was made, then the directional and the dialogue are still entertaining. i would recommend this to anyone who hasn\\'t yet watched it. it is amazingly accurate and emotionally charged. nothing is sacred. just ask ernie fosselius. these days, everybody has a video camera, and a movie is hardly out before the spoofs start flying, quickly written and shot, and often posted directly to the internet. spoofs are hot these days, and we go out of our way to make sure filmmakers don\\'t get off on their own self-importance. 25 years ago, when the first star wars was made, it was a different world. filmmaking was the playground of a select few and spoofs were very rare. then god gave us hardware wars. it was shot to look cheap (or was it just cheap?) and the audio was obviously recorded after the fact. does that take away from the experience? heck no! that\\'s what makes it so great! it was raw and unpolished, and hit relentlessly on some of the more pretentious moments of the original movie. from fluke starbucker waving around a flashlight instead of a lightsaber (i did that when i was young!) to chewchilla the wookie monster, to auggie ben doggie\\'s \"nah, just a little headache\" remark, this film short is as much a part of the phenomenon as any of the actual star wars films. rent it. buy it. borrow it from a friend. and may the farce be with you. always. i hated it. i hate self-aware pretentious inanity that masquerades as art. this film is either stupidly inane or inanely stupid. after the first half hour, i fastfowarded through the dvd version, and saw the same juvenile shennanigans over and over and over. i became angered that i had spent hard-earned money for sophomoric clap-trap. tinting drivel in sepia or blue does not make something a movie, let alone art. i usually try to be professional and constructive when i criticize movies, but my god!!! this was the worst movie i have ever seen. bad acting, bad effects, bad script, bad everything! the plot follows a group of teen cliche\\'s on their way to a rave (that takes place in broad daylight) at a remote island. however, when the group arrives, all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes. determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party-goers, the clan set\\'s off on a mission through a zombie-infested forest. during this crusade, they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids. they also meet up with jonathan cherry and some other survivors. basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequences including a far too long shootout outside of the \"house of the dead.\" this fight came complete with cheesy hollywood violence, redundant clips from the hotd video game, and sloppy matrix-esque camera rotations. one of the character\\'s even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others. why? not because he was noble and brave, but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled! i\\'m supposed to feel sorry for this guy?!? to sum it all up, there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is. the theater i was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and i\\'m sure the money i wasted seeing this piece of sh*t could easily cover the costs it took to make it. grade: f if you like me is going to see this in a film history class or something like that at your school, try to convince your teacher to see something else. believe me, anything is better than this movie. it is slow paced, confusing, boring, poorly constructed, gory, gringy, do i need to go on? it\\'s message is good, but i have seen them been handled better in several other films. the acting isn\\'t even any good. this movie is just even more awkward, as it start off as being funny (not intensional though)because of it\\'s surreal story, than at the end, just becomes uncomfortable to watch. i honestly feel like 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life has been robbed. why would anyone want to watch a girls describe a threesome for 10 minutes, than watch them drive through a traffic jam for 20 minutes, listen to a hippie who can make sheep appear, witness a sort of rape, than see the female lead role eat her husband. honestly this movie deserves nothing but a 1/10. and if your not happy with my preview,seriously i\\'m an open minded guy and i like movies that protest through symbolism, but this movie was just awful. make any excuse you can, to avoid this film. this is like a zoology textbook, given that its depiction of animals is so accurate. however, here are a few details that appear to have been slightly modified during the transition to film: - handgun bullets never hit giant komodo dragons. it doesn\\'t matter how many times you shoot at the komodo, bullets just won\\'t go near it. - the best way to avoid being eaten by a giant cobra, or a giant komodo dragon, is just to stand there. the exception to this rule is if you\\'ve been told to stay very still, in which case you should run off, until the komodo is right next to you, and then you should stand there, expecting defeat. - minutes of choppy slow motion footage behind the credits really makes for enjoyable watching. - $5,000 is a memory enhancement tool, and an ample substitute for losing your boating license/getting arrested. - members of elite army units don\\'t see giant komodo dragons coming until they are within one metre of the over-sized beings. maybe the computer-generated nature of these dragons has something to do with it. - when filming a news story aiming on exposing illegal animal testing, a reporter and a cameraman with one camera is all the gear and personnel you will need; sound gear, a second camera, microphones etc are all superfluous. - when you hear a loud animal scream, and one person has a gun, he should take it out and point it at the nearest person. - when you take a gun out, the sound of the safety being taken off will be made, even if your finger is nowhere near the safety - reporters agree to go half-way around the world in order to expose something - without having the faintest idea what they\\'re exposing. background research and vague knowledge are out of fashion in modern journalism. - handguns hold at least 52 bullets in one clip, and then more than that in the next clip. despite that, those with guns claim that they will need more ammo. - expensive cameras (also, remember that the reporter only has one camera) are regularly left behind without even a moment\\'s hesitation or regret. these cameras amazingly manage to make their way back to the reporter all by themselves. - the blonde girl really is the stupid one. - the same girl that says not to go into a house because a komodo dragon can easily run right through it, thus making it unsafe, takes a team into a building made of the same material for protection - and nobody says a word about it. - high-tech facilities look like simple offices with high school chemistry sets. - genetically-modified snakes grow from normal size to 100 feet long in a matter of a day, but don\\'t grow at all in the weeks either side. - the military routinely destroys entire islands when people don\\'t meet contact deadlines. - men with guns don\\'t necessarily change the direction they\\'re shooting when their target is no longer right in front of them. instead, they just keep shooting into the air. - the better looking you are, the greater your chance of surviving giant creatures. - women\\'s intuition is reliable enough to change even the most stubborn of minds. - any time you\\'re being hunted by giant creatures is a great time to hit on girls half your age. - animal noises are an appropriate masking noise for \\'swearing\\' at the same volume. - old israeli and russian planes are regularly used by the us military. this movie is awful, i can\\'t even be bothered to write a review on this garbage! all i will say it is one of the most boring films i\\'ve ever seen. and the acting is very bad. the boy who plays the main character really annoys me, he\\'s got the same expression on his face through out the movie. i just want to slap him! basically 80% of the movie is slow motion shots of skateboarders, weird music, and utter sh*t.. apparently i\\'ve got to write at least 10 lines of text to submit this comment, so i\\'ll use up a few more lines by saying the lead character has got one of those faces you just want to slap! meh i give up..this movie sucks !!!! why do movie makers always go against the author\\'s work? i mean, yes, things have to be condensed for the sake of viewer interest, but look at anne of green gables. they did a wonderful job of combining important events into a cohesive whole that was simply delightful. i can\\'t believe that they chose to combine three novels together for anne of avonlea into such a dreadful mess. look at all they missed out on by doing that . . . paul irving, little elizabeth, the widows, windy poplars . . . and anne\\'s college years, for heaven\\'s sake!!! wouldn\\'t it have been delightful to meet priscilla and all the rest of the redmond gang? kevin sullivan should have taken things one movie at a time, instead of jumbling them all together and combining characters and events the way he did. this movie was good, if you leave the novels out of it!! but l.m. montgomery\\'s beautiful work is something that should not be denied. this movie was a let down after seeing the successful way he brough anne of green gables to life. i can\\'t believe that those praising this movie herein aren\\'t thinking of some other film. i was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that\\'s also pointless. on the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you\\'ve got a sow\\'s ear to work with you can\\'t make a silk purse. ben g fans should stick with just about any other movie he\\'s been in. dorothy s fans should stick to galaxina. peter b fans should stick to last picture show and target. fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to peter b\\'s amazingly awful book, killing of the unicorn. this film really used its locations well with some amazing shots, dark and disturbing the film moves very slowly, but constantly keeps you watching. modern love worked well in the gold coast film fantastic program this year offering audiences a glimpse at an australian cinema that is usually neglected. most importantly it is refreshing to see australian cinema not taking on the clichã© aussie characters and story lines we have seen done to death over the years. this film would compliment any festival and will open debate after its screenings. the performances and characters are well developed, and the cinematography is fantastic. an interesting exploration into family relationships, and environments. strangely enough this movie never made it to the big screen in denmark, so i had to wait for the video release. my expectations where high but they where in no way disappointed. as always with ang lee there is fantastic acting, an intelligent and thrilling plot that has you guessing right till the end and superb filming. along with unforgiven this is easily one of the two best westerns of the 90`s. people who expect something along the line of mel gibson in the patriot(corny) or braveheart(acceptable) will be sourly disappointed, all others who appreciate the above mentioned qualities will have a fantastic time watching it. 9 out of 10. this film is so bad - dialogues, story, actors and actresses - everything! - that it\\'s hard to imagine that we\\'ll see a worse movie this year or in the following years. \"love\\'s brother\" (set in australia among italian immigrants) has nothing but shallow clichã©s about italian culture to offer, and it is quite telling that even the italians from and in italy speak english in the film. the message of the film - ugly people have to marry ugly people, beautiful people have to marry beautiful people - is truly discomforting. giovanni ribisi is quite good in films like \\'suburbia\\' or \\'lost in translation\\', but here his pseudo-italian accent is hard to bear. see this film at your own risk. trash as trash can! i don\\'t leave imdb comments about films but this.... this film was bad. very bad. i fast forwarded through most of it, stopping where i hoped the acting had improved since the last scene, only to continue with the fast forwards. formula plot -- once the obvious murderers were discounted, there was only the one left. and that was in the first five minutes. scene by scene it felt as though i\\'d already read the script before because there were no surprises, no mystery. the tori character... bad bad acting. a true waste of time on dvd and a definite \\'let\\'s go to bed early\\' option if it\\'s the only thing on television. if you watch this film, you will find yourself realising you\\'ll never be able to get back the time you\\'ve just wasted. in nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in pernambuco, antã´nio (gustavo falcã£o) is the youngest son of his mother, who had uninterruptedly cried for five years. when he is a young man, he falls in love for karina (mariana ximenes), a seventeen years old teenager that dreams to see the world and becomes an actress. antã´nio promises karina to bring the world to nordestina, and once in rio de janeiro, he participates of a sensationalist television show and promises to travel to the fifty years ahead in the future or die for love with a deadly machine he had invented. fifty years later, antã´nio (paulo autran) tries to fix what was wrong in his travel. \"a mã¡quina\" is one of the best brazilian movies i have recently seen. the refreshing and original story is a poetic and magic fable of love that will certainly thrill the most skeptical and tough viewer, in a unique romance. the direction is excellent; the screenplay is awesome; the cinematography and colors are magnificent; the cast leaded by gustavo falcã£o, the icon paulo autran and mariana ximenes is fantastic, with marvelous lines; the soundtrack has some beautiful brazilian songs highlighting geraldo azevedo and rento rocha\\'s \"dia branco\". if this movie is distributed overseas, please thrust me and rent it or buy the dvd because i bet you will love the story that will bring you into tears. my vote is nine. title (brazil): \"a mã¡quina â– o combustã\\xadvel ã© o amor\" (\"the machine â– the fuel is love\") \"i like cheap perfume better; it doesn\\'t last as long...\" - ralph meeker\\'s convict character (lawson) tells this to barbara stanwyck\\'s helen character, after he gets a whiff of the perfume that she picked out w/her husband in tijuana...! this line cracked me up, and also seemed like a metaphor for this film - that cheap is better than expensive, because a cheap perfume-loving man who has a way with a 2 x 4 is a better man to have around in the long run! i agree with some of the other comments posted about helen\\'s attraction to lawson. even though her narration states that she wants lawson to be put away, she did seem attracted to his fiery nature, and that passion he stirred up in her wouldn\\'t likely wash away with the tide! i am a huge fan of harald zwart, and i just knew that i had to see this movie, even though i can\\'t say i\\'m a soccer fan. but watching this just filled my heart with joy, and i had a great time in the movies watching it. bjã¸rn fast nagell does a tremendous job directing this movie, and even though you notice the main characters are new at acting, they grow with the movie and makes it what it is. even though it is supposed to be a soccer movie, there is surprisingly little soccer in it. the whole idea is to show the six guys making up the word n o r w a y on their trip to the world cup in soccer playing in germany this year. if you\\'re only gonna see one norwegian movie this year, this is the one.. based on the best-selling novel \"the dismissal\", the missing star, the latest film by acclaimed italian director gianni amelio, is the story of the growing friendship between an older italian maintenance man and a young interpreter he hires in shanghai to be his guide through china. vincenzo buonovolonta is the maintenance manager at a steel mill in italy that has been shut down and the blast furnace sold to china. when vincenzo (sergio castellitto) discovers that a control unit in the furnace is defective and potentially dangerous, he travels to china to find the steel mill where the part has been sold in hopes of preventing a fatal accident. the film, of course, is about the journey not the destination to use a familiar clichã© and, on that journey, we are privy to an engaging look at china with all its immense beauty and complexity, via the outstanding cinematography by luca bigazzi. the film takes us to shanghai, wuhan, chongquing, baotou, and a trip along the yangstze river showing us coastal areas that are scheduled to be flooded when the three gorges dam is fully operative, a chinese mega-project that has resulted in the displacement of 1.2 million people. the trip brings the travelers face to face with poverty, overcrowded housing, and children left to fend for themselves. the film revolves around the relationship between vincenzo and translator liu hua (tai ling) who first meet in italy where his impatience with her translations at a dinner meeting causes her to lose her job. when he tracks her down in shanghai she is working at a library and resistant to vincenzo\\'s approach. looking at his offer to help him in his travels in china as little more than a well paying job, she reluctantly agrees to accompany him. their relationship, however, grows as they move from city to city, her interpretive skills much in evidence to help the bewildered vincenzo who does not own a cell phone. as they slowly open up to each other, they expose each other\\'s vulnerability and the film delves into their past and present life and how they arrived at their present situation. we meet liu\\'s son (lin wang) at the home of her grandmother. in china\\'s one child policy, he is one of the unwanted children who have been \"hidden\" since the father of the boy abandoned the family. although the meeting between vincenzo and the boy is casual, their relationship becomes central to how the story plays out. castellitto is an excellent actor (though one longs for a younger enrico lo verso in this role). however, he is emotionally distant throughout the film, his expression rarely changing from a far away hangdog expression. though tai ling brings a great deal of presence to the role, her relationship with the much older vincenzo never seemed real to me and the ending seemed to exist only in a reality known as the movies. though amelio is one of my favorite directors, coming on the heels of the brilliant keys to the house, missing star is a disappointment. this is sad this movie is the tops this should at least be in the top 250 movies here. this is still the best action movie ever done. the action movies of today are badly done the actors and action directors do not no how to do it fighting and stunts properly. only some no how to do it mostly from hong kong like jackie chan. the stunts are so clever and wild i do not think we will see the likes of ever. the start where chan and his team go down the hill car chase through the hill town is just amazing. the end fight stunts are for me the best fight stunts ever put to film. the end stunt sliding down the pole crashing through the glass jackie was badly hurt. i found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial 5 minutes of the film. i managed to stomach 45-50 minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching monster house instead (which, by the way, is great fun). the story has massive holes in it. the plot line is hugely over stated and dull, the acting is awful, especially from justin timberlake who should really stick to what he is good at (looking daft and singing like a castrato). morgan freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable, especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and timberlake meet. freeman and timberlake\\'s characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of father/son relationship of sorts or something, which simply isn\\'t evident at all apart from the fact that; though freeman\\'s character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of timberlake, he never the less pulls out all the stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover up. it would take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line, which is simply absurd and blown out of all proportion. don\\'t watch this film, it is a pure waste of time. this movie is a real low budget production, yet i will not say anything more on that as it already has been covered. i give this movie a low rating for the story alone, but i met the director the night i saw the film and he gave me an additional reason to dislike the movie. he asked me how i enjoyed it and i told him that it was not easy to like. my main objection was the lack of foundation for the relationship between the two main characters, i was never convinced that they were close. i also told him that the scene where the main characters were presented as children becoming friends was too late in the film. he told me that the flashback scenes were not in the original script. that they were added because he felt like i did that the two main characters did not appear close. he went on to explain that these scenes were not filmed to his satisfaction as they were out of money. i agree that they did not do much for the film. another fact about the movie, that i was not aware of, is the actor who had the lead wrote the script based on his own personal experience. this is usually a bad move as some writers do not take into consideration the emotional reaction the viewer. the story is so close to home that the writer make too many assumption as to the audience\\'s reaction to his own tragedy. and the story is tragic. however, it did not work for me as i never cared for any of the characters, least of all the lead. what was presented were two evil people out to make a buck by any means, regardless who gets hurt. when ms. young\\'s character decides to give up he evil ways, it appears that she does so because she is ineffective, not because she knows she is doing wrong. if the movie has a message then i suspect that only the writer is aware of it. i watch this movie without big expectations, i think everyone should do. it\\'s a great tv-serie and of course we couldn\\'t compare it with gone with the wind, but it\\'s still nice to watch. it\\'s also weird to see a different scarlett. joanne whalley don\\'t play scarlett with passion and fire like vivien leigh, but i believe that scarlett is changed when she became older. don\\'t expect to much of this just watch but don\\'t watch like: i think this would be horrible. what a fun filled, sexy movie! they certainly don\\'t make them like this anymore. 4 sexy au pairs arrive in london and have all sorts of sexual misadventures. the tone is oddly innocent, as the considerable nudity evolves out of stock farcical situations, rather than any overt sexual desire on the part of the characters. it is only when the actresses accidentally lose their clothes that the male characters become rampant. richard o\\' sullivan literally gets \\'randi\\'(sic). the film certainly betrays the origins of the softcore feature as lying in the nudie cuties and naturism films of the old school. my special interest in \\'au pair girls\\' is that i am a huge fan of gabrielle drake. if any actress has ever looked better naked (she\\'s slim but wonderfully curvy), or clothed, come to that (i\\'ve loved her since the original run of ufo - who else could carry off a purple wig!), i\\'ll eat my hat. jackass number two is easily the most hilarious film of 2006, beating the also hilarious clerks ii. it is one of the best sequels in recent memory, beating jackass the movie in every way. now, this film may be the funniest, but it is also the most offensive, appalling, and utterly disgusting. you will find yourself feeling sick several times throughout the film. i\\'m completely serious when i say don\\'t eat anything before watching or during this film, because chances are that it will literally come back to haunt you. keep the drinking to a minimum as well. you\\'ve been warned, because, just like the tagline says, it will make you beg for mercy. jackass number two follows the crazy men from the hit show jackass, johnny knoxville, bam margera, ryan dunn, steve-o, chris \\'party boy\\' pontius, preston lacy, ehren mcghehey, dave england, brandon dicamillo, and jason \\'wee man\\' acuna (chris \\'raab himself\\' raab is absent) as they perform the most outrageous, life-threatening, and revolting stunts imaginable. i\\'m not going to tell what the stunts are, but i will warn you that any scene with an animal will be sickening or psychologically frightening, and that one cast member (once again, not telling) will flirt with death several times in the film. what makes jackass number two so entertaining is not the stunts themselves, but how the cast reacts to them and to doing them. to put it simple, if they loved doing it and had a blast, you will too (this goes for 99% of the stunts). all the stunts are very original, and 90% of them are never-before-seen. you will witness a few recycled ones, but they\\'re amped up. you wouldn\\'t think directing really factors into a movie like this, but it does; jeff tremaine\\'s direction makes the movie so much funnier, because he provides guidance for the gang in their comedic timing, which is simply brilliant on his part. he could have just sat back and slept throughout filming (actually, you\\'ll see in the film that he did sleep through some filming), but he went out there and helped these crazy guys make the stunts as funny as he could. i give mr. tremaine two thumbs up for that. another great thing about jackass is its bonanza of celebrity cameos, and this time they include bmx legend mat hoffman, skateboard god tony hawk, director/actor jay chandrasekhar (super troopers & beerfest), actor luke wilson, miami dolphins star jason taylor, and director/actor mike judge (office space). the scenes with hoffman, taylor, and chandrasekhar are among the funniest in the film, as it\\'s even funnier to see these men as a part of the film. jackass number two is one of the most politically incorrect, morally degrading, and just plain wrong movies of all time, if not the most. despite this, it is so original and so hilarious that you won\\'t care about that. you\\'ll be gasping for air, laughing so hard you\\'ll be crying, and jumping out of your seat laughing throughout the entire film. due to the explicit and potentially disturbing graphic content of this film, no one under 18 should watch this film. you\\'ve been warned. i hope you enjoy jackass number two as much as i did. 10/10 --spy turn your backs away or you\\'re gonna get in big trouble out of my boyfriend\\'s back! only a happy ending can bloom your innocence that is full of gloom and doom at the very moment you\\'re watching this. it\\'s safe to say that the entire movie falls apart, with a sarcastic approach and tribute to zombie shows that defy nonsense to the max. we get a name like \"johnny\" every so often, and this \"johnny\" has nowhere to go. there isn\\'t a specific reason to why our \"dead corpse\" crawls out of his grave just to survive until prom night, so that renders the movie totally useless. without a feeling of sorrow, his mother is convinced to tell the doctor that he\\'s dead. johnny takes a bite out of eddie\\'s arm afterwards. the viewer is asked a tough question: why does the movie have to be this cornball? there is an answer. any resemblance to all persons living or dead is purely coincidental. \"living\" is a coincidence. \"dead\" has nothing in common with the movie. show this one to your girlfriend and she\\'ll skip the senior prom, turning your life into a deserted ruin. blah!!! i remember the events of this movie, the ill fated cruise of donald crowhurst in 1968, in the golden globe single handed around the world yacht race. i was a 13 year old, living in england. the previous year francis chichester (later sir francis; he was knighted for his exploits) had completed the first solo circumnavigation of the globe. i remember it mostly because we were given time off school to watch his return (on a grainy black and white tv!) and then his knighting by the queen. it provoked a huge outpouring of patriotic fervor in the uk. it all seems so quaint now. chichester became a national hero, but he had stopped half way, in australia, to re-fit his yacht, so the next logical step for yachtsmen was to attempt the journey without stopping. it\\'s important to remember that this was a world pre-gps, when communications on land were still pretty erratic, never mind in the middle of the ocean. now with gps receivers that fit on a key chain and calculate a position within a metre anywhere on earth, it\\'s hard to recall a time when you could go to sea and quite literally, vanish. as donald crowhurst did. a number of yachtsmen signed up (all men back then), including mystery man, crowhurst. essentially a weekend sailor, crowhurst had not been a spectacular success in any previous enterprise, including careers in the british army, the air force and as an electronics entrepreneur selling navigation aids. he wanted to do something big with his life, and he saw the five thousand pound first prize (well over $100,000 in today\\'s money) and the ensuing publicity as a means of kick starting his business. he signed a deal with a sponsor that proved more watertight than his boat, and which meant failure would bankrupt him, and soon found himself a popular figure with journalists as he prepared for the race. now the brits always love the idea of the gutsy amateur taking on the \\'pros\\'. (think eddie the eagle losing endless olympic ski jump competitions, and the amateur riders who regularly start the grand national horse race.) the public queued up to see him set off, but his boat wasn\\'t really ready, and even as he started (the last competitor to leave the uk) crowhurst must have known he didn\\'t seriously have a chance. but too much was riding on him to quit. in the wonderful archive footage we see doubt written all over his poor wife\\'s face. left behind with their 4 children, she is interviewed movingly throughout the film, together with one of crowhurst\\'s sons. she was in a no-win situation. had she attempted to stop him, she would have been considered a spoiler, but afterward she was riven with doubt, as to whether she could have saved his life by stopping him. faced with the certain truth that his boat was leaking and would never make it through the southern oceans, and unable to turn around and face ridicule, bankruptcy and ignominy, crowhurst devised a plan to cheat. laid up offshore argentina and brazil, out of radio contact, he waited for the leaders to round cape horn and start back up the atlantic, thinking he could sneak in at the end of the line and pretend he had sailed all the way around the globe. he elaborately falsified his logs, and made 16mm films and audio recordings to back up his plan. but as one after another the other competitors dropped out, he realized that in fact he would come in 2nd and his logs would be scrutinized. unable to face certain detection, his journal suggests he lost his grip on reality and eventually committed suicide. his yacht was found. he never was. this beautifully edited film also follows the journey of bernard moitessier, an experienced and enigmatic french sailor, who was in second place and certain of the fastest journey prize, when he abruptly left the race, unable to deal with the clamour and publicity he knew he would face, and sailed into the wide blue yonder, eventually pulling up some 10 months later in tahiti. having spent some seven years working at sea myself, (albeit on very different ships to these) i well understand the pull of the ocean. standing on deck, seeing water in every direction to the horizon, knowing there\\'s a couple of miles of water below you, nothing between you and oblivion but a thin metal hull, without easy access to tv or radio (even nowadays on most working ships, you feel pretty isolated), it\\'s possible to truly escape from the responsibilities of everyday life for a while. there is some thoughtful analysis of what drives people to attempt this kind of very long, lonely journey and the effect it has on the human mind. most people would think that attempting to raise 4 children is adventure enough, but much is made of the need for self discovery in the hardships at sea, the search for self. i strongly suspect that robin knox johnston, the ex navy guy who won the race (and many since) probably knew pretty well who he was before he set off, which was why he succeeded not just in winning the race but also retaining his sanity en route. those who went searching for something profound within themselves, may not have entirely liked what they found. the marvelous archive footage of britain in the late 60s is almost reason enough to watch this, (did it really look quite that bad? i don\\'t remember it looking quite so dowdy, but perhaps we blot out the worst aspects of the past?) but overall, it is an excellently well made and engrossing movie. highly recommended. \"ally mcbeal\" was a decent enough show, but it was very overrated. the characters become boring after a while and the jokes begin to fall short. i think it chose an appropriate point in time to leave - it was starting to outstay its welcome. bad, ambient sound. lots of shuffling. loooong pointless scenes. eg: guy sees interesting woman in lobby. manages to stay there and watch her under the guise of waiting for the building supervisor to get a package. says nothing. stares creepily. more shuffling and other irritating ambient noise. wait. wait. wait. guy says nothing. woman looks frightened or at least slightly disturbed about it and rightly so. manager comes back with package. guy goes up to the apartment with the package. another example: the guy and his host sit around watching bad tv. more ambient noise and shuffling. wait wait wait wait. guy wanders off to bed. if you can stand to sit through any more of this movie, you get to watch them watch tv again later. if you want a story, any dialogue, entertainment, or a well crafted film, look elsewhere. okay so i love aidan quinn\\'s acting even with a bad script. this is not the case in the assignment. as other viewers have said, this was a movie i stumbled upon on cable and got so into it i didn\\'t want it to end. take one cuban american navy ofc.(quinn)who is an upright, uptight soldier and family man. add a crazed agent(donald sutherland) who is looking for the worlds most notorious terrorist and add a ben kingsley and you have \"the assignment\". sutherland is a witness of the most notorious terrorist carlos actions in a cafe on a lovely day where he is so profoundly rocked at this mans evil that his sole reason to live is to get this man as long as he draws breath. take one soldier on a pass in israel who is a dead ringer for this man and is beaten and held by kingsley until they realize they have a plan. by taking on carlos by being him, or being forever responsible for never helping rid the world of him, makes for a very heavy assignment and guilt trip. by not helping his country he is bound as a man and his military duty to chose wisely. so the training begins. lets say carlos training is right up there with the academy of arts and holocausts. when i say this intense and wonderfully casted,scripted and executed film rates the best, i am not understating it. all three actors could save almost any script..together this is a movie to be seen from frame one to credits. i am not into terrorism or movies about it but i got hooked! bravo again to aidan quinn who for once plays a heavy that could hold up to any actor including gary oldman. thats a compliment. rent it and get lots of popcorn. oh did i mention the sex?? it works better than \"last tango!\"and its educational. you remember the spice girls movie and how bad it was (besides the songs), well their manager simon fuller (also this band\\'s manager) makes the same error putting s club (another of my favourite bands) in their own film. s club: tina barrett, jon lee, bradley mcintosh, jo o\\'meara, hannah spearritt and rachel stevens (what happened to the seventh member, paul cattermole?) basically ask their boss for a break, they go on, and while there they see themselves on tv! three of them swap, and vice versa, half discover they are clones made by a greedy scientist, and the other half just get themselves in trouble. also starring gareth gates as a clone of himself. this film may have more of a plot than spice girls\\' film did, but besides the songs \"bring it all back\", \"don\\'t stop movin\\'\" and \"never had a dream come true\" this is no goo reason to see this film. not too long after the band split for good. adequate! i saw sea of dust as part of a nyc screening audience several years ago. i enjoyed the film at that time, so i was a little confused by some of the amendments that had been made since. perhaps it\\'s my memory, but there seemed to be chunks of exposition missing from the version that was shown at the rhode island film festival. i\\'m really not sure which version i prefer, but i can honestly say that i found something to appreciate it both. let me begin by warning everyone that this is not a popcorn movie. although it\\'s been promoted as a hammer films tribute, people expecting a showdown between van helsing and dracula are going to be sorely disappointed. there\\'s some cleavage, but no nudity (a staple of the british production house\\'s later movies). and while sea of dust is filled with gorgeous eye candy (it really is shot like a sixties film), and features hammer starlet ingrid pitt, it\\'s not like any of the company\\'s pictures in tone or execution. this film is very dark, very confusing, and (at times) very funny. i don\\'t remember the earlier version being quite as nutty as this one, but that\\'s not a bad thing (especially the showdown in the black forest that plays like a three stooges short). and some of ms pitt\\'s rantings are quite entertaining. it\\'s like somebody wound her up and turned her loose. the uniqueness of this film doesn\\'t lie with the borrowed details, though. it\\'s in the ideas. as an occasional sci fi channel viewer, i\\'ve regularly taken the network to task for its one-note variations on a theme (cgi monster kills, then gets destroyed). sea of dust is so full of ideas that you start to trip over them after a while. but don\\'t get me wrong. i\\'m not complaining. if anything, i applaud these guys for making such an enterprising low-budget picture and for having the courage to pack it with so many concepts. it\\'s not going to be a picnic for people who hate to think at the movies (you know who you are). but for the rest of us, those of us who are tired of the formula of modern horror films, the predictability, the lack of respect for the audience, this may just be your ticket. this is a good time to say how good i think of this site: it gives me the opportunity to feedback all the frustration i lived for two hours, awaiting for something to happens, for something to be said, to be shown, to be insinuated subtly, for a symbol, an idea, whatever. no, just long, endless violins, alternated by a tired piano. tired voices, tired actors and bored characters and situations. boring is the long death of the mind, and this movie is, from that point of view, a public enemy. how many thousands of live hours will be still stolen to another thousands of innocent spectators. i don\\'t claim for my money back, just for my time and the time of persons i invited to watch this thing... oh god ! i\\'m a christian. i have always been skeptical about movies made by christians, however. as a rule, they are \"know-nothings\" when it comes to movie production. i admire tbn for trying to present god and jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen. however, they did a hideous job of it. the acting was horrible, and unless one is familiar with the bible in some fashion, one could not have understood what the movie was trying to get across. not only was the movie terribly made, but the people who made it even had some facts wrong. however, in this \"critique\", those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into. in short, the omega code is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen, and i would not recommend it to anyone, except for comic relief from the every day grind. having finally caught up with this \"masterpiece,\" it strikes me that it must have seemed terribly clever, in its day. it\\'s french, arty, under-played to the point of agony, and ultimately downbeat. but viewed from the vantage of 37 years in the future, it\\'s also just a bit vacuous, pretentious and unsatisfying. others have summarized the story, but i don\\'t think anyone has pointed out the dramatic flaw at the heart of this film: the lead characters, corey and vogel, really don\\'t deserve what they get. they play square within their code, never harm anyone who didn\\'t ask for it, and show great courage and initiative. moreover, corey in particular is victimized by his former gangland \\'friend,\\' who stole his girl and who repeatedly tries to have him killed, apparently just because he (corey) dared to \\'borrow\\' a few thousand francs. these are guys who really ought to be due for a break! instead, things go far worse for them than they really need to, within the logic of the story. one might contend that this is the whole point: that the real villains never get caught; that they collude with the police as needed, sell out their friends, and always come out on top. but that\\'s not shown either. corey\\'s old gangster friend is not shown colluding with the police. nor is he shown gloating over his victory. in fact, after materializing several times when he\\'s needed, he\\'s nowhere to be seen at the conclusion, leaving a dramatic tension (his feud with corey) entirely unresolved! nonetheless, i\\'d say this film is well worth seeing for its beautiful photography, its slow, deliberate pacing, its great deadpan performances, its elaborate heist sequence, and its encapsulation of the art-film style of the late 1960s. thoughtless, ignorant, ill-conceived, career-killing (where is the talented angela jones now?), deeply unfunny garbage. it\\'s no wonder reb braddock hasn\\'t directed anything else since - anyone who has a chance to make his first film on his own rules, based on his own script, with the help of quentin tarantino himself, and creates something like this, anyone who feels that this was a story worth telling to the world, doesn\\'t deserve a second break. under the circumstances, the performances are good - the actors do what they\\'re told to do, and they do it well. it\\'s just that they shouldn\\'t have done it in the first place. 0 out of 4. jim carrey is one of the funniest and most gifted comedians in film today. with his hyperactive spontaneity and his rubber face he can just go crazy, and we love him for it. he has the ability to make mediocre comedies (ala ace ventura), and turn them into decent comedic outings. or, in the case of \\'liar liar\\', make them some of the most hilarious contemporary comedies around. carrey has also proven himself capable of tackling dramas. he was excellent in both \\'man on the moon\\' and \\'the truman show.\\' the guy is remarkable. then comes \\'bruce almighty,\\' an ideal vehicle for carrey, and a premise that should have worked; carrey, after complaining about god and how his life stinks, is enabled with god\\'s powers. however, the script is pure recycled garbage. now, no matter how bad a script is, carrey\\'s improvisation alone sometimes makes an unfunny scene funny. the problem is that there are very few opportunities for carrey to be unleashed because so much of the comedy relies on silly special effects, only some of which are amusing. carrey is rarely able to improvise because he has to work around the special effects. the writers apparently thought that all these special effects and superpower sequences were funny, because the rest of the movie is simply filler giving carrey nothing else to work with besides a whiny character who is absolutely humorless. he seems more like a 5-year yearning for our attention, wanting the viewer to find what he is doing funny, when it\\'s really just annoying. i have always enjoyed jennifer aniston on \\'friends\\' and she was superb in last year\\'s \\'the good girl.\\' she too has a gift for comedy, but with the script as linear as it is, she is simply given the part of the bitter girlfriend. she comes across as nagging, grumpy, and there is no chemistry between the two stars. \\'bruce almighty\\' should have been a comedy that works. but it doesn\\'t even have the guts to tackle the subject matter that it\\'s making fun of; religion. a few minor giggles (his internet is yehweh), but instead it\\'s just turned into a comedic superpower comedy. not to mention that it\\'s tone shifts from silly to heavy-handed, and even black comedy at times. the movie fails on nearly every level. that\\'s not to see it is entirely devoid of laughs, but it\\'s close. any movie that feels the need to incorporate scenes of a dog peeing to get it\\'s laughs has problems. but hey, if you find pee jokes funny, go for it. shameless screen entertainment is a relatively new and british (i think) dvd-label, specializing in smutty and excessively violent cult movies â– mostly italian ones - from the glorious eras when everything was possible, namely from the late 60\\'s up until the mid-80\\'s. the label\\'s selection feels like a crossover between the oeuvres of \"mondo macabro\" and \"no shame\" (they probably even borrowed the name of the latter) and they already released some really rare sick italian puppies like \"ratman\", \"my dear killer\", \"killer nun\", \"phantom of death\" and \"torso\". \"the frightened woman\" was completely unknown to me, but since fellow reviewers from around here, whose opinions i hugely value, described it as one of the greatest and most mesmerizing psychedelic euro-sexploitation movies of its era, i didn\\'t hesitate to pick it up. this is a very weird film and probably not suitable for about 99% of the average cinema-loving audiences. if you\\'re part of that remaining 1%, however, you\\'re in for a really unique treat. the style, atmosphere and content are similar to jess franco\\'s \"succubus\" and massimo dallamano\\'s \"venus in furs\", yet they\\'re both widely considered as classics whereas \"the frightened woman\" is virtually unknown. it\\'s all a matter of profiling and good marketing, i guess. the story revolves on a literally filthy rich doctor (he lives in a gigantic secluded mansion, owns multiple old-timer cars and has a very impressive collection of artsy relics including a life-size mannequin doll replica of himself) with a bizarre and slightly offbeat attitude towards women. he considers them a threat for the survival of the male race and thus spends his days kidnapping, humiliating and sexually abusing random he picks up from the street. dr. sayer then abducts the ambitious journalist maria with the intention to completely crush her female spirit, but he slowly falls for her. just he starts to believe in actual love, she strikes back with a vengeance. this really isn\\'t for everyone, but if you can appreciate moody & sinisterly sexy ambiances, bizarre scenery toys and psychedelic touches that seem utterly implausible and surreal, you can consider this one a top recommendation. it\\'s slow, stylishly sleazy and totally bonkersâ… shameless entertainment, all right! the key scene in rodrigo garcia\\'s \"nine lives\" comes when sissy spacek, hidden away in a hotel room where she is carrying on an affair with aiden quinn, find a nature documentary on television, at which point quinn notes the contrivance of such things--disparate footage is edited into one scene, predators and preys are thrown together in order to capture the moment--all to force connections where none actually exist. characters in the nine shorts that make up this film occasionally spill over into each others stories, but none of them ever seem to really connect. a woman preparing for a violent confrontation with her abusive father is later seen working in a hospital room where another woman is preparing for a mastectomy. a man who runs into an old girlfriend in a supermarket and sees how his life should have been later hosts, with his current wife, a dinner party for an unhappy couple. garcia arranges some of his characters in front of each other, but none of the subsequent stories ever really build on what came before. garcia\\'s first film, the wonderful, overlooked \"things you can tell just by looking at her,\" also had a short-story structure and overlapping characters, but there were fewer of them and they had a lot more room to breathe and grow. the gimmicky premise of \"nine lives,\" that each of its nine stories is told in a single, unbroken take in real time, never allows the film to build up any real dramatic tension or momentum. it\\'s also a fairly visually ugly movie. interior shots are often murky and hard to watch, while other scenes--particularly one where a girl walks back and forth between rooms to talk to her uncommunicative parents--are rendered annoying by the camera-work. given that this is garcia\\'s third film and that he has a respectable history of directing for television, the direction in this film is rather surprisingly amateurish. like fellow filmmaker-child-of-a-great-writer rebecca miller, garcia (son of gabriel garcia marquez) is focused on the writing and character aspects of his films often to the detriment of the film-making ones. individual scenes are touching and even affecting. i did like jason issacs kissing robin wright penn\\'s pregnant belly. and joe mantegna whispering lovingly to his wife as she slips into pre-surgery sedation. and sissy spacek stealing a few happy moments away from her life with aiden quinn before brought back to it with a phone call from her daughter. but the film (unlike \"things you can tell just by looking at her\") feels more like an exercise than actual drama. we are just watching people act. minor plot spoilers ahead!!! how did such talented actors get involved in such mindless retreaded drivel? robert deniro plays a dumb hollywood version of the standard violence prone tough cop (i.e., he beats up the bad guys and rolls his eyes at cops who prefer to stick by the book), and eddie murphy plays a not so tough cop who would rather be an actor (i.e., he screams out, \"freeze, police!\" and has his \"tough look\" down pat). naturally, they are partnered when bobby\\'s loose cannon tactics get him in hot water with the media and he is essentially blackmailed into starring in a \"cops\"-like reality show. take a breath, cuz that\\'s as funny as it gets. no energy was put into the script - it feels like a pale retread of every copy buddy movie tossed into a blender with \"15 minutes\" starring, yes, deniro himself as, pretty much the character he is playing here. the jokes fall flat, the action feels listless, and no one seems to be having a good time. it\\'s dead on the screen. please don\\'t waste your time. even if you have an overwheming affinity for one of the actors - avoid it and do them a favor. becauze if this makes money, these kinda of scripts will be deeemed perfectly acceptable for actors of their quality. and to mr. deniro. you used to make serious films. i remember them - they were good. you were nominated for awards for them - remember how much fun that was? now after \"analyze this\" (which was good), \"meet the parents\" (which was also good), and \"the adventures of rocky and bullwinkle\" (which was not good), i think we need to see you parodying yourself less, and being yourself more. \"casino\" feels like a long time ago. and no, i don\\'t count \"15 minutes\" as serious bobby. anyone who took that media satire seriously must get their weekly world news i can\\'t really see how anyone can have any interest whatsoever in seeing this movie. a woman meets a man, he wants to play games, she too, but only until she realise what she\\'s missing. she leaves, and that\\'s it really. it took 9 1/2 weeks before elizabeth (kim basinger) left john (mickey rourke). she should have left him after 30 minutes and ended our misery. a major disappointment. this was one of the best uk crime drama / detective shows from the 90\\'s which developed the fascinating title character played by scotland\\'s robbie coltrane. however this one-off has little to add and perhaps suffers from an inevitable let down due to raised expectations when a favored show returns after a long hiatus. coltrane isn\\'t really given much to do, much more attention is spent on the uninteresting killer, and in what he has to act in, he seems uninvolved, almost bored. the ex-soldier\\'s story is written by the books and the attempt to update us on coltrane\\'s family life seems lightweight. perhaps if the writers had a whole series in front of them instead of just this one two-hour show they would have written this with much more depth. as is, skip this and watch the old cracker from the 90\\'s which is far far superior. i saw this movie only because sophie marceau. however, her acting abilities it\\'s no enough to salve this movie. almost all cast don\\'t play their character well, exception for sophie and frederic. the plot could give a rise a better movie if the right pieces was in the right places. i saw several good french movies but this one i don\\'t like. ok, how\\'s this for original- this mean, rich old geezer leaves his estate to his adult children, all of them ungrateful losers, and two creepy servants, provided they spend the week in his spooky old house. what happens that night will surprise only those who haven\\'t seen a movie or television show before. after a string of murders in which the victims look like they\\'re bleeding restaurant ketchup, we have a painfully obvious twist ending. the cast is lead by some once respectable actors must have been desperate for their paychecks. there are also a few second-tier actors who were rising at the time but long forgotten now. as a result, the film generates all the drama and mystery of an episode of \"matlock.\" i will give credit where it\\'s due- the closing scene is clever and amusing, if you\\'re still awake. l\\'auberge espagnole is full of energy, and it\\'s honest, realistic, and refreshing. not a comedy or drama but more a slice of life movie about this particular group of very interesting but still normal young people who share an apartment in barcelona for one year. beautifully photographed with a nice soundtrack. if you\\'re older, this movie should bring back a flood of good memories. if you\\'re young, learn by this example. make sure you make this delightful comedy part of your holiday season! if you admire dennis morgan or barbara stanwyck, this film is a fun one to watch. they really work well together as you would see in this movie. the whole cast was very entertaining. since i\\'m a dennis morgan fan, this film was a real treat! but...everyone can enjoy it! recommended! \" sã¥ som i himmelen \" .. as above so below.. that very special point where divine and human meet. i adore this film ! a gem. yes amazing grace ! i was so deeply moved by its very human quality. i laughed and cried through a whole register , indeed several octaves of emotions. mikael nyqvist ã\\xads brilliant as daniel , a first rate passionate performance, charismatic and powerful. his inner light and exceptional talent shines through in every scene, every interaction ,in every meeting. i was totally mesmerised, enchanted and caught up the story, which is our collective story, the story of life itself. the film was also so inclusive of many archetypes, messiah, wounded child ,magical child, artist, teacher, priest, abuser, abused, victim, bully, divine fool - all the characters so real and true to life - all awakened great fondness and compassion in me. it is a real treat to see such a thought provoking yet thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining film. oh ..mustn\\'t forget the heavenly choir of angels and breathtakingly beautiful sound. thank you all - this swedish film will surely captivate people world-wide. brilliant ! at the height of the \\'celebrity big brother\\' racism row in 2007 ( involving shilpa shetty and the late jade goody ), i condemned on an internet forum those \\'c.b.b.\\' fans who praised the show, after years of bashing \\'racist\\' \\'70\\'s sitcoms such as \\'curry & chips\\' & \\'love thy neighbour\\'. i thought they were being hypocritical, and said so. \\'it ain\\'t half hot mum\\' was then thrown into the argument, with some pointing out it had starred an english actor blacked-up. well, yes, but michael bates had lived in india as a boy, and spoke urdu fluently. the show\\'s detractors overlook the reality he brought to his performance as bearer \\'rangi ram\\'. the noted indian character actor, renu setna, said in a 1995 documentary \\'perry & croft: the sitcoms\\' that he was upset when he heard bates had landed the role, but added: \"no indian actor could have played that role as well as bates.\". indeed. \\'mum\\' was perry and croft\\'s companion show to \\'dad\\'s army\\'; also set in wartime, the sedate english town of walmington-on-sea had been replaced by the hot, steamy jungles of india, in particularly a place called deolali, where an army concert party puts on shows for the troops, among them bombadier solomons ( george layton, his first sitcom role since \\'doctor in charge\\' ), camp gunner \\'gloria\\' beaumont ( melvyn hayes ), diminutive gunner \\'lofty\\' sugden, \\'lah de-dah\\' gunner graham ( john clegg ), and gunner parkins ( the late christopher mitchell ). presiding over this gang of misfits was the bellicose sergeant-major williams ( the brilliant windsor davies ), who regarded them all as \\'poofs\\'. his frustration at not being able to lead his men up the jungle to engage the enemy in combat made him bitter and bullying ( though he was nice to parkins, whom he thought was his illegitimate son! ). then there was ever-so english colonel reynolds ( donald hewlett ) and dimwitted captain ashwood ( michael knowles ). rangi was like a wise old sage, beginning each show by talking to the camera and closing them by quoting obscure hindu proverbs. he loved being bearer so much he came to regard himself as practically british. his friends were the tea-making char wallah ( the late dino shafeek, who went on to \\'mind your language\\' ) and the rope pulling punka wallah ( babar bhatti ). so real indians featured in the show - another point its detractors ignore. shafeek also provided what was described on the credits as \\'vocal interruptions\\' ( similar to the \\'40\\'s songs used as incidental music on \\'dad\\'s army\\' ). each edition closed with him warbling \\'land of hope & glory\\' only to be silenced by a \\'shut up!\\' from williams. the excellent opening theme was penned by jimmy perry and derek taverner. though never quite equalling \\'dad\\'s army\\' in the public\\'s affections, \\'mum\\' nevertheless was popular enough to run for a total of eight seasons. in 1975, davies and estelle topped the charts with a cover version of that old chestnut \\'whispering grass\\'. they then recorded an entire album of old chestnuts, entitled ( what else? ) \\'sing lofty!\\'. the show hit crisis point three years later when bates died of cancer. rather than recast the role of \\'rangi\\', the writers just let him be quietly forgotten. when george layton left, the character of \\'gloria\\' took his place as \\'bombadier\\', providing another source of comedy. the last edition in 1981 saw the soldiers leave india by boat for blighty, the char wallah watching them go with great sadness ( as did viewers ). repeats have been few and far between ( mainly on u.k. gold ) all because of its so-called \\'dodgy\\' reputation. this is strange. for one thing, the show was not specifically about racism. if a white man blacked-up is so wrong, why does david lean\\'s 1984 film \\'a passage to india\\' still get shown on television? ( it featured alec guinness as an indian, and won two oscars! ). it was derived from jimmy perry\\'s own experiences. some characters were based on real people ( the sergeant-major really did refer to his men as \\'poofs\\' ). i take the view that if you are going to put history on television, get it right. sanitizing the past, no matter how unsavoury it might seem to modern audiences, is fundamentally dishonest. \\'mum\\' was both funny and truthful, and viewers saw this. thank heavens for d.v.d.\\'s i say. time to stop this review. as williams would say: \"i\\'ll have no gossiping in this jungle!\" i am from texas, and live very close to plano where the actual deaths occurred, so i might be a bit biased in saying that \"wasted\" is a film that you just can\\'t get out of your head. stahl, phoenix, and paul all play their characters very realistically. you truly believe that they are everyday high school students who just happen to be heroin addicts. the drug content is handled very graphically as well - although everything that happens in the film serves a purpose, and each moment the characters spiral further downward is heartbreaking. i definitely recommend this film to anyone. once you watch it, it sticks with you! mukhsin is a beautiful movie about a first love story. everyone probably has one, and this is writer-director yasmin ahmad\\'s story of hers, with a boy called mukhsin. we know that her movies have been semi-autobiographical of sorts, having scenes drawn upon her personal experiences, and it is indeed this sharing and translating of these emotions to the big screen, that has her films always exude a warm sincerity and honesty. mukhsin is no different, and probably the most polished ad confident work to date (though i must add, as a personal bias, that sepet still has a special place in my heart). our favourite family is back - pak atan, mak inom, orked and kak yam, though this time, we go back to when orked is age 10. the characters are all younger from the movies we\\'ve journeyed with them, from rabun to gubra, and here, sharifah amani\\'s sisters sharifah aryana and sharifah aleya take on the roles of orked and mak inom respectively, which perhaps accounted for their excellent chemistry together on screen, nevermind that their not playing sibling roles. the only constant it seems is kak yam, played by adibah noor, and even pak atan has hair on his head! through mukshin the movie, we come full circle with the characters, and the world that yasmin has introduced us to. we come to learn of and understand the family a little bit more, set in the days when they\\'re still living in their kampung (revisited back in rabun), where orked attends a chinese school, and packs some serious combination of punches (and you wonder about that burst of energy in gubra, well, she had it in her since young!). the perennial tomboy and doted child of the family, she prefers playing with the boys in games, rather than mindless \"masak-masak\" with the girls, and favourite outings include going with the family to football matches. the arrival of a boy called mukhsin (mohd syafie naswip) to the village provides a cool peer for orked to hang out and do stuff with - cycling through the villages, climbing trees, flying kites. and as what is desired to be explored, the crossing of that line between friendship and romance, both beautiful emotions. mukhsin does have its cheeky moments which liven up the story, and bring about laughter, because some of the incidents, we would have experienced it ourselves, and sometimes serve as a throwback to our own recollection of childhood. in short, those scenes screamed \"fun\"! we observe the life in a typical kampung, where some neighbours are very nice, while others, the nosy parkers and rumour mongers, spreading ill gossip stemming from envy. there are 2 additional family dynamics seen, one from an immediate neighbour, and the other from mukhsin\\'s own, both of which serve as adequate subplots, and contrast to orked\\'s own. as always, yasmin\\'s movies are filled with excellent music, and for mukhsin, it has something special, the song \"hujan\" as penned by her father, as well as \"ne me quitte pas\", aptly used in the movie given that the yasmin\\'s movies to date have been centred around the same characters, the beauty of it is that you can watch them as stand alone, or when watched and pieced together, makes a compelling family drama dealing with separate themes and universal issues like interracial romance, love, and forgiveness. fans will definitely see the many links in mukhsin back to the earlier movies, while new audiences will surely be curious to find out certain whys and significance of recurring characters or events, like that pudgy boy who steals glances at orked. and speaking of whys, parts of mukhsin too is curiously open, which probably is distinctive of yasmin\\'s style, or deliberately left as such. i thought that as a story about childhood, recollected from memory, then there are details which will be left out for sure. and subtly, i felt that mukhsin exhibited this perfectly, with not so detailed details, and the focus on what can be remembered in significant episodes between the two. another highly recommended movie, and a rare one that i feel is suitable for all ages - bring along your kid brother or sister! the film is partly a thriller and partly a public-service announcement when seeing the events through the perspectives of politicians, terrorists and of course victims. in this smart drama lessons are given about contamination and surviving chaos while meantime the backstage look at the way crisis is managed prompts viewers to distrust guardians and to be scared by assailants. the film, originally aired on bbc, gets to arouse effectively doubts on official prepareparedness. performances are proper, understated though never terrific. the flick is just a beginning, a provocative start leading to a larger discussion but it gets to work in my opinion, giving the right thrills and causing the audience to reason and to ask itself questions. this could have been great. the voice-overs are exactly right and fit the characters to a t. one small problem though; the look of the characters, mostly the supporting or guest characters look exactly the same. the same bored look on every face only with minor changes such as hairlines or weight size. it looks kind of odd to see a really big guest star\\'s voice coming out of a lifeless form like the characters here. if i am not mistaken kathy griffin did a voice-over for this show and it looked too odd to be funny. there is a few other problems, one being the family plot. the simpsons did it much better where you could actually buy most of the situations the characters got themselves into. here we get too much annoying diversions, like someone having a weird fantasy and then we are supposed to find that funny but for some reason the delivery is a bit off. as you can probably tell it is hard for me to put a finger on exactly what is wrong with this show because it basically nothing more than a clone of the simpsons or even more \"married with children\". if i should point a finger on what is totally wrong with this it probably is it\\'s repetitiveness. peter griffin is not really a bright character but neither are any of the others. lois should have been named lois lame because she is sort of one-dimensional. seth green as the kind of retarded son is the best thing about this show and that is the most stereotypical part on the show. so what more can i say. there isn\\'t exactly anything wrong with this show but in the long run you have to admit that it takes a lot of work to do what the simpsons has done for almost two decades. a good documentary reviewing the background behind our societies oil addiction, the problem concerning our present energy usage and finally discusses the effects of the coming energy deficit originating from the peak oil production problem. this movie should be educated to all students as part of their education. show it to your children, parents, relatives and friends. they will thank you eventually. after reviewing the contents of this documentary and comparing its mentioned sources i would say that the facts in this movie are well scientifically supported. not the best plot in the world, but the comedy in this movie rules. kelsey grammar is wonderful in this movie. another funny guy is rob schneider who will make you crack up with his segments with ken hudson campbell who plays buckman. lauren holly plays probably the more serious character in the cast as lt. lake. bruce dern is a great actor in this movie, playing probably the most serious character in the movie. the actor i liked the most was toby huss as nitro, all the electric shots his character takes in the movie is hilarious. plot is a little uneven, about lt. commander tom dodge, who for years has wanted to command his own sub. when he finally gets the chance, instead of a brand new sub, he gets a rusty wwii diesel sub, the stingray. his crew isn\\'t any better, misfits of the u.s. navy. he is then put in a series of war games, that shows how an old diesel engine can handle itself against the current nuclear navy. things still don\\'t get any better when he finds out his dive officer is actually a female officer, to see how women do on actual subs. to get the commander position he wants, he has to win the war games, and blow up a dummy ship. the movie fairs quite well, in fact i laughed non-stop when i saw this movie in theaters. i loved when they were in silence and buckman farts, and everyones reaction to the smell is hilarious. overall, 9 out of 10, this movie is just plain fun to watch, it nice to have a movie like this, i hate movies that try to be 100% serious. what a surprise; two outstanding performances by the lead actresses in this film. this is the best work busy phillips has ever done and the best from erika christensen since traffic. this film certainly should be in oscar contention. see this movie! felt it was very balanced in showing what jehovahs witnesses have done in protecting american freedoms. it also showed the strong faith of two families who were first generation witnesses. i also appreciated how it showed how by becoming a jehovahs witness affects non-witness family members and how hard it is for them to accept the fact that they don\\'t celebrate holidays, the sad part is that non-witness families do not think of having their witness family over for family dinners/visits or give them gifts at any other times but for holidays or birthdays. when it comes to medical care the witnesses want and expect a high standard of medical care, what people forget is that blood transfusions allow for sloppy medical care and surgeries whereas bloodless treatments causes the medical team to be highly skilled and trained, which would you prefer to treat your loved ones? i highly recommend this video! a proof that it\\'s not necessary for a movie to have a deep many-layered story and other sophisticated elements to be a good movie. even if the story could be expanded in many directions, especially in more sociological way (people lust for money) it seems that it\\'s perfect just the way it is. through many sudden changes it takes the spectator to the end without any unnecessary complications and without letting the spectator taking the eyes of the screen. but the acting for me isn\\'t so good. with the exception of lindsey mckeon the others were average or even worst. in some scenes they just empty-stared in front of themselves. for exception of lindsey which was more convincing. it\\'s a really simple movie for just laying back and enjoying. 7/10 i also saw this at the cinema in the 80s and have never forgotten it, even though i have never seen it again anywhere. i don\\'t know whether if i did see it now it would seem dated, but remembering the storyline and comparing it to some of the terrible modern films i\\'ve seen on zone horror i should think it would stand up very well. i can still remember his coffin sliding out and opening up and all the dead bodies becoming reanimated, and the blue lightning. having seen hundreds of horror movies and still remembering this one, it must be good. the film \"chaos\" takes its name from gleick\\'s 1988 pop science explanation of chaos theory. what does the book or anything related to the content of the book have to do with the plot of the movie \"chaos\"? nothing. the film makers seem to have skimmed the book (obviously without understanding a thing about it) looking for a \"theme\" to united the series of mundane action sequences that overlie the flimsy string of events that acts in place of a plot in the film. in this respect, the movie \"choas\" resembles the canadian effort \"cube,\" in which prime numbers function as a device to mystify the audience so that the ridiculousness of the plot will not be noticed: in \"cube\" a bunch of prime numbers are tossed in so that viewers will attribute their lack of understanding to lack of knowledge about primes: the same approach is taken in \"chaos\": disconnected extracts from gleick\\'s books are thrown in make the doings of the bad guy in the film seem fiendishly clever. this, of course, is an insultingly condescending treatment of the audience, and any literate viewer of \"chaos\" who can stand to sit through the entire film will end up bewildered. how could a film so bad be made? rewritten as a novel, the story in \"chaos\" would probably not even make it past a literary agent\\'s secretary\\'s desk. how could (at least) hundreds of thousands (and probably millions) of dollars have been thrown away on what can only be considered a waste of time for everyone except those who took home money from the film? regarding what\\'s in the movie, every performance is phoned in. save for technical glitches, it would be astonishing if more than one take was used for any one scene. the story is uniformly senseless: the last time i saw a story to disconnected it was the production of a literal eight-year-old. among other massive shortcomings are the following: the bad guy leaves hints for the police to follow. he has no reason whatsoever for leaving such hints. police officers do not carry or use radios. dupes of the bad guy have no reason to act in concert with the bad guy. let me strongly recommend that no one watch this film. if there is any other movie you like (or even simply do not hate) watch that instead. i rented this movie with my friend for a good laugh. we actually got laughed at by the clerk at the video store because of our questionable movie tastes. unfortunately, i don\\'t remember the first half of the movie because all i did was stare at the giant metal braces jane wore. and i didn\\'t hear anything either due to the incomprehensible lisp. the other thing that was able to grasp my attention besides her metal mouth was her questionable fashion sense. this movie was made in 2005 but it seems like the wardrobe people jumped all the way back to 2000 for the clothes. if you remember the days when aaron carter was considered a \"popstar\" and you like high waisted jeans, ankle socks and knee length skirts, then this little trip down memory lane is perfect for you. silent historical drama based on the story of anne boleyn, newly arrived lady-in-waiting to the queen who catches the lustful eye of henry viii, bad-tempered king of england who loves to feast, drink, hunt, be entertained by his court jester, watch jousts, and chase around after young beauties who jump out of cakes and assorted attractive females around the castle. well, he\\'s soon annulled his marriage, married anne, and telling her it is her holy duty to produce a male heir. she fails on that score and he soon has his eye on yet another lady-in-waiting. meanwhile, anne spends pretty much the entire film looking hesitant, perturbed, or downright ready to burst into tears. she just doesn\\'t come across as a happy camper (or is it just bad acting?!). this film is a solid piece of entertainment, with an absorbing story that held my interest for two hours - plus i enjoyed seeing the very lavish medieval costuming featured here on a gorgeous sepia tinted print. emil jannings is quite striking and memorable in his well-done portrayal of king henry the eighth - he really seemed like he was henry the eighth. i am not so sure about the performance given by the actress who plays anne, seemed a bit over the top. the dvd of this film features an appropriate, nicely done piano score that perfectly suits this story. quite a good film. as a camera operator, i couldn\\'t help but admire the great look that this picture achieved. the performances were excellent, as was the story. just when i thought this film was about to slow down, it didn\\'t. heart-pounding tension, great pacing through editing, and a score that knows when to be quiet all come together here under competent and capable direction. the camera was always in the right place. love that. i just saw this movie at a sneak preview and all i can say is...\"what did i just watch????\" and i mean that in a good and bad way. the plot is really simple. stiller and black play friends/neighbors. stiller is the focused, hardworker while black is a dreamer. black invents this idea to create a spray that erases poo. the idea becomes very popular, and black becomes very rich. the extravagant lifestyle that black gains and the fact that he still tries to be best friends with stiller causes stiller to become crazy with envy. as i said, the plot is simple. everything else is plain odd. the direction is odd, with a weird rotating opening shot to out-of-nowhere sped up sequences. the dialouge and the acting is very odd; odd in a rambling sort of way. and the sound track is the oddest thing in the movie, from the weird \"envy\" song that keeps on reappearing to the scene where you think you\\'re going to hear a classic 80\\'s song but suddenly it\\'s in japanese. so, the true question is this...is odd funny? that depends purely on the individual. i was cracking up at the shear unwavering weirdness of the movie. after the screening i heard people call it horribly unfunny and glad that it was free. strangely, i understood their point. there are no jokes whatsoever, so if you aren\\'t hooked by the uniqueness of it all, you will hate this movie. absolutely hate it. this movie is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a dvd cult classic. if you can laugh at a movie with no real jokes, like cable guy or punch drunk love, then i suggest you see it. if you don\\'t, run away from this movie. it\\'ll only make you mad. duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner\\'s mansion in paris. when the evil butler hears that the rich old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cats first, the butler is angered, because he wants to get everything first. so he puts them to sleep and abandons them off the side of the road. when the cats wake up, they start on a long trek home. a street wise cat named thomas o\\'malley meets up with them and offers to help them. when edgar sees them arriving home, he is furious, and starts to mail them to timbucktu. but thomas\\' friends arrive to help save the day. the wealthy lady decides to leave her home for every alley cat in paris. this is a charming film. the songs, including \"everybody wants to be a cat\", are lively and upbeat. the voice cast is excellent, with eva gabor(who would later play miss bianca in disney\\'s the rescuers films) as duchess, phil harris(baloo in the jungle book, little john in robin hood) as thomas, giving interesting personalities to their characters. supposedly walt disney, before he died in 1966, gave the go-ahead to this film. recommended for disney fans or cat lovers everywhere! 10/10. slipknot is a hardcore rock band from des moines, iowa. nine band members who all wear customized boilersuits, and personalized, homemade masks (eg. #6\\'s clown mask, #0\\'s various gasmasks, #8\\'s tattered + torn crashtest dummie mask with dreadlocks). the music itself seems to walk the finelines between sane and otherwise, yet is performed so brilliantly and psychotic. \"welcome to our neighborhood\" sounds rather a generic title, but the footage itself is something else. interviews with the band, soundbites from their latest, selftitled album, 2 live performances, and one banned-by-mtv music video (a brilliant homage to the classic kubrick film \"the shining\"), the movie clocks in at not even half-an-hour, but is certainly worth it. it is perfect for introducing any metal/hardcore fan to slipknot. the review on the main page admits that the movie is horrible but that you should forgive it because it is nicely violent. no you shouldn\\'t. there are spoilers at the end of this review but how i can \"spoil\" this rotten movie i have no idea. even if you are a die hard alien/pred fan like i am wait for the dvd. it isn\\'t worth a 3.99 rental either but you\\'ll be much less inclined to truly hate this film if you pay that than 12 bucks or better per person plus concession purchases at a theater. in the theater i watched avpr there were exactly two laughs, both by a girl sitting next to me. other than that there was total silence throughout. no ooohs, or \"that was bad ass!\", nothing. imagine being a patient on an operating table and just being given the anesthetic. now you know what you\\'ll feel like in the theater after the opening scene of avpr. what was the budget on this movie? like war of the worlds, mi 3, and other f/x driven movies the director seems far more involved in what the cgi people can come up with than developing characters or a plot. spielberg has tried and failed at this several times, usually with tom cruise. sure the movies make money but should they? war of the worlds and minority report had the budget to pay for a decent script, tom cruise et al, and ss himself but were still awful. i\\'m sure avp wasted 90% of their budget on cg and had no choice but to hire any actor that would say yes even though the casting agent would have done better by going to the supermarket and picking actors at random. there is no tension developed in any scene so we are never close to being surprised. who cares who gets killed? we didn\\'t know any of them, we all know what happens when the lil aliens make their corporeal exit, we all know the blood is acid. in alien, aliens, 3, resurrection, and even avp the directors make use of the fact that the aliens can think, can hide and can lay traps. this director decided that the ridley scott, james cameron, and others were idiots for developing characters you actually want to see either live or get killed. in this installment you will never care who lives or dies, not a kid, a parent, a pregnant woman. the characters serve only one purpose in this movie, to die. the opening scenes establish the fact that the movie is going to be a predictable joke. the character development scenes mix clichã©s, bad humor, and bad acting and numb the viewer to the point where we really don\\'t care if they get killed so long as they die in never before seen ways. but they don\\'t. the director tried to make something different from those who preceded him in the alien franchise but only succeeded in discarding the good parts of the first films, the human protagonists, and stealing the rest from other recent sci-fi films. there is not one original use of the either the alien or pred characters. the pred actually has little trouble killing aliens by the dozen even though the last movie led us to believe that pred revered the aliens as such a deadly foe that they used the killing of one as rite of passage. the alienpred is never really developed as a fearsome creature. its ability to inject parasites into a host is ripped from several different movies most recently probably was hellboy where samiel\\'s dismembered tongue injected eggs into hellboy or doom where the mutated creatures would leave their tongues behind after they speared a victim\\'s throat. simply put we aren\\'t given reason to care about anything in this movie. there is violence but it doesn\\'t shock or surprise and is nothing that hasn\\'t been seen in any of a hundred slasher flicks. the cg is ok and both species of alien are made to look and move as they have in movies past. but since the characters are never developed and the acting is so bad we kind of hope that they all die. the little girl was probably the best actor of the bunch but sadly we aren\\'t made to care whether or not kids, women, or anyone else lives or dies. we just want the movie to end. eventually it does but not before another stolen plot line from resident evil 2 has a nuke aim gunnison\\'s way to wipe out the \"infection\". and not before yet another stupid scene that is supposed to open the door for further sequels but does it? in a movie filled with bad scenes the worst may have been saved for last. sorry for the repetition but everything bears repeating: bad script, no plot, unoriginal action scenes, uninspired direction, abysmal acting, decent f/x that were wasted because of the many flaws. i don\\'t mind going to an indie film and being disappointed. the actors and directors and crew are probably getting their careers going and working on a shoestring budget. for a movie with this type of budget and hype i feel cheated along with disappointed. this movie is a painfully boring waste of time from the opening scene to closing credits. sad to say that a preview of hellboy 2 was the best part of avpr and hb2 didn\\'t even look that good. the movie plot seems to have been constructed from a disjointed dream. there is not enough realism to hold the viewer\\'s interest. the vermont farm scene was a failed opportunity to show the way farms were set up and farm families lived which would have been interesting and entertaining. there was little if no research into the whiskey bootlegging trade of the period. the costumes of the canadians looked like something from the french revolution, totally unbelievable. the fiddle playing was good and of the time period but chris\\'s motions while supposedly playing were unbelievable. the owl\\'s appearance was a never explained mystery and the train disappearing into thin air was too much. i couldn\\'t understand how a live trout got frozen into the ice and why two men in the wilderness without food would release the trout, a good food source. it\\'s 2005, my friends...a time of amazing special effects and an age of technology. so, why can\\'t we see a movie that\\'s a little more thought out than this cheesy low-budget film. i\\'ve seen a lot of low-budget movies that rock my socks off, but this one...it\\'s almost as if it\\'s trying to be horrible. just...don\\'t...watch it. i can look past lack of special effects and computer generated scenes if the acting itself was at least good. i feel like a small child produced this entire movie. there\\'s not even an original plot line. vampire assassins, in itself is one big plot hole with an attempt to mock itself. can someone tell me if, perhaps, this was designed as a comedy movie and i just didn\\'t know it? it makes me wonder, what does the sequel have in store for us who so loved the first installment? even with a cast that boasts such generally reliable names as val kilmer and lisa kudrow, wonderland fails to yield any sense of depth to this film. it barely brushes the surface of the incidents that happened on that july night in 1981. kilmer just goes through the motions as john holmes and kudrow and kate bosworth are both hopefully miscast in the other two lead roles; as holmes\\'s wife and underage girlfriend, respectively. the rest of the cast has such small roles that it\\'s impossible to get any dimensions from them. the film also stars carrie fisher, ted levine, franky g, mc gainey, dylan mcdermott and a cameo from paris hilton. in the colonies we\\'re not all that familiar with arthur askey, so i nearly skipped this film (which had its tcm preview recently) on account of the negative comments here on his appearance in \"ghost train\" -- which i expected to be thoroughly annoying. instead i was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly. the physical aspects of askey\\'s comedy and his timing when delivering a line suggest what you\\'d get if charlie chaplin and woody allen had a baby. there is no comparing him to bud abbott or any of the other usual purveyors of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre. one can feel, moreover, the thread connecting askey to british comedy 30 years later; at least it is clear from an american point of view that he has more in common with the monty python troupe than with any of his counterparts over here. as for the rest of the film -- the more movies you\\'ve seen, the more likely you\\'ll guess at the ending, but it is still quite entertaining and atmospheric and worth waiting for its next appearance. probably new zealands worst movie ever made the jokes they are not funny. used from other movies & just plain corny the acting is bad even though there is a great cast the story is uninteresting & boring has more cheese then pizza huts cheese lovers pizza kind of like the acting has been do 1,000 times before i watched this when it came on tv but was so boring could only stand 30 minutes of it. this movie sucks do not watch it, watch paint dry instead like the other comments says, this might be surprise to those who haven\\'t seen the work of jeunet & caro or emir kusturica. but have you already seen delicatessen, there is nothing new it this film. i thought delicatessen was great when it came out, but this film just arrive too late to be of any interest. i don\\'t think it\\'s a worse film than delicatessen but it\\'s a bore to see it now, like it probably would be to watch delicatessen again. there is really no point to the film, nothing that really matter or stays with you. there may be a distant similarity to the films of kusturica, but he\\'s really in a different league, so you should rather go see his films than waste your time on tuvalu. to put it simply, the fan was a disappointment. it felt like as if i was watching taxi driver, except taxi driver was much better than this. it seemed like the filmmakers wanted us to root for robert deniro\\'s character 100 percent. this approach didn\\'t work. the opening scene keeps me from rating at absolute zero. i wish the entire movie was as gritty and real as the intro. in order to enjoy some movies, a lot can be forgiven,(hand guns with 60 shots, hero\\'s with super human powers, all women are gorgeous and half naked) but puuuuleeese this \"assault on my intelligence 13\" is so far fetched that i\\'m surprised the cast showed up for a second day of filming. firstly, how did these guys get to be cops? based on stupidity i guess. how do the main female characters justify being half naked in the middle of winter in detroit or wherever the heck they are. as a matter of fact no character reacts to the elements whatsoever in this movie. no windows, no electricity(which miraculously returns unexplained)during the storm of the century and they are all comfy as bugs in a rug. what technology exists which disables all cell phones, radios, and brain function. this must be the same power which causes maria bella to walk from her disabled car knee deep in snow with no coat and hardly any dress. in this day and age in which just about every other news story involves discussions of waterboarding, images of abu ghraib, or tales of forced detentions at guantanamo bay, gavin hood\\'s \"rendition\" is about as up-to-the-minute and timely a movie as is ever likely to come out of the entertainment mills of mainstream hollywood. it\\'s not, by any stretch of the imagination, a perfect film, but neither does it merit the caterwauling opprobrium it has received at the hands of critics from all across the ideological and political spectrum. the term \"rendition\" refers to the ability of the cia to arrest any individuals it suspects of terrorist dealings, then to whisk them away in secret to a foreign country to interrogate and torture them for an indefinite period of time, all without due process of law. anwar el-ibrahimi is an egyptian man who has been living for twenty years in the united states. he has an american wife, a young son and a new baby on the way. he seems a very unlikely candidate for a terrorist, yet one day, without warning or explanation, anwar is seized and taken to an undisclosed location where he is subjected to brutal torture until he admits his involvement with a terrorist organization that anwar claims to know nothing about. on the negative side, \"rendition\" falters occasionally in its storytelling abilities, often biting off a little more than it can chew in terms of both plot and character. the ostensible focal point is douglas freeman, a rookie cia agent who is brought in to observe anwar\\'s \"interrogation\" at the hands of egyptian officials. the problem is that, as conceived by writer kelley sane and enacted by jake gyllenhaal, freeman seems too much of a naã¯ve \"boy scout\" to make for a very plausible agent, and he isn\\'t given the screen time he needs to develop fully as a character. we know little about him at the beginning and even less, it seems, at the end. he \"goes through the motions,\" but we learn precious little about the man within. thus, without a strong center of gravity to hold it all together, the film occasionally feels as if it is coming apart at the seams, with story elements flying off in all directions. a similar problem occurs with anwar\\'s distraught wife, played by reese witherspoon, a woman we never get to know much about apart from what we can see on the surface. gyllenhaal and witherspoon have both proved themselves to be fine actors under other circumstances, but here they are hemmed in by a restrictive screenplay that rarely lets them go beyond a single recurring note in their performances. what makes \"rendition\" an ultimately powerful film, however, is the extreme seriousness of the subject matter and the way in which two concurrently running plot lines elegantly dovetail into one another in the movie\\'s closing stretches. it may make for a slightly more contrived story than perhaps we might have liked on this subject, but, hey, this is hollywood after all, and the film has to pay some deference to mass audience expectations if it is to get itself green lighted, let alone see the light of day as a completed project. two of the supporting performances are particularly compelling in the film: omar metwally who makes palpable the terror of a man caught in a real life kafkaesque nightmare from which he cannot awaken, and yigal naor who makes a surprisingly complex character out of the chief interrogator/torturer. meryl streep, alan arkin and peter sarsgaard also make their marks in smaller roles. special mention should also be made of the warm and richly hued cinematography of dion beebe. does the movie oversimplify the issues? probably. does it stack the deck in favor of the torture victim and against the evil government forces? most definitely. (one wonders how the movie would have played if anwar really were a terrorist). yet, the movie has the guts to tread on controversial ground. it isn\\'t afraid to raise dicey questions or risk the disapproval of some for the political stances it takes. it openly ponders the issue of just how does a nation hold fast to its hard-won principle of \"civil liberties for all\" in the face of terrorism and fear. and just how much courage does it take for people of good will to finally stand up and say \"enough is enough,\" even at the risk of being branded terrorist-appeasing and unpatriotic by those in power? (the movie also does not, in any way, deny the reality of extreme islamic terrorism). thus, to reject \"rendition\" out of hand would be to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. \"rendition\" may not be perfect, but it is good, and it has something of importance to say about the world in which we now live. and that alone makes it very much worth seeing. i\\'ve never laughed and giggled so much in my life! the first half kept me in stitches; the last half made me come completely unglued! i think i giggled for 15 minutes after the tape was over. his timing and delivery for his stories is almost unequaled. and though he talks fast, you catch every joke. which is probably why my \"laugh center\" was so overwhelmed; it took an extra 15 minutes to laugh at everything. the storyplot was okay by itself, but the film felt very bubbly and fake. it also had the worst ending. they were probably going for a surprise ending, but all it did was leave me the question of what the whole point of the story was. all other teen movies are better than this one. my comment is mainly a comment on the first commentator (the extra on the film) and his unhappy assessment of the film. i think his perspective indicates why an extra is an extra and a director is a director. the film was sweet, the acting sufficient, the experience of watching it a nice diversion from a busy work week. it wasn\\'t \"the hours\" (acting), or \"the matrix\" (special effects), or even \"the color purple\" (direction). most movies won\\'t be. but it also wasn\\'t the crap fest that \"vinny...\" would lead you to believe. sorry guy, just my 2 cents. as to the movie itself, it was in the end very gay affirming (+ #1). it showed a world full of diverse and less than perfect people--you know, just like ours (+ #2)! it opened a door on one culture without excluding other cultures (+ #3). and i liked the music (+ #4). the dvd version released by crash cinema was very poorly done. the mastering engineer must have been either drunk, asleep or not even in the room while it was being done. it looks like it was mastered from about a tenth generation copy and about halfway through the film, the audio synchronization disappears. the dialog is about 10 or 15 seconds behind the audio. if you\\'re thinking about purchasing this dvd, please save your money. i remember seeing this film at the theater back in 1973. also, the vhs copy of this film under the title of \"when taekwondo strikes\" looks better than the dvd, but the remaining several minutes of the movie are \"missing\". where is the original camera negative? ahh, nuthin\\' like cheesy, explopitative, semi-porn, masquerading as horror...this one stars jaqueline lovell(sometimes sara st. james), the nubile starlet also seen in \"femalien\", \"the erotic house of wax\", and that family favorite \"nude bowling party\". she is now a fixture in surrender cinema\\'s line-up of talentless cuties starring in pointless, soft-porn exploitation flicks. \"head of the family\" actually tries to be a real moovie. a con-man and a tramp try to get said-tramp\\'s husband off-ed. they turn to a large-brained evil genius in a wheelchair, and his family of moronic misfits, who uses mind control to send out zombies to do his nefarious bidding. said-genius has a giant head, hence the clever title of the film: that\\'s about the extent of the film\\'s humor. but basically, it\\'s an excuse to show off the ample talents of lovell and dianne colazzo (ernestina). laced with some of the wierdest dialogue can be herd (what the heck is \"plowing oats\", anycow??), and just plain stupid, this titular thriller will moost likey appeal to the breast-cownters of drive-in theater, but no one else. the moocow says avoid the devoid, unless yer looking for a rent on cheesy t&a/horror night. :=8p i happen to love this show. its a refreshing take on some older sci-fi feels and styles. they aren\\'t afraid to shoot, and when they do people tend to die. far too many show\\'s are afraid of this and end up just pointing the guns and then having it be a standoff. farscape also comes complete with a large amount of heartwarming characters. they all grow on you till the point where it confuses you to hear them discuss taking some of the animatronic ones out of their box\\'s to make the mini-series. from beginning to end farscape leaves you with a feeling of hope, and dispair, as new and unexpected things happen and then people live and die, surprising you every time. worth a watch even if you don\\'t have the time. wow, i\\'m a huge henry viii/tudor era fan and, well, this was .... interesting. the only one i watched was the catherine of aragon one. and wow...just wow. i\\'ve seen bad acting before, but this reached new heights. when the actress who played catherine was umm.. crying? she wails and screams and i have to admit i rewinded many times... many, many times .... funny, funny stuff. the only person who even showed any slight sliver of talent was the actress playing anne boleyn (i might be prejudiced though, i do have a slight obsession with anne boleyn, she was a really facinating woman, read up on her, it\\'s worth it!) also, i have read a lot about the tudor time period and i think that the characters weren\\'t very acurately displayed, they were all very stereotypical. only see this movie if you are prepared to see a very important time period, and the important lives of those involved turned into a laughing stock. it is hard to believe that anyone could take such a great book and and make such a terrible movie. imagine king kong being recast as an organ grinder\\'s monkey and fay wray\\'s part being played by a young boy. how about elton john as rambo!!!!.this movie is even worse than the tv remake of the night of the hunter. by using the title watchers and dean koontz\\'s name the makers of this movie should be sued for fraud by readers of the book who expected a reasonably accurate adaptation of the book. read the book, i have never talked to anyone who didn\\'t like it. another good book is the winner by david baldachi. must have to agree with the other reviewer. this has got to be the worst movie, let alone western i have ever seen. terrible acting, dialogue that was unimaginative and pathetic (let alone completely inappropriate for supposedly being in the 1800s), and oh, did i mention a battery pack prominently displayed on the back of one of the characters? i was waiting for the boom mike to fall in the middle of a scene. and the ending? the least i can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the movie...completely awful. and yes, it did contain every clichã© in the book from the slow walk down the empty dusty road to the laughable \"let\\'s remember when\" shots when a main character dies. luckily i saw this on free tv. don\\'t waste your time. in kpax softley brushes on the subtleties of eastern religious mores from the small archetypes embedded all over the film to the actual purpose of prot. spacey (prot) assumes a predominantly didactic role throughout the entire film - it is as if the statements he makes embody general truths about a culture of peace which is strongly promulgated in buddhism and hinduism. it can be said that prot is the eye of the storm - the world is in disarray and is \\'bright\\' and the false veil of reality is what everyone else sees, but prot sees truth - he sees the minute - and appreciates it and at some points fears it as he transcends his social construction of reality and becomes more humanly. the film is particularly detailed, therefore i would recommend that you watch it at least twice to see how softley interjects nuances. listen carefully to the narratives at the beginning and end as they truly touch on concepts not commonly presented in western philosophies. 9 of out 10 rating - superb - with nominal room for improvement. after 15 minutes watching the movie i was asking myself what to do: leave the theater, sleep or try to keep watching the movie to see if there was anything worth. i finally watched the movie: what a waste of time. maybe i am not a 5 years old kid anymore! i thought rachel york was fantastic as \"lucy.\" i have seen her in \"kiss me, kate\" and \"victor/victoria,\" as well, and in each of these performances she has developed very different, and very real, characterizations. she is a chameleon who can play (and sing) anything! i am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding rachel\\'s performance in \"lucy.\" even some bonafide tv and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal. so many people have focused on the fact that rachel doesn\\'t really look like lucy. my response to that is, \"so what?\" i wasn\\'t looking for a superficial impersonation of lucy. i wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown. and rachel certainly gave us that, in great depth. i also didn\\'t want to see someone simply \"doing\" classic lucy routines. therefore i was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have rachel portray lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits - vitameatavegamin and the candy factory. (it seems that some of the reviewers didn\\'t realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits). this approach, i thought, gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart. i also thought rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes. and she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated - the professor and the grape stomping, in particular. there was one moment in the grape scene where the corner of rachel\\'s mouth had the exact little upturn that i remember lucy having. i couldn\\'t believe she was able to capture that - and so naturally. i wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the lucille ball of \"i love lucy\" throughout the entire movie. after all, those of us who came to know her only through tv would not have any idea what lucy was really like in her early movie years. i think rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant. she planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge, given the right set of circumstances. lucy didn\\'t fit the mold of the old studio system. in her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era, she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate gifts. i believe that rachel deftly captured the comedy, drama, wit, sadness, anger, passion, love, ambition, loyalty, sexiness, self absorption, childishness, and stoicism all rolled into one complex american icon. and she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing. \"lucy\" was a star turn for rachel york. i hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future. i also hope it brings her an emmy. i have to say the first i watched this film was about 6 years ago, and i actually enjoyed it then. i bought the dvd recently, and upon a second viewing i wondered why i liked it. the acting was awful, and as usual we have the stereo-typical clansmen in their fake costumes. the acting was awful at best. tim roth did an ok job as did liam neeson, but i\\'ve no idea what jessica lange was thinking. the plot line was good, but the execution was just poor. i\\'m tired of seeing scotland portrayed like this in the films. braveheart was even worse though, which is this films only saving grace. but seriously, people didn\\'t speak like that in those days, why do all the actors have to have glaswegian accents? just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes. i notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the americans, and to be honest i can see why they\\'d like it, i know they have an infatuation for men in kilts. however, if you are thinking of buying the dvd, i\\'d say spend your money on something else, like a better film. i want cã©line and jessie go further in their relationship, i want to tell them that they were made for each other, that in a lot of moment in the film we want they to die for each other. their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached. this is about love but not stupid things like in \"notting hills\" or those kind of movie. this is life and i did believe in them, i did believe they were falling... this was so clever and touching. i have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there... i want to go to vienna. i want to see them as soon as possible again. i have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake, a concept, but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere, somehow and some when, something could really happen. i\\'m french and didn\\'t know very well july delpy despite kieslowski \"three colors : white\"... now i have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect acting. i saw \"before sunset\" (the sequel in paris) a few days before i saw \"before sunrise\" and their is no matter. they are both masterpieces. proof that you don\\'t need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings. i\\'m sorry for my english which i m trying to best. franck in france lovely candace bergen as the widow perdicaris are kidnapped and held for ransom by the sheik raisuli played by one dashing sean connery. the incident comes during 1904 as theodore roosevelt runs for election to the presidency in his own right. needing a good example to show off the muscular foreign policy of the united states, brian keith as roosevelt issues a stunning declaration to the sultan of morocco, \"perdicaris alive or raisuli dead.\" but in this adaptation of that incident the famous declaration is the only true thing about this story. the perdicaris in question was in reality one ion perdicaris who was a greek immigrant and dilettante playboy. in fact perdicaris gave up his american citizenship years ago and was back as a greek national. never mind that though, his predicament was serviceable enough at the time. the damsel in distress makes better screen material though so it\\'s a widow woman and her two kids that are in harm\\'s way here. of course as presented here the incident is also used by some of our european powers to get their foothold into morocco. the intrigues get far beyond one brigand\\'s demand for ransom. the wind and the lion is hardly history. but it is an enjoyable film and sean connery is always fun to watch. brian keith also fits my conception of theodore roosevelt and the scenes in the roosevelt white house do ring true to all the stories told. john huston plays the ever patient secretary of state john hay who roosevelt had inherited from his predecessor william mckinley. but kids don\\'t use this film to skip reading a history assignment on the theodore roosevelt era. this movie is pathetic in every way possible. bad acting, horrible script (was there one?), terrible editing, lousy cinematography, cheap humor. just plain horrible. i had seen \\'the wishmaster\\' a couple weeks before this movie and i thought it was a dead-ringer for worst movie of the year. then, i saw \\'the pest\\' and suddenly \\'the wishmaster\\' didn\\'t seem so bad at all. bad bad bad. excruciatingly bad. ...or better yet, watch fandango if you want to see a really intelligent and funny male college age road flick. rolling kansas sounded promising (in fact the program guide gave it 2.5 out of 4 stars which usually means it\\'s fairly watchable) but i pretty much fast-forwarded through it. usually road trip movies have great music, but i can\\'t even recall whether there was music. the only high point was a small role with rip torn as a wise old hitchhiker/guru. otherwise the jokes and timing missed all along the way. the four main characters are unknown actors and i don\\'t remember seeing any of them in another movie. (oh, yeah, i see that thos. hayden church was in it, but he\\'s in everything, good, bad or indifferent). this movie is about as funny as watching someone else stoned when you\\'re not. sharky\\'s machine is easily one of burt reynolds best efforts. it also stands as one of the best contemporary crime dramas. erotic and violent, the movie distinguishes itself by setting the story in atlanta, and delivering a chaotic detective case, to you(the viewer), on a silver platter. dedicated and determined, sharky must stop the murder of dominoe, a lovely lady of the night, who\\'s clientel is anything but ordinary. before long, sharky\\'s crimefighting machine uncovers a conspiracy of the highest order, which threatens to corrupt the inner body of atlanta. as a resident of metro atlanta, i recall the excitement in town during the movie\\'s production. sharky\\'s machine goes to great lengths to give an accurate portrayal of atlanta. twenty years removed and 2,000,000-more people later, the film stands the test of time. trust me, atlanta has not changed. one of the highlights of the picture is dar robinson\\'s daring stunt(a classic, symbolic ending). it was even featured on that\\'s incredible, abc\\'s reality show of the period. it\\'s just too bad that hollywood does not make enough films like this one. kick back, each your popcorn, and watch sterling silver cinema action. winchester \\'73 is a great story, and that\\'s what i like about it. it\\'s not your everyday western--it uses a rifle, which passes hands from various characters--as a mechanism for telling the story about these people. rock hudson plays an indian chief, jimmy stewart plays a great leading man with heart and strength, and shelly winters plays a gal who has to cope with the realities of her husband and the wild west. it\\'s important to note for those politically correct types--they kill a lot of indians in this movie without remorse. by today\\'s standards, it\\'s still pretty violent. but it\\'s a great story and worth watching. enjoy! peak practice was a british drama series about a gp surgery in cardale â— a small fictional town in the derbyshire peak district â— and the doctors who worked there. it ran on itv from 1993 to 2002, and was one of their most successful series at the time. it originally starred kevin whately as dr jack kerruish, amanda burton as dr beth glover, and simon shepherd as dr will preston, though the roster of doctors would change many times over the course of the series. the series was axed in 2002 and ended on a literal cliffhanger when two of the series main characters plunged off a cliff. viewers wrote to itv in their thousands and a petition for one last episode was set up by website peak practice online. however, all pleas were unsuccessful and itv said they would not make any more episodes. peak practice was replaced by sweet medicine, another medical series set in derbyshire. it lasted a few episodes before it was dropped from the schedules. cardale was based on the derbyshire village of crich, and the series was filmed there and at other nearby derbyshire towns and villages, most notably matlock and ashover. after the end of this programme, itv attempted to launch a follow-up series called sweet medicine, which extended the stories of different characters from the original show. maria braun is an extraordinary woman presented fully and very credibly, despite being so obtuse as to border on implausibility. she will do everything to make her marriage work, including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation. and thus beneath the vicey exterior, she reveals a rather sweet value system. the film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending which afterwards feels wholly inadequate, with the convenience familiar from ending your school creative writing exercise with \\'and then i woke up\\'. it is also book-ended at the other end with the most eccentric title sequence i\\'ve ever seen, but don\\'t let any of that put you off. this quasi j-horror film followed a young woman as she returns to her childhood village on the island of shikoku to sell the family house and meet up with old friends. she finds that one, the daughter of the village priestess, drowned several years earlier. she and fumiko (another childhood friend) then learn that sayori\\'s mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic. already the bonds between the dead and living are getting weak and the friends and villagers are seeing ghosts. nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie. unlike stellar j-horror films, the suspense doesn\\'t really build, the result doesn\\'t seem overly threatening and the ending borders on the absurd. this movie is like plain white rice cooked a little too long so that it is bordering on mushy. sometimes you get this at poor asian restaurants or cook your own white rice a little too long. you end up eating it, because you need it with the meal, because what is chinese or japanese food without rice, but it almost ruins the meal because of the gluey, gooey tastelessness of it all. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies this dreadful film assembles every asian stereotype you can imagine into one hideous package. money grubbing, devious japanese business men send goofy but loveable policeman pat morita to recover industrial secrets in detroit. here he encounters a down at heel jay leno, who promptly refers to a murder victim as a jap and calls morita tojo. it\\'s all downhill from there. \"gypsy\" is possibly the greatest musical ever written, so it\\'s too bad that it\\'s film version was such a disappointment. to make up for that, we have this re-make which, if not flawless, is an enjoyable and well done adaption of the musical. the script is completely accurate, all the songs included, and the staging remains close to the original jerome robbins\\' staging. bette midler is a deft choice for rose, her singing and personality merman-esquire, and her acting splendid. peter reigert is a fine herby, if not a great singer, and cynthia gibb is a straight forward, natural louise. in truth, a live taping of the 1989 revival with tyne daly might have been a better idea, if only because \"gypsy\" is simply more exciting on stage, but this film is a fine translation of a great musical. unless you are mentally ill or the most die hard segal fan you will tire of this horrendous excuse for a film in under 5 minutes. the plot - even for a seagal film, the plot is just stupid. i mean its not just bad, its barely coherent. the acting - unbelievably wooden. literally seen better acting in porno\\'s. ironically this film tries to cash in on this audience which a \\'lesbian love scene\\' which is utterly cringe-worthy. special effects - wouldn\\'t look out of place in a 60\\'s sword and sorcery flick. unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other cures, don\\'t make the same mistake as i did and buy this dvd, as you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back. when i first saw it 9 years ago, when i was 9. i thought it stunk. i\\'m 18 now and i still think it stinks. i mean geez no special effects or anything, it was boring and kinda anti-climatic. my cousin watched once and george takai (sulu) kept talking about how it was supposed to be so much better, but they kept cutting to the budget. it would have been a great episode, but it was a terrible movie. saw a screener of this before last year\\'s award season, didn\\'t really know why they gave them out after the voting had ended, but whatever, maybe for exposure, at the least, but the movie was a convoluted mess. sure, some parts were funny in a black humor kind of way, but none of the characters felt very real to me at all. there was not one person that i could connect with, and i think that is where it failed for me. sure, the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive towards scientology, wow! what a grand idea...let\\'s see if that already hasn\\'t been mined to the point of futility. the whole ordeal feels fake, from the lighting, the casting, the screenplay to the horrible visual effects(which is supposed to be intentional, i can tell, and so can everyone else, no one is laughing with you though). anyways, i hope it makes it out for sale on dvd at least, i wouldn\\'t want a project that a lot of people obviously put a lot of effort into get completely unnoticed. but it\\'s tripe either way. boring tripe at that. read eric\\'s review again. he perfectly described my own feeling for this film so more eloquently than i ever could. i\\'m only writing here to further encourage you to look for and see it. i saw it many years ago on tv, the ifc i think. it is such a unique film i hesitate to make comparisons. it was filmed in northern mexico, somewhere in the relentless badlands of coahuila/zacatecas/san luis potosi. this isn\\'t the sedona-like durango,mexico (of the john wayne films) but a truly stark and wild place. i have to find the novel now to check on the original location of the story. like the location, this movie is strange and wild and wonderful and weird and absolutely not for everyone. it is the kind of production that almost motivates me to study film. i hadn\\'t actually forgotten this movie, it is indelible. yet, over the years, i had forgotten of its existence. i know nobody who has seen it, had never read of it, nor seen any reference to it. erendira is such an unusual name, i\\'d even forgotten the title. well, i\\'ll be looking to buy a copy now. **i have since the above posting become a huge fan of gabriel garcia marquez and so regret not having read him before. relative to msmyth\\'s comment below; the movie was filmed in mexico but the author is colombian and was not commenting on mexico or mexican history in any way, although marquez now lives in mexico for \"political\" reasons. this story is universal. i am still trying desperately to find a copy of this film for my library. liked the movie? you have to read the story and then everything else garcia marquz wrote. and, by the way, the original location in the story was colombia. this is an immoral and reprehensible piece of garbage, that no doubt wants to be a friday the 13th (1980) clone. the poster for this movie makes it look like there\\'s going to be some sort of a cross between jason and freddy, which is likely to attract movie-goers. there is nothing good or entertaining about this movie about this movie. it just makes me sad, just thinking that some people are going to stumble upon sleepaway camp ii: unhappy campers (1988) on video or dvd, and waste their time with this sad, cynical, depressing movie. angela baker (pamela springsteen) is a camp counselor at camp rolling hills, who hopes that the other campers are as nice as she is, and that they stay out of trouble. meanwhile, the other campers are realizing that people are disappearing one by one, with angela making up the excuse that she had to send them home. could angela be the killer, who was once a man, who underwent a sex change operation years earlier? who knows? who cares? the 1980s was home to a lot of movies that made the cross between the mad slasher and dead teenager genres, in which a mad killer goes berserk. some have a plot, some don\\'t, but they\\'re all about as bad as this one. sleepaway camp ii: unhappy campers is 80 minutes of teenagers being introduced and then being stabbed, strangled, impaled, chopped up, burned alive, and mutilated. that\\'s all this movie is. it is just mindless, bloody violence. watching this movie, i was reminded of the friday the 13th movies, in which the message for its viewers was that the primary function of teenagers is to be hacked to death. the filmmakers of sleepaway camp ii have every right to be ashamed of themselves. imagine the sick message that this movie offers for its teen viewers: \"the world is a totally evil place,\" this movie tells you, \" and it\\'ll kill you. it doesn\\'t matter what your dreams or your hopes are. it doesn\\'t matter if you have a new boyfriend, or a new girlfriend. it doesn\\'t matter what you think, what you do or what your plans for the future are. you can forget those plans, because you\\'re just going to wind up dead.\" and the sickest thing is--and by not giving too much away--the movie simply sets up room for a sequel. well, why not? they\\'ve probably and already taken the bucket to the cesspool by making three or four of these movies. i missed out on the original sleepaway camp (1983), and, after watching its first sequel, i will hopefully stay away from the other sequels, as well as the original. and for parents, if you know kids who actually like this movie, do not let them date your children. this is the worst movie that i have ever seen. at first i thought that it was going to be good because i\\'m interested in the bermuda triangle, but instead it was terrible. all it did was offer a bunch of lame explinations that didn\\'t make sense (if time moves differently there how come the woman didn\\'t age, and her son aged rapidly), and have a horrible sappy ending. next time the guys who made this go to bermuda they should take all copies of this movie with them. please everyone vote for this movie so it can get on the worst movie list. lame rip-off of the quatermass xperiment (1955): the first half is deadly dull, even dreary - but the latter stages improve considerably with the scenes involving the rampaging \\'monster\\'. in the accompanying featurette (a rather dry affair at a mere 9 minutes, when compared to the ones created for the other titles in criterion\\'s \"monsters & madmen\" set), director day - who admits to not being a fan of the sci-fi genre - tries to justify the film\\'s shortcomings by saying that he had a zero-budget to work with (where all the outer space scenes were composed of stock footage!)...and i\\'d have been inclined to be more lenient with the film had i not recently watched caltiki, the immortal monster (1959) - a similar (and similarly threadbare) but far more stylish venture from italy! bill edwards as the cocky but unlucky astronaut - obsessed with achieving the titular feat - is positively boring at first, but he eventually manages to garner audience sympathy when his physical features are deformed and the character develops a taste for blood! marshall thompson as his commanding officer and elder brother is o.k. as a leaner glenn ford type; he had previously starred in fiend without a face (1958), another (and more successful) richard gordon-produced sci-fi which, incidentally, is also available on dvd through criterion. italian starlet marla landi, struggling with the english language, makes for an inadequate female lead; even her input in the featurette proves to be of little lasting value! the audio commentary is yet another enjoyable tom weaver/richard gordon track where, among many things, the fact that first man into space was intended as a double-feature with corridors of blood (1958) is brought up - but it was eventually put out as a standalone release, so as to exploit the topical news value of the current space race; it\\'s also mentioned that the monster dialogue was actually dubbed by bonar colleano (who, tragically, died in a traffic accident prior to the film\\'s release!). weaver even recalls a couple of anecdotes from the time when he was involved in the production of the dvd featurette shot by, of all people, ex-cult-ish film-maker norman j. warren: landi, who by then had become a lady of title, was still ready to help out in carrying the equipment necessary to film the interview down several flights of stairs!; edwards was supposed to have contributed to the featurette but, once in london, he proved reluctant to co-operate with weaver - eventually, the latter learned that the actor had been recently diagnosed with cancer and, in fact, he died in 2002! (this has been edited for space) chan-wook park\\'s new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify. nominally a horror movie, the central character is a vampire, the film actually has elements of comedy, theology, melodrama, cultural invasion (and its analog of viral invasion of a body), romance and few other things as well. it\\'s a film that has almost too much on its mind. the film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic european literature, in this case emile zola\\'s \"thã©rã¨se raquin\". it\\'s an odd mix that doesn\\'t always gel, but none the less has an incredible power. here it is almost 24 hours since i saw the film at lincoln center (with a post film discussion by the director) and i find my cage is increasingly rattled. its not so much what happens is bothersome, its more that its wide reaching story and its themes ring a lot of bells in retrospect. the plot of the film has a will loved priest deciding that the best way to help mankind is to volunteer for a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease. infected with the disease he eventually succumbs and dies, but because of a transfusion of vampiric blood (its not explained) he actually survives. hailed as a miracle worker the priest returns to the hospital where he had been ministering to the sick. unfortunately all is not well. the priest finds that he needs blood to survive. he also finds that he has all of the typical problems of a vampire, and its no not possible for him to go out during the day. things become even more complicated when he becomes reacquainted with a childhood friend and his family. the priest, some of his animal passions awakened becomes taken with the wife of his friend. from there it all goes sideways. an ever changing film, this is a story that spins through a variety of genres as it tells the very human story of a man who finds that his life has been radically altered by a chance event and finds that he is no longer who he thought he was. it\\'s a film that you have to stay with to the end because the film is forever evolving into something else. its also a film that has a great deal on its mind and the themes its playing with are constantly being explored in a variety of ways the film has enough going on that one could, and people probably will, write books discussing the film. the two of the strongest parts of the film are its vampiric elements and its romance the vampire part of the tale is brilliant. there is something about how it lays out the ground rules and the nature of the \"affliction\" that makes such perfect sense that it kind of pushes the old vampire ideas aside. sitting in the theater last night i found myself amazed at how impressed how well it worked. i think the fact that it played more or less straight is what is so earth shaking. here is a vampire who just wants to have a normal life. it\\'s contrasted with what happens later, it makes clear that living an existence of hunting humans really isn\\'t going to work. its not the dark world of twilight or lost boys, rather its something else. i personally think that the film changes the playing field from a hip cool idea or dream into something more real and tangible. (the sequence where the powers kick in is just way cool) the romance is also wonderfully handled. sure the sex scenes are steamy and well done, but it\\'s the other stuff, the looks, the talk, the gestures outside of the sex that makes this special. i love the looks, the quiet stares as the forbidden couple look at each other hungering for each other and unable to act, the disappointment and heartbreak of betrayal both real and suspected, and the mad passion of possible consummation. this is one of the great screen romances of all time. it perfectly captures the feeling and emotion of deep passionate love (and lust). if you\\'ve ever loved deeply i\\'m guessing you\\'ll find some part of your hear on screen, i know i did. the statement \"i just wanted to spend eternity with you\" has a sad poignancy to it. it\\'s both a statement of what was the intention as well as the depth of emotion. the tragic romance will break your heart. i won\\'t lie to you and say that the film is perfect and great. its not, as good as the pieces are and almost all of them are great (especially the actors who i have unjustly failed to hail as amazing) the whole doesn\\'t always come together. the various genres, thematic elements and tones occasionally grate against each other. frequently i was wondering where the film was going. i hung in there even though the film seemed to be wandering about aimlessly. i liked the film a great deal. i loved the pieces more than the film as a whole. its been pinging around in my head since i saw it, and i\\'m guessing that it will do so for several days more. like or love is irrelevant since this is a film that really should be seen since it has so much going on that it will provide you with enough material to think and talk about for days afterward. one of the meatiest and most filling films of the year. the idea behind this movie was great. the story of a little girl facing abuse (both emotional and physical) and trying to deal with it and survive. what makes the movie fall apart is the terrible use of voice overs and the corny dialog. the actors have to point out the most obvious things over and over again. also, there is very tedious, almost funny, overuse of metaphors in the voice overs. the high point is the acting of the little girl. nice try, but this one\\'s a stinker. i watch them all. it\\'s not better than the amazing ones (_strictly ballroom_, _shall we dance?_ (japanese version), but it\\'s completely respectable and pleasingly different in parts. i am an english teacher and i find some of the ignorance about language in some of these reviews rather upsetting. for example: the \"name should scream don\\'t watch. \\'how she move.\\' since when can movie titles ignore grammar?\" there is nothing inherently incorrect about caribbean english grammar. it\\'s just not canadian standard english grammar. comments about the dialogue seem off to me. i put on the subtitles because i\\'m a canadian standard english speaker, so i just automatically assumed that i would have trouble understanding all of it. it wasn\\'t all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different flavour as the other step movies i have seen were so american. i loved that this movie was set in toronto and, in fact, wish it was even more clearly set there. i loved that the heroine was so atypically cast. i enjoyed the stepping routines. i liked the driven mum character. i felt that many of the issues in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance movies. in summary, if you tend to like dance movies, then this is a decent one. if you have superiority issues about the grammar of the english standard you grew up speaking, your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie. dear god! i kept waiting for this movie to \"get started\"... then i waited for it to redeem itself... and when it did neither, i just sat there, dumbfounded that: 1) it could possibly be this bad, and 2) that i had just wasted a couple of hours on just sheer stupidity. i had faith that drew couldn\\'t possibly have made this bad of a movie... and boy, did i ever lose my faith! don\\'t bother with this one! drew tried, but the movie was poorly written, poorly acted, and just poorly conceived! i can\\'t believe a script this bad ever got funded! it had a million chances to actually do something with the idea, (the word \"concept\" is too big for this movie to even qualify for!) and it still didn\\'t go anyplace! its just pitiful! where the other reviewer got the idea that it wasn\\'t the worst, baffles me! because believe me, if it got any worse i\\'d have slit my wrists before finishing it! first, let me start off by saying this film sounded very interesting: a serial killer copycatting the works of edgar allan poe (who is one of my writers of all time). sounds cool, right? yeah, definitely not. probably the worst film i\\'ve ever seen. ever. and that\\'s not an exaggeration. i\\'ve seen a lot of very, very bad movies. this one takes the cake. and i was even prepared for a bad movie before going into it. perhaps the writer should\\'ve studied some law enforcement procedure: if you have the name of the killer, his entire life\\'s history, a criminal record, and his address, where is the first place you should look? hmm. . . possibly. . . his house? what?! no! that\\'s a preposterous idea, anthony! how could you suggest something so obvious and level-headed rather than going to a bowling alley? *spoilers end* honestly, sometimes i can forgive a movie if the writing is good but the acting is bad, or vice versa. . . but this just had everything wrong with it you could possibly find. i think my biggest pet peeve was how the police/fbi acted. for example: black fbi agent: \"okay, endangered female, just sit here in this car in an empty parking lot while i go inside and look around the potential crime scene where a serial killer is supposed to be. sound good to you?\" moronic female fbi agent: \"yeah, sounds a-okay to me. go right ahead. i\\'ll be sure to not focus on my surroundings or at least check the perimeter.\" black fbi agent: \"excellent, that\\'s what i would do!\" honestly, if you want to be in law enforcement, rent this movie so you can learn how not to act. . . or if you\\'re a human and want to learn the same. 0.5/10: a half-point just for getting a film produced and in stores. congrats. -ap3- billy crystal co-wrote, co-produced and stars in this extremely safe and comfy comedy-drama about fathers and sons, adult irresponsibility, and growing old. billy plays a heart surgeon who has a heart attack (ha ha) which causes him to seek out his estranged father (alan king), a movie-extra who fancies himself a big star. the script is sub-neil simon nonsense with one-liners galore, a flat, inexpressive direction by henry winkler (stuck in sitcom mode), and family-conflict at the ready. crystal and king try their best, but king is over-eager and frequently over-the-top. jobeth williams has another one of her thankless roles, but manages to bring her innate, down-home class to the proverbial girlfriend character. it\\'s a comedy, i guess, but one that blinks back the tears...shamefully. ** from **** i went to see this on the strength of albert finney alone. he\\'s one of my favorite actors and he rarely fails to deliver. i\\'m not sure if the plot is interesting or just silly: it\\'s about a little boy who is about to be born, but as his mother goes into labor, he refuses to come out! this sends god and the whole human being factory into a crisis and albert finney is called out of purgatory to try and convince the boy to change his mind and decide to want to be born. so finney takes the unborn boy for an adventure in the big apple in hopes of showing him all the reasons he should want to live. despite the ridiculousness of the plot, i could have accepted it if the director had not tried to turn this into your typical hollywood sentimental moralistic message film. directorially, the film was rendered unbearable by a horrible soundtrack of the stock sentimental music that hollywood directors seem incapable of resisting. he further butchered the somewhat unconventional story by giving away its hand at every moment. whatever twists and turns were in store in the plot were completely given away by the way the story unraveled. it was as if the director assumed the audience is just a bunch of idiots who cannot see the obvious hints coming from a mile away. even finney in his performance, though satisfactory, seemed a bit awkward and out of place; and the little boy with curly locks, though he was supposed to be cute, was in fact rather dull. bridget fonda seemed intent on trying to duplicate demi moore\\'s performance in \\'ghost\\', shedding tears at a moment\\'s notice. i understand that the film has been unsuccessful thus far at getting distribution in the u.s., which surprises me as i think it has the box office potential to be a modest hit, appealing to both kids and sentimental adults. as far as the quality goes, it\\'s not an awful film, it\\'s just not very good. (4 out of 10) an astronaut gets lost in deep space and finds himself traveling through unknown territory on board of a living spaceship accompanied by a group of alien-outlaws. this incredible plotted and enjoyable tv-installment comes along as a positive birth-fantasy. the individual characters, in conflict at the beginning of the series, have to learn to get along with each other and evolve into a powerful group at last. most of the action takes place inside the womb of moia, the living space-ship (who even gets pregnant and gives birth to another ship!). while science-fiction-stories are usually interested in negative birth-fantasies (watch the \\'alien\\'-movies for example, especially the fourth part \\'resurrection\\') this comes as a surprise. also enjoyable is the absence of military hierarchy on board of the ship and the positive attitude towards sex and the human (and alien) body. one of the female characters who is actually a plant experiences \\'photogasms\\' while being exposed to sunlight. the crew even has to go to the toilet. wouldn\\'t that be impossible in \\'star trek\\'? this is a film that can make you want to see it again. i especially, liked the way it ended. i did not see the end coming, but when laws was not blown away the first time, one suspects he will be back again. the story is gripping and could have been more psychological, but i understand the story needed to capture the viewer and the action was necessary for that. hard to believe michael jr. could be so apparently unmoved as his younger brother and mother as blown away. but, i can appreciate the scene play couldn\\'t really take our attention there because it had a greater story to tell. some have complained about hanks as a gangster. i believe that isn\\'t justified. if his character had been any harder, he would not have cared if his son pulled a trigger or not. eight stars for this one. although it was released in 2002, i just saw it for the first time yesterday on dvd. i have been wanting to see this since my french teacher recommend it to me over forty years ago. perhaps the long wait was worth it, since the criterion collection dvd restoration is impressive. in its outline this movie follows the time-worn script: a quartet of men diligently plot a difficult heist of a bank vault, the heist takes place, a small seemingly insignificant event leads to the ultimate demise of all. even though the heist footage is transfixing, it occurs rather early and is ultimately not at the core of the film. this film separates itself from the typical heist movie by giving us insights into the personalities of the characters and their motivations - its plays as much as a drama as it does a thriller. relationships play a big role and a kidnapping is tacked on, giving us two movies for the price of one. john servais plays the idea man tony le stã©phanois (always referred to as \"le stã©phanois\") with such world-weariness that he could have just stepped out of a camus novel. tony has just recently gotten out of jail and resists re-entering the life of crime until he has a highly unpleasant interaction with his ex-lover (who has taken up with another man) where, as punishment, he physically whips her with a belt. thankfully that scene occurs off camera, but you are not likely to forget it. after that sobering event, since there seems little hope of reviving that relationship, tony meets with two of his old partners in crime, jo and mario, and decides to join them in one last big heist. they enlist the services of cesar, an italian safe cracker - played by director dassin himself - and we are off to the heist. the heist goes off without a hitch. but cesar\\'s womanizing bent is a personality trait that turns out to be fatal for all concerned. however, we can understand his attraction to the nightclub singer he has fallen for, since there is a brilliant set piece where she performs a sexy and cinematically inspired nightclub act - it has to be one of the most memorable scenes from any noir film. it is established early on that tony has a close relationship with jo and his family; in fact jo\\'s son refers to him as uncle. i think it is partly to help jo\\'s family that tony agrees to the heist. the ending scenes, where tony saves the life of jo\\'s kidnapped son, partially redeems his more brutal and amoral actions. but only partially. a cbs radio program entitled \"we the people\" assists in finding an american home for vienna refugee charles coburn (as karl braun), a skilled surgeon and pool hustler. he arrives with beautiful daughter sigrid gurie (as leni), who is \"studying\" to become a nurse. relocated to a small, dusty midwestern village, they are welcomed at the station by burly john wayne (as john phillips) and his uncle spencer charters (as \\'nunk\\' atterbury), a veterinarian. ms. gurie is unhappy in the dustbowl, and wants to leave. immediately. but, the prospect of romance with mr. wayne might change her mind... god answers the citizens\\' many prayers for rain, but it may not be enough to save the farming town. the entire town is advised to relocate to oregon. wayne wants to stay and tough it out. coburn receives an invitation to work at a top clinic. and, gurie learns her fiancã©, presumed dead, will be arriving to claim her as his wife. she feels duty-bound to accept; but, he has a dark secret... this film does not flatter wayne, who seems way out of his element. being paired with gurie, promoted as another garbo, doesn\\'t help. they do have a cute scene in wayne\\'s car (\"jalopy, an italian car\"). **** three faces west (7/3/40) bernard vorhaus ~ john wayne, sigrid gurie, charles coburn, spencer charters i have not read the book that this was based upon/inspired by. this being some of(the others are film roles) the last work of john ritter(rip), one hopes that it is hilarious. and it is. almost every time he\\'s present in this, as a matter of fact. most of the cast, supporting as well as regular, play off each other well, and the material tends to be great. he plays paul hennessy, the father of three teenagers: rory, the typical guy of that age, kerry, the depressive middle-child who fights for causes and awareness, and bridget, the fashion-loving, popular ditz. sagal makes a return to being the female lead in a sit-com, and her character is far removed from peggy bundy. the show changed somewhat after mr. three\\'s company passed on, and for a while, they couldn\\'t seem to make up their minds if they wanted to go for getting laughs, or being poignant and making sure to be respectful. one can wonder how or why it lasted for so long after that: it could still be quite good, some of the additions were fortunate(if you like david spade, most of his part consists of him doing his schtick) and had stuff to say. my personal favorite episode is in the last season. the humor is a nice mix of \"dumb person\" jokes(mainly related to the high-schoolers), silliness, dark comedy and crude material. this dealt with sex and other adult topics, but never in a graphic manner. the language is mild, and, on occasion, moderately strong. i recommend this to any fan of those who made it. 8/10 brilliant thriller, deserving far more fame, mitchum and ryan are awesome in their starring roles, as is the entire supporting cast. a truly gripping film noir featuring some wonderfully images and some great dialogue, at the heart of it all is a strong message of tolerance and understanding. based on a novel concerning homophobia, this movie attacks post-war anti-emitism, and all intolerance and hatred, with considerable power. though parts may seem a little preachy to modern audiences, it still has the power to shock, and works very well as a thriller in its own right. a credit to all involved. i saw this movie a fews years ago and was literally swept away by it. so charming and so very romantic. david duchovny and ms. driver have chemistry that is so hot, you will need to take off a layer of clothing. the supporting cast is 100% top notch. just watching caroll o\\'connor and robert loggia play off one another is pure poetry. bonnie hunt and jim bellushi and a wonderful team and some of the films most charming moments are when they are on the screen. like jim belushi screaming at his children to go to sleep \"forever!\" or him dancing in the kitchen. this film made we wish i knew people like that in my own life. not to mention, what woman does not want david duchovny for a boyfriend? i just watched this movie on bravo! and it was absolutely horrible. it has the plot of a shannon tweed movie without the nudity. the premise was interesting enough, a winning lottery ticket in a secluded area and people who have reasons why they want the money. the characters were trite as were the observations on human nature and greed. for a movie called class warfare it had very little to do with class differences other than the first 20 minutes and the predictable ending. this movie could have done a lot better if there had been more characters with motivations to get the ticket and was a \"who done it?\" the acting wasn\\'t fantastic but it\\'s hard to seem believable with such a terrible script. lindsey mckeon is very cute and i\\'d like to see what she could do in a better production with a better script. she\\'s probably the only reason why i sat through the whole movie. how nice to have a movie the entire family can watch together. josie bissett and rob estes (who are married in real life) play a couple who marry in las vegas on a whim and then not only have to break the news to their kids but then have to try to meld their respective households (each has two boys and two girls)into a cohesive family unit. what transpires when the group, which includes four teenagers, two preteens and two younger children, makes one wonder at first if there can ever be true happiness for carrie and jim. the fights between the kids (and one little love affair between two of them) make one wonder if everyone will ever be able to get along. more interesting than the brady bunch, what this is a totally enjoyable way to spend a couple hours. recommended as a feel good movie for all ages. as a fan of henriksen (i liked him in the \"millennium\" series) and of course lorenzo \"renegade\" lamas, i had expected at least something from this film. sadly, the plot is predictable, the acting is bad and the computergraphics used for most stunts don\\'t work out. sometimes it even looks like they\\'ve captured some shots from microsoft flight simulator. the cinematography sucks as well. unnecessary funky camerawork in the beginning only detracts (from the cheesy dialogue) and gives the film a cheap, made-for-video-look. it works in hiphop-movies and jet li movies, but seems out of place in this flick. i would have liked this film 10 years ago. i was 11 then. in theory, films should be a form of entertainment. while this excludes documentaries and other experimental forms of film-making; most movies, specially genre films, must not only tell it\\'s story or message, they must entertain their target audience in some way. all this just to say that in my opinion a bad movie is not a movie with low production values or low-budget, a bad movie is one that is boring. \"hellborn\" or \"asylum of the damned\" as is known in the u.s., is a bad movie simply because it is just not involving, and irremediably boring and tiresome. while it has a very good premise, it is just poorly developed and the mediocre acting doesn\\'t make things better. on another hands the film probably could had been a fine or even classic b-movie, but here it is just a bad attempt at film-making. director philip j. jones tells the tale of james bishop (matt stasi), a young psychiatry resident, who just got his dream job at st. andrew mental hospital; but the old asylum seems to hide a secret. after the mysterious death of some patients and the constant rumors of satanic practices, james decides to find out what is going on; only to find the incredulity of his boss, dr. mccort (bruce payne), who believes that bishop is going as insane as his patients. while the premise is quite interesting, the execution of the film leaves a lot to be desired. in an attempt of making a supernatural psychological thriller, jones goes for the easy way out and makes a movie filled with every clichã© of the genre. of course, there are lots of great movies that are also filled with clichã©s; but in \"hellborn\" every single one is wasted and turned into a cheap jump scare to keep things moving, resulting in a boring and predictable storyline. the acting is quite mediocre for the most part, with one big exception: bruce payne gives a top-notch performance that makes the movie look unworthy of such good acting. matt stasi is very weak as the lead character and the rest of the cast make forgettable performances. despite all this flaws, one thing has to be written about \"hellborn\"; it has a visual look very good for the budget and very similar to modern day big-budget hollywod \"horror\" productions. also, the make-up and prosthetics are done very nicely and the designs for the main antagonist are quite good. sadly, the rest of the special effects are awful and outdated, making a huge contrast with the make-up & prosthetics. \"hellborn\" is a movie with a few good things outnumbered by its serious flaws with terrible results. hardcore horror or b-movie fans may be interested by its premise but it is a boring and tiresome experience. 3/10 bela lugosi is an evil botanist who sends brides poisoned orchids on their wedding day, steals the body in his fake ambulance/hearse and takes it home for his midget assistant to extract the glandular juices in order to keep bela\\'s wife eternally young. some second rate actors playing detectives try to solve the terrible, terrible mystery. bela lugosi hams it up nicely, but you can tell he needed the money. this film is thoroughly awful, and most of the actors would have been better off sticking to waiting tables, but the plot is wonderfully ridiculous. tell anyone what happens in it and they tend to laugh quite a lot and demand to see the film. i got the dvd in a discount store 2 for â£1, which i think is a pretty accurate valuation, anyone paying more for this would be out of their mind. what the hell was this? i\\'ll admit there were some scenes that caught my eye such as the 23 bullshit where the protagonist sees or calculates the number 23 everywhere he goes, but that was pretty much the movie in a nutshell?! for crying out loud this was supposed to be a suspense movie and being labeled as a psychological thriller i would have expected it to have at least some catastrophic effect on the mind but instead what did we get? we just got something as shitty as an animal control guy finding himself in the middle of a mid-life crisis and his journey to redemption. kinda like an old-man flick if you ask me. i probably should have just rented wild hogs, it wouldn\\'t have made a difference. i mean who are we kidding, they should have made someone else the killer of that girl. by juxtaposing sparrow with the protagonist of that book the number 23 they were pretty much giving out the movie to the viewers by hinting that he was the killer all along. how would that have shaken our heads? shame on all of you voters who chose to show some generosity towards this wretched piece of work you call a movie and kudos to most of the critics who concurred with my reaction. i have to say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel \"jane eyre\". both dalton and clarke are very believable as rochester and jane. i\\'ve seen other versions, but none compare to this one. the best one for me. i could never imagine anyone else playing these characters ever again. the last time i saw this one was in 1984 when i was only 13. at that time, i was a bookworm and i had just read charlotte bronte\\'s novel. i was completely enchanted by this miniseries and i remember not missing any of the episodes. i\\'d like to see it again because it\\'s so good. :-) doesn\\'t mean this movie is good. i was really frustrated by it on many levels. it\\'s kind of the tip of the hat to bukowski. hey, i\\'ve read that guy in college--let\\'s see what matt dillon does with him. and i like matt dillon. i thought he came close to looking a little like hank, but mostly just the ruddy cheeks. i have to care about a character, though, and there just wasn\\'t much here to care about. i think time might be cruel to bukowski, and that bothers me a lot, because the writing was solid in a sort of post counter culture time. hard to sit through, scenes that went nowhere, and a soundtrack that made me want to vomit. i ask for very little, got less. my roommate and i have another friend that works at a local blockbuster video. he finds truly awful movies for us and tells us about them. one of them was a \"christmas horror\" film starring former professional wrestler bill goldberg as a killer satna claus. we didn\\'t watch it immediately, but we didn\\'t think there could be anything worse. apparently, we were wrong. we were shown this slasher film \"starring\" ken shamrock versus a murderous scarecrow. at first we thought ken would actually be the killer scarecrow, and that\\'s why we wanted to watch, but he wasn\\'t, and that made the movie even worse. what absolutely ruined the movie was the teen drama. if you want to save your brain cells from trying to escape from your head, never ever watch this movie. this movie seemed like it was put together very quickly in both plot and graphics. my two daughters were ready to go 30 minutes before the end of the movie which rarely happens when we go to the theaters. this was a nickelodeon production and it would have been better if they had released it on the t.v. station. the animation itself in some parts was o.k. but the plot was horrible. a classic tale of a son trying to fulfill a fathers expectations is used in a lot of kids movies, but the animation or graphics need to be really good to keep a childs attention. this was not the case with this film. there were also awkward elements between the lead male character and the lead female character that the plot could have done without. this review is for the extended cut of this movie. i first watched dragon lord when i bought it on dvd many years ago. i always liked this movie and you can read some of the more positive reviews of it to get the general idea. that being said. i\\'ve always found the storyline a bit confusing. the movie is, after all, a love story. and it always seemed strange to me that a love story should end with a 20 minute fight scene. well, in the extended version this is no longer so. the old \"original\" version begins off with a huge barrel-climb/rugby-like sequence which is the new ending sequence in the extended version. the opening sequence is dragon(jackie chan) hanging around his house and pretending to be training and reciting whenever his father is around. other sequenced have also been shift or prolonged in the extended cut and the story makes a lot more sense when you watch it. the pacing is also better and overall it just works better. it feels more like a love story and doesn\\'t leave you asking questions about why it ends so drastically and dramatically as the regular version does. i suggest everyone who is a hong-kong cinema, or just plain jackie chan fanatic to get a hold of the extended version and watch the movie the way it was originally intended.(or at least that\\'s how i think it was intended. why else would they make it and rearrange some of the scenes) when i was done watching it, i felt like i had watched a completely new jackie chan movie although most of the sequences were the same. detective tony rome (frank sinatra) returns to the screen after his self titled debut, this time it\\'s a film that\\'s played for ermâ…laughs. while on a diving trip, rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea, her feet as you might expect, encased in cement. rome immediately on the case after being hired by man mountain waldo gronsky. rome finds himself immediately at risk as he has to investigate some mafia types, who turn the tables on him and he is himself found to be the main suspect, he must now go on the run and hope to solve the case alone. the portly sinatra tries hard to sell us the lame jokes and make us believe he is a good detective, oh and not to mention being sexually attractive to the foxy raquel welch, but he fails miserably, in this ham fisted vanity project. the frankly laughable denouement that surrounds every female is quite astounding, every woman in the film is a dither head, who likes bending over is front of the camera, director douglas of course obliges in zooming in on the cracks of their asses each time as they flex their posterior muscles. there\\'s even a ridiculously campy gay character that beggars belief, this was a film made by \"real men\" for \"real men\" to reaffirm their own flagging sexuality, it\\'s a shameful shambles. having been interested in akhenaton for many years i was surprised to learn about this film via e-bay and bought a copy on dvd for 99p. i enjoyed the film, the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character sinuhe makes it more of a \"family saga\" rather than an action film. the costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time (1955). the back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy. my main interest was in the character of akhenaton and his monotheistic religion. in this film he was portrayed as being \"jesus\" like in his refusal to go to war with the hittites even through they were invading egypt and in his closing speech about the futility of materiality and political power. initially one makes a connection between sinuhe, who was cast adrift in the river nile in a reed basket, and the old testament moses. but this connection is not carried no doubt this will be fully explored in a new film wherein a moses like character carries akhenaton\\'s monotheistic religion out to the wider world, if such a film will ever be politically possible to make. it is universally accepted that were women are concerned we man are stupid creatures but the relationship or lack of one between sinuhe and merit, the character played by jean simmons is hard to accept. and that sinuhe, an educated physician, would be so smitten by nefer the babylonian \"femme fatal\" to the extent of giving her his adopted parents house and tomb is not really believable, neither that his parents would even have a tomb. in real life nefer (nefertitti) was the wife of akhenaton. and although horemheb did become pharaoh it was after a few others including tutankhamen , who was the son of akhenaton. but of course this is just nit picking and the film is enjoyable to watch and that it is about akhenaton and his monotheistic religion is a big bonus. maybe following \"the de vinci code\" book and film this film be re-made with the central secret being the foundation of our current monotheism! i wait in great anticipation of such a film, there are already numerous books on the subject. this is an hilarious movie. one of the very best things about it is the quality of the performance by each actor. from the largest role to the smallest, each character is vivid, unforgettable and so understandable. it can also make you laugh so hard your health will improve. amicus made close to a good half dozen of these horror anthologies in the 70\\'s, and this, from leading horror scribe robert bloch, is one of their best efforts. there are four stories, all worthwhile, but two -- \"sweets for the sweet\" and \"method for murder\" -- distinguish themselves as highly effective journeys into fear. in \"sweets\", christopher lee plays an impatient widower whose lovely daughter (chloe franks) becomes resentful of his neglect and brutish intolerance, so she sculpts a voodoo doll with which she expresses her distaste for his methods. franks is a beautiful figure of mischievous evil and delivers one of the greatest child performances in a horror film since martin stephens in \"the innocents\". this installment is directed with great subtlety and the final outrage, occurring off-screen, is a moment of purest horror. \"method of murder\" is about a horror novelist (denholm elliott) who is menaced by one of his own creations, the creepy dominic. this episode is striking for its simplicity and stark terror. dominic may or may not be real, so director peter duffell has a great time playing with our expectations. the brief shots of dominic reflected in a pond or seen as a fleeting phantasm in a meadow are truly haunting. the original poster art, featuring a skeletal figure clasping a tray holding peter cushing\\'s severed head, was a rich enticement for punters fixed on fear. let\\'s start from this point: this is not a movie intended for the common audience. utterly bizarre, somehow incomprehensible, totally unpredictable, it just keep you stoned watching at the screen trying to figure out what will happen next. if that by itself doesn\\'t make you agree it is an excellent movie, then go back to your \"family\" movies and forget about motorama. it has material to be considered a cult movie, it can be placed in the same category with movies that win awards in cannes or other intellectual film festivals, but, sadly, hollywood already let if fall in oblivion, simply because it is not commercial. the performance of young jordan christopher michael may not be oscar material, but he gives the right touch to the story. even the genre is difficult to describe; it is not a comedy in the proper sense, you don\\'t know if you are supposed to laugh at the strange situations in which gus gets involved. it is more like an impossible adventure that some kids may wish to have, but don\\'t let them watch it either... it is not a movie for kids. so, if you like disney movies or are looking for a \"home alone\" style, this one is definitively not for you. but if you enjoy reading edgar alan poe or the works of tim burton, then you will like motorama. so, jump in your red mustang, get a tattoo spelling \"tora\" and cruise strangeland with gus. i\\'d like that... this is the worst movie i have ever seen. the story line is a joke, the effects are terrible, the cinematography doesn\\'t fit the tone of the movie, the dialogue is cheesy, and the actors do a good job at screwing up the rest. people just don\\'t act that way in real life situations. my question is: who would fund such crap? the movie starts where some miners fall down a mine shaft after a fireman fails to save them. next we join some bikers in a forest who ride around doing stunts on their bikes. one guy falls and breaks his leg or something. the fireman arrives to help them. meanwhile, somebody starts a fire. some more bike stunts. bla bla bla. i wasted my time. do not watch this movie. the somewhat-belligerent brother of a suicide finds that he and his mother grieve in much the same way (by acting out) but that dad is morose and blaming himself. writer-director dan harris gives us a dysfunctional family torn at the seams, characters with question marks hanging over them, and then lays all the story-points out in the most obvious terms: suicide! secrets! gay shame! family sickness! ultimately aiming to wrap things up with a tidy bow, harris wants to make sure we don\\'t miss a trick, initially giving us thoughtful material to ponder but then spelling everything out in an elementary, sentimental fashion. sigourney weaver\\'s bemused performance as the family matriarch is dryly disengaged and she\\'s a joy--that is, until harris gives her a make-over (complete with sensible new hairstyle). it\\'s the cinematic equivalent of a condescending pat on the head. ** from **** i haven\\'t had a chance to view the previous film, but from what i\\'ve read on other posts it was supposedly worse than this one, although i doubt that is possible. i\\'m a huge fan of the \"zombie\" genre, and i am fascinated by the psychological aspects of viewing creatures, that for all intents and purposes are human, as an atrocity that is only worth shooting in the head. that said, hotd 2 takes the \"zombie\" movie to an all new low. without giving any big spoilers (which i really should do just so you won\\'t bother wasting your time actually watching this movie) i would like to express my utter contempt for the way the writers of this film portray our countries special forces. gomer pile could have probably survived longer than the \"spec ops\" soldiers in this film. for crying out loud they should have called them the special education forces instead. if you are going to write a script where you send in an elite team to deal with an outbreak of zombies, at least have the soldiers be smarter than the walking corpses. i understand that you have to kill off some or most of the team, but you can find better ways to do it than having them set down their machine guns and walk over to lay a tender hand on the shoulder of the drooling crazy person rocking back and forth in the corner of the dark creepy basement. the writers actually try to take the whole zombie thing to a more high-tech level by making it a virus that they are searching for a vaccine for, and the idea has merit, if it wasn\\'t stuck in the middle of such a ridiculous display of wayward film making. i mean come on, zombie films aren\\'t exactly \"high art\", and the viewer expects some tongue-in-cheek cheesiness along with the gore and thrills, but hotd 2 is the type of cheese that makes you turn the channel in disgust and awe of the sheer stupidity of the characters. if you are a zombie movie fan like me, please do yourself a favor and stay away from this one. my husband and i just got done watching this movie. i was not expecting it to be this good! i was really astonished at how great the story line was. i\\'m usually very good at figuring out twisty plots...but this one had me. i loved it! i\\'m going to have to watch it again before i take it back. i might even have to buy it. :) how did mike hammer live - in a penthouse with a golf bag stashed in the corner next to a big screen cathode ray tube tv and a snazzy fireplace? nah, he\\'d knock back a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered camels on the couch or floor of his fly-specked office or in the stink of a lousy downtown la flop house, wiping the dried red crust and oil smeared mud off his face, that\\'s how. spillane wrote trash paperbacks, for sure, but how do you make it worse? give some desperate scheming producer a blank check because he thinks any film noir titled crap will sell at the box office, add some over-the-hill hot tomatoes and just generally screw-up the story-line by some retard, drugged out screen writer, that\\'s how! last year, i fell in love with the tim burton\\'s version of sweeney todd so i wanted to check out the other versions of this musical and i found this one at the library. though i think burton\\'s is best, probably because i like film a lot better than theater, this is still a great production of the story. i haven\\'t seen any of the other versions but i am trying to get my hands on them. after seeing johnny depp as todd, it\\'s hard for me to imagine anyone else in the role, but george hearn does a fantastic job. angela lansbury is great, as always and all of the singing is fantastic. i found myself singing along. this is a play you won\\'t want to miss, but try and see it before you see the film version so you won\\'t have a biased view like me. i was very impressed with what eddie monroe was able to accomplish in regards to its overall affect on me. i say this because i know this independent film had a limited budget/resources, but despite this, it comes across as a convincing and well crafted piece of work. enjoyable from start to finish with several relatively unknown actors which i can\\'t help but believe will make a big noise in the industry in years to come, eddie monroe didn\\'t fail to keep my interest engaged and my emotional meter dancing. it\\'s a well scripted story with a startling ending despite my effort to not be taken off guard. many of the cast names listed for this film are names to look out for in the future. someone told me that paul regina recently passed, and if this is true it\\'s a real tragedy since his stoic performance in eddie monroe is remarkable. kudos to fred carpenter who has truly pulled out a winner with this one! this is a very unusual film in that the star with the top billing doesn\\'t appear literally until half way in. nevertheless i was engaged by the hook of the phantom lady. curtis, though competent as the falsely accused scott henderson, looks a little tough to be be sympathetic towards (perhaps he should have shaved his moustache) and his behavior when he first comes home should have convinced the cops at least to some degree of his innocence. while another commentator had a problem with franchot tone as jack marlowe i found his portrayal of the character to be impressively complex. he is no stock villain. superb character actor elisha cook jr. is again in top form as the \\'little man with big ambitions.\\' his drumming in the musical numbers added a welcome touch of eroticism. this movie however is carried by the very capable and comely ella raines as the devoted would be lover of henderson, carol richmond. she definitely has talent and her screen presence is in the tradition of lauren bacall. this is the first of her work i have seen and i am definitely inclined to see her other roles. the rest of the supporting cast is also more than competent. all in all a very satisfying film noir mystery which when viewed today fully conveys the dark and complex urban world it is intended to. recommended, 8/10. wasted is just that, a waste of time. mtv is churning out made for tv movies at quite a clip nowadays. a friend of mine recommended this and i rented it, needless to say i will not be pursuing anymore recomendations from her anytime soon. this movie shows the rollercoaster of drug use. the problem is, you really don\\'t care about any of the characters due to lack of believabilty and their own self discipline. this movie is in a word, annoying to watch, from the terrible camera angles to the quality of dialogue and pacing. the \\'digital\\' format tries for realism, but comes up distracting. if you want a true scope on drug use watch requiem for a dream. i really think i should make my case and have every(horror and or cult)movie-buff go and see this movie... i did! it-is-excellent: very atmospheric and unsettling and scary... incridible how they could make such a gem of a film with the very low(read-\"no\"!)-budget they had.... synopsis taken from website: \"one morning, an old man wanders out into the woods in search of his runaway cat. he finds instead a child without parents and a murder with no corpse...\" on this website(imdb) there is no trailer, but i will leave a link here to the site of the movie itself where there is a trailer which is quite unsettling so please go and check it out... www.softfordigging.com i first saw enchanted april about five years ago. i loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy the following christmas. it\\'s about two women who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april, leaving their humdrum lives behind them. they are very sad women at the outset of the film, and you can\\'t help but root them on as they plan this get-away with two other women they invite along to share the expenses. this is perhaps the most feel good movie i have ever seen. it\\' pure and simple, with no car chases, no animosities and no deaths. it was made with care and in very good taste. you cannot help but smile all through it -- except when you\\'re crying happy tears! i\\'m a 53 year-old college professor. i went with my wife and 12 year old daughter. we all enjoyed the movie. the film is original, witty, fast-paced and totally charming. the plot was easy enough for a 10 year old to follow, but twisty enough to keep an adult interested. i thought emma roberts did a superb job and the rest of the cast was just fine. my only criticism is that the los angeles sets were not as interesting as they should have been. they were functional, but nothing stood out. on the other hand, make-up, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing and directing were excellent. altogether, i thought it was a totally enjoyable experience. i am disappointed that the professional critics (almost all adult males) savagely attacked the film. apparently, they have something against films that portray strong, intelligent and independent young women. their writings reveal more about their own sexist natures than anything about this wonderful family film. i recommend it strongly to every child and every parent. in my lit. class we\\'ve just finished the book, hatchet, and this movie is nothing like the book. (1) brian never ate worms in the book. (2) he didn\\'t know the pilot\\'s name. (3) his mom was cheating on his father in a station wagon not in the woods where anyone could see. (4) the man the mother is cheating with doesn\\'t have black hair, he has blonde. now for the unrealistic parts of the movie: (1) a thirteen year old can\\'t punch his fist through a window in one punch. and for the acting, the kid who played brian was a horrible actor. however, i do believe that the scenery was impressive, though i highly doubt the director even read the book. this movie is good if you have not read the book hatchet, by gary paulsen, but if you have, then begin a complaint letter to the director. this show has to be my favorite out of all the 80\\'s horror tv shows. like tales from the darkside, also from the same creators, this show is a rare gem. if you agree with me, please sign this petition i started, to get the word out for monsters and get it out on dvd. here is the petition address: www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html some of my favorite episodes would have to be glim glim, and rain dance. i also loved the opening intro with the monster family. that used to creep me out! one of the things i would have to ask the dvd creators to include would be the organ sound heard right before where the commercial break would be. i don\\'t know if any of you remember that part but that\\'s one of the main things that brings back memories to me. i mean, come on! war of the worlds the tv series already has been released on dvd, so i say monsters, and also tales from the darkside, and friday the 13th the series should be released too! we the fans need to speak our minds! we need this awesome show on dvd so please spread the word!!! this is going to be the most useless comment i have ever put down, but yet i must do it to warn you about the atrocity to cinema that \"freddy\\'s dead\" is. it is not only the very worst chapter of the nightmare series, but is right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time! it was boring, pointless, and nearly death free. the horrible 3-d ending and over-the-top corny kills are enough to drive this \"film\" into the ground. however, it doesn\\'t stop there, just add bad acting, a terrible script, and a number of cheesy cameos and you\\'ve got yourself this heaping pile of guano! it\\'s no wonder why freddy, as always played by robert englund, has made two postmortem appearances. i would too if i went out like that. this is a strictly fans only movie, don\\'t stare at our shame. this is one of the movies of dev anand who gave great yet distinct movies to hindi movie industries such as jewel thief and guide. the story is short (if you ask me what is the story), plot is simple- a brother seeks for his lost sister. sister has joined the hippies who smoke from pot and chant hare rama hare krishna. yet the movie portrays few of the significant events that the world experienced in 70\\'s.hippie culture, their submission to drugs, freedom ,escaping duty, family, and adopting anything new such as eastern (which was new for whites) religion. they have been handled perfectly. zeenat gave her best and dev as usual was remarkable. songs are the best used (unlike they are abused for the sake of having songs) in this movie. they have not been spoiled.one perfect example is \\'dekho o deewano...ram ka naam badnam na karo\\'. each word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful. the end is tragic but that is not the essence of the movie. overall devji who does believe in making different movies has been successful in showing what he wanted to show here. a must see to experience hippie culture and beautiful nepal of 70\\'s. as an aging rocker, this movie mentions heep and quo - my 2 favourite bands ever - but with the incredible cast (everyone) - and the fantastic storyline - i just love this piece of creative genius. i cannot recommend it more highly - and mick jones added so much (foreigner lead and primary songwriter along with the greatest rock singer ever - lou gramm) - i have watched this great work more than 10 times- bill nighy - what a voice - and jimmy nail - talent oozes from every pore - then astrid.... and karen..... what more could an aging rocker ask for!! 10/10 - bloody brilliant. alastair, perth, western oz, originally from windsor, england. winchester 73 gets credit from many critics for bringing back the western after wwii. director anthony mann must get a lot of credit for his excellent direction. jimmy stewart does an excellent job, but i think stephen mcnalley and john mcintire steal the movie with their portrayal of two bad guys involved in a high stakes poker game with the treasured winchester 73 going to the winner. this is a good script with several stories going on at the same time. look for the first appearance of rock hudson as young bull. thank god, with in a few years, we would begin to let indians play themselves in western films. the film is in black and white and was shot in tucson arizona. i would not put winchester 73 in the category of stagecoach, high noon or shane, but it gets an above average recommendation from me. . i am sad to say that i disagree with other people on this columbo episode. death lends a hand is frankly kind of a boring columbo to me. after a few times, i get bored and changed the channel. i still love robert culp and patricia crowley and ray milland in their roles but the story was weaker in this episode than in the others. first, robert culp plays an investigator for ray milland\\'s character. he hires him to investigate his young pretty wife played by patricia crowley to see if she is having an affair. in return, culp\\'s character blackmails the cheating wife who plans to expose his scheme to her husband ruining his career. out of anger, culp kills her by striking her in the face and setting the up the body elsewhere. i don\\'t know. maybe i just didn\\'t care for this one at all. of course, columbo gets him in the end. it\\'s just the question of how. prison is not often brought up during conversations about the best eighties horror films, and there\\'s a good reason for that because it\\'s not one of the best...but as you delve past the classic films that the decade had to offer, this is certainly among the best of the lesser known/smaller films. the film does have some connection to blockbusters; for a start it\\'s an early directorial effort for renny harlin; the capable director behind a number of action films including die hard 2, cliffhanger and deep blue sea; and secondly we have an early role for lord of the rings star viggo mortensen. the film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting. we focus on a prison that has been reopened after a number of years. this was the prison where a man named charles forsyth was sent to the electric chair after being framed by the prison\\'s governor. naturally, the spirit of the dead man is not resting in peace; and when the old execution room is reopened, the spirit of the dead convict escapes for vengeance. the film is not exactly the shawshank redemption, but it does take care to build up its various characters and while the main point of the film is always the horror, the prison drama behind it all does make for an interesting base. this is a good job too because other than the basic premise, the film doesn\\'t really have a \\'plot\\' to go from and we solely rely on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting. the horror featured in the film is at times grotesque but it\\'s never over the top, which might actually be the reason why this film is seldom remembered, being released in a decade of excess. the murders themselves are rather good and imaginative, however, and provide some major highlights. as the film goes on, we start to delve more into the back-story of the vengeful convict\\'s ghost and while it\\'s fairly interesting, some things about it don\\'t make sense and it drags the film down a little. still, everything boils down to an exciting climax and overall i have to say that prison is a film well worth tracking down. butch the peacemaker? evidently. after the violent beginning with spike, tom and jerry all swinging away at each other, butch calls a halt and wants to know why. it\\'s a good question. \"cats can get along with dogs, can\\'t they?\" he asks tom, who nods his head in agreement. \"mice can get along with cats, right?\" jerry nods \"no,\" and then sees that isn\\'t the right answer. they go inside and butch draws up a \"peace treaty\" (complete with professional artwork!). most of the rest, and the bulk of the cartoon, is the three of them being extremely nice to one another what a refreshing change-of-pace. i found it fun to watch. i can a million of these cartoons in which every beats each other over the head. anyway, you knew the peace wasn\\'t going to last. a big piece of steak spells the death of the \"peace treaty\" but en route it was nice change and still had some of usual tom & jerry clever humor. like in so many movies of the past, you would think hollywood would learn this by now, makes for a very disappointing movie, not to mention, make sure the kidnapped victim is alive first before paying the ransom. maybe this film wants to remind of these basic facts in case it should ever happen to one of us. why the long walk in the woods and can a city guy really go through the woods without getting lost? just an opportunity for some sentimental dialog that was meaningless in the end. i had to listen to part of the director\\'s comments in the special features section, from the great moves that redford has made in the past, (sneakers for one) surprised he agreed to star in such a film. the director\\'s comments and reasons were weak. the best parts of this movie was the scenery, can\\'t wait for spring to come. i really wanted to write a title for this review that didn\\'t come off as corny or gushing but still described my feelings for this show. i can see now that it is not possible. \"american family\" is one of the best shows i have ever had the pleasure of watching on television. several reviewers here on imdb have mentioned the word \"beautiful\" when describing this show. never has a word been more fitting. the cinematography for this show is stunning. every scene and shot looks like a masterpiece. the lighting, camera moves, scene composition and colors...i have to keep reminding myself that i\\'m watching a tv show and not a motion picture masterpiece. the score by lee holdridge and nathan wang brings tears to my eyes. and most importantly, the acting by the all around amazing cast is honest and sincere. i do not feel like i am watching performances...i feel like i\\'m watching real life. if only real life could be this beautiful. \"american family\" has indeed raised the bar for quality entertainment on television. i highly recommend this show to anyone who is willing to watch it. i could easily chide cbs for passing on this show, but i have to say that it doesn\\'t matter to me who airs it. i\\'m just glad it\\'s out there for everyone to see. so i do thank pbs for not allowing this show to disappear into nothingness. i have to give special recognition to the way each season\\'s finale ended. the first one was pure creative brilliance and it moved me to tears. i was waiting to see if season two would also end in a creative way, and sure enough it did. again, tears. my thanks to all of those involved. you really have made a special piece of art with this show, and i sincerely mean that. it is a shame that we only got two seasons, but a miracle we got anything at all. i saw this film at a special screening. at first i thought the movie would be like a typical amanda bynes movie, but i was wrong. the movie is based on the shakespeares book \"the twelth night\" this movie tells the story of a girl who lives to play soccer. well when the girls team is cut she has to go to great lengths to get on the guys team at a different school to get revenge on the egotistical guys team at her old school. on her way she gets caught up in a long tangled web of love, lies, and deception. this movie is this years mean girls. i think it shows some great new actors abilities and there are defiantly some big stars to be featured in this movie. i saw this kung fu movie when i was a kid, and i thought it was so cool! now i am 26 years old, and my friend has it on dvd!!! we got a case of brew, and watched this classic! it lost none of it\\'s original kung fu coolness! if you are a fan of kung fu/karate movies, this is a must see... the dvd is available. i believe this movie is also called \"pick your poison\". watch it soon! ...and there were quite a few of these. i do not like this cartoon as much as many others, partly because it was made in its period. i much prefer cartoons with daffy and bugs which are fifteen or so years before-hand. many people will like this, particularly people who always find violence funny, cartoon or not. the basic plot is a pretty well known one for looney tunes: elmer goes out hunting, daffy leads him to bugs and daffy ends up being shot instead. also inserted are quite clever and highly entertaining jokes (some do not enhance the episode), ugly shooting and animation which is slightly mediocre. the plot is mainly geared by jokes - each joke keeps the episode going. this way of plot-going is not all that unusual in looney tunes (of course if you are pretty much a looney tunes boffin - or an eager one - like me, then you\\'ll know this already). for people who love everything about looney tunes and daffy duck and like the sound of what i have said about it, enjoy \"rabbit seasoning\"! 7 and a half out of ten. others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements. i think they were trying to capture what you\\'d be looking at when attending a live performance. the feet, the faces, the overall view. unfortunately, it falls a bit short. but, having said that, watching colin dunne is nevertheless gratifying. it\\'s an interesting contrast to michael flatley in the original video. the progression of the show is evident, changes from the original dublin production are evident. \"trading taps\" is the highlight of the video, in my opinion. tarik winston is unbelievable, as is his partner in the piece. i think the audio was better in this version than the original video production (1995). in dolby 5.1 on dvd it\\'s excellent. despite the flawed videography, it\\'s a must-own for riverdance fans. when i saw this in the cinema, i remember wincing at the bad acting about a minute or two into the first scene, then immediately telling myself \"no, this has to get better\". it didn\\'t. the performances are pretty uniformly teak \\'n pine and no, there is no sexual chemistry in this film whatsoever, just the awkward posturings of a reasonably comely, discreetly talentless actress who seems born to grace the cover of \"interviãº\" and not much else besides. if the scriptwriter thought that making mã©rimã©e a character was a stunningly original creative ploy he perhaps ought to get out more. and aranda, if he\\'d given the matter a bit more thought, would have realised that the story of carmen is just crying out for a thoughtful, iconoclastic, parodic deconstruction, not this leave-your-brains-at-the-turnstile affair of ersatz passion and comic-book dialogue. this is contemporary spanish cinema at its worst. de palma\\'s technique had hit its high maturity by the time of this film, which is a wonderful showcase of his classic techniques, though unfortunately, as with many of the films written by de palma himself, the story serves the meta more than the interests of putting forth an emotionally compelling tale. the story opens with a crazy scene in which angie dickinson masturbates in a shower while she looks at her husband. she is then grabbed and raped while he husband stands obliviously nearâ—-and the whole thing is revealed to be angie\\'s fantasy as he husband is pumping mindlessly away at her in bed. she has a short scene with her son, a dead ringer for harry potter, which concludes with a joke that \"she\\'ll tell grandma that he is playing with his peter.\" she then goes to her therapy session, where she complains about her dead marriage, before attempting to seduce her therapist, michael caine. he refuses, and she is hurt and feeling unattractive and unfulfilled. then begins a bravura 22-minute nearly wordless sequence that is perhaps the highlight of the film. among the many things de palma gleaned from hitchcock is the understanding of film as a purely visual medium of telling storiesâ… and in typical de palma fashion, he turns this into a way to show off his formidable skill. the problem, for me, is that in this instance one begins to feel that scenes are being needlessly protracted simply to further show off the director\\'s skill. the sequence begins with angie at an art museum. she watches strangers, all involved in sexual or family activities, then begins to get turned on to a man sitting next to her. de palma very skillfully tells an extremely complicated narrative without a single word about angie\\'s attraction, embarrassment, retreating, and finally finding and submitting to the stranger in the back of a taxi cab, all set to a wonderfully lush score by pino donaggio, who also scored carrie. in the second part of the sequence angie has slept with the guy, and gets up to return to her husband. again de palma crams a ton of narrative in without a word of dialogue uttered, as angie realizes that she doesn\\'t have her panties, that her husband is already home and no doubt wondering where she is, that she has probably contracted a venereal disease, and that she has lost her engagement ring somewhere in the shuffle. it\\'s all very admirable, but one begins to feel a little strung along as we are forced to do things like take a long elevator ride down from the seventh floor, then up again, almost in real time. ...spoilers from here on out! when angie reaches the seventh floor again, she is killed by a big woman with blond hair. the woman hacks away at her until she reaches the ground floor, when the door opens and nancy allen sees her there. there is a wonderful slow-motion sequence as nancy reaches into the elevator, angie reaches up toward her, and the killer\\'s blade is held poised to slash nancy\\'s hands. then follow some electrifying shots as nancy looks up and sees the killer in the elevators convex mirror. it\\'s all good, and by the time we have some dialogue again, you think; \"woah, that was just 22 straight minutes of purely visual narrative!\" or maybe you don\\'t, but i do. a younger dennis franz has a great part as a sleazy and tough new york detective who would rather that everyone else do his work for him. he interviews michael caine, making the outrageous implication (though it passes as commonplace) that angie wanted to be killed. angie\\'s son is there as well, and he hooks up with nancy, and they set about to spy on caine\\'s therapist and find out who the killer is. once again there is a strong tie to a hitchcock film, in this case psycho (just as obsession is a re-working of vertigo). you have a woman who we are supposed to understand is secretly a slut, who gets killed in the first 30 minutes in an enclosed space, in this case an elevator rather than a shower. then the relatives of the deceased conduct an investigation, which reveals that the killer is a man who dresses as a woman to kill. de palma even throws in a doctor at the end who explains the psychology of the whole thing. it is very interesting, but at the same time a viewer can begin to feel a bit jerked around, and that is my primary reservation about this film. it is definitely essential viewing and showcases some of de palma\\'s greatest setpieces, but that feeling that the story is running a solid third behind the need for de palma to show off and his somewhat unseemly sexual fantasies makes it hard to look back on this one with whole-hearted affection. --- check out other reviews on my website of bad and cheesy movies, cinema de merde, cinemademerde.com having read many of the comments here, i\\'m surprised that no one has recognized this as basically an overlong remake of a twilight zone episode from 1960 called \"mirror image,\" starring vera miles. rod serling did a much better job of creating an effective spooky tale in 24 minutes than sean ellis did in 88 minutes with this tedious snooze. a short piece can be effective with a mysterious and unexplained ending, but in a feature film, there should be a bit more substance and the story should make sense. sadly, substance and sense are two things missing from \"the broken.\" yes, it has some moments, but they are not enough to justify your time. some further observations: although this is clearly a contemporary story, not one character in the movie has a cellphone! and even though a car accident is the event that gets the story going, there is never any reference to an insurance company, to the person who was driving the other car, or to the police who would have been required to do a report. my advice: skip this bore and watch the original instead! just got around to seeing monster man yesterday. it had been a long wait and after lots of anticipation and build up, i\\'m glad to say that it came through and met my expectations on every level. true, you really can\\'t expect too much from hearing the plot rundown, but after reading some of the reviews for it, i was ecstatic. i mean, what trash fan wouldn\\'t want to see a gore flick about a deranged inbred hick mowing people down with his make-shift monster truck? i went in expecting a cross between road trip and the hills have eyes and got so much more. this was a horror comedy that actually worked. the film makers got it right when it came to making you squirm and making you howl with laughter at the same time. kudos to michael davis for going all out with the gore and pushing the envelope with the sickass humor. let me list just a few reasons why i love this movie so much: first off is the story. it\\'s been done to death in so many other flicks. a college guy gets wind that his childhood crush is getting married. he, being the 25 year old virgin that he is, hops in his vista cruiser and decides to take the road trip to confess his love, hoping that she will fall head over hills and all that good jive. hidden in the backseat of his station wagon, is good buddy harley. harley is the loudmouth, former friend, who laughs and talks just like jack black in high fidelity. you can\\'t help but like the guy, but if he was your friend in real life, you\\'d have to keep a whiffle ball bat handy(laugh all you want, but have you ever been hit with one?) to keep him in check. so, he\\'s a little on the obnoxious side, to say the least, but you can tell that he\\'s a loyal friend, deep down...anyway, they\\'re on the road and when they stop in a bar, they aggravate the locals. now they\\'re being stalked by a leatherface clone in a monster truck. that\\'s it. yeah, along the way they pick up a gorgeous hitchhiker but i\\'m too lazy and hungover to go into that right now... so just watch the damn movie. second thing i love was the humor. this one had some of the sickest laughs of any movie since cabin fever. just how messed up is it? well, i won\\'t even go into the whole cat scene and as for the \"corpse burrito\" thing, i\\'ll leave that to your virgin eyes as well. the bar full of amputees was somewhat disturbing and that guy who looked like john turturro bothered me too. harley, although a totally obnoxious frat-boy type, can really sling off the one liners. love the clogs, by the way. i need a new pair.. the gore. this one pours it on heavy. while the first hour plays out as a demented road comedy, the last third is all about blood and guts. if the movie hadn\\'t kept such a light tone throughout, it would have been a little disturbing, but seeing how it was all played for laughs, there is no way possible that you will be bothered by it. if you\\'re still in your seat by the time it comes, you\\'ll probably see the humor in it too, but seriously, there were buckets and buckets of the red stuff. there was a big plot turn that i didn\\'t see coming and when the credits rolled, i was completely satisfied. i had gotten exactly what i came for and i\\'m really glad that i bought it. much like cabin fever, it\\'s going to get a lot of replay. the look of the movie was outstanding. there was this deliberately cheap look that made the whole thing scream late 80s and i loved the exaggerated colors. it\\'s obvious that monster man was done on a relatively low budget, but much like cabin fever (sorry i keep comparing the two) it actually works in the movie\\'s favor. cabin fever was an ode to the 70s greats, this was the 80s answer to that. so take that for what it\\'s worth. no cgi here. this is what we all needed. i\\'m not exactly sure why it didn\\'t get a theatrical release because this is everything that jeepers creepers should have been. thank god for lions gate. i was very moved by the story and because i am going through something similar with my own parents, i really connected. it is so easy to forget that someone whose body is failing was once vibrant and passionate. and then there\\'s the mistakes they made and have to live with. i loved ellen burstyn\\'s performance and who is christine horne? she\\'s fantastic! a real find. there is probably the most erotic scene i\\'ve ever seen in a film, yet nothing was shown - it was just so beautifully done. overall the look and feel of the film was stunning, a real emotional journey. cole hauser is very very good in this picture, he humanizes a man spiraling downwards. i liked the way the filmmaker approached this woman\\'s life, never sentimental, never too much - just enough to hook us in, but not enough to bog down. i have a 19-month old and got really tired of watching care bears all the time. rooney is a great dancer, who cares if he is gay. this guy must have been a cheerleader or something. beats barney, cant get the songs out of my head....must...stop singing........doodlebops songs........now. must have 10 lines of text so i must continue.....what about when the say all the canadian stuff like ooout aboooot. whacky canadians.....jazmine is rhyming too much, she must be dutch. knock knock, who\\'s there, dee dee, super hottie bus driver bob cannot dance, take lessons from rooney what great locations. a visual challenge to all those who put their eye behind the lens.this little jewel is an amazing account of what you can shoot in just 16 days. good going folks!. i can not wait to see what your next feature will be. i\\'ll be with you all the way. the earth is destined to be no more thanks to father pergado and a bunch of nuns. christopher lee (who has since said that he was duped in to appearing in this by his producers who told him loads of great actors were involved) is father pergado and gets to do his usual serious and scary routine. the cast are not too bad, though most have now retired from acting. the film has terrible sound effects (mainly created from pressing keys on an old computer it seems) and it ridiculously pondering at times - showing a scene of the sky, for instance, for what feels like hours at a time. despite this the story is pretty humorous in a world-is-doomed sort of way and the production is adequate. interestingly one scene features albert band and wife jackie; meda band; writer frank ray perilli and charles band\\'s assistant bennah burton. despite its plodding nature i genuinely wanted to see how it all worked out and thus quite liked it. well, where do i start... as one of the other reviewers said, you know you\\'re in for a real treat when you see the opening shot - minutes and minutes of film time spent on a guy standing on a travelator. i won\\'t repeat rubin\\'s excellent summary of the story. what i would like to say, though, is that this film gripped me more than any film i can remember. i sat open-mouthed, and on the edge of my seat all the way through. the camera work, sound track and *fantastic* performances (particularly that of tony servillo) draw you to the screen and won\\'t let you look away. it\\'s italian, so of course everyone looks fantastic, but it is by no means merely an exercise in cool style. this is a film with lots to say about luck, loss and love. go and see it. begotten is one of the most unique films i\\'ve ever seen. it is more, to me, a study of sound, light and dark, and movement than a real story. the type of thing you see as a video instillation at the museum of modern art than a film enjoyed at the local theater. i\\'m not going to try to interpret the images of the mother nature, the beasts in cloaks, the twisted and tortured body of her \"child\". some things just defy interpretation. although this was a low budget film and clearly last minute, it holds a certain charm that is difficult to pinpoint. i tend to believe it is the scriptwriter- grant morris (see dead dog), who, despite the warped plot line injected a fantastic slice of humour, sorely missing in many of today\\'s box office hits. definitely a must see for a sunday afternoon laughfest. speaking as a true single girl, and very sceptical this film did not inspire me particularly, but did ignite a small flame of hope for a lovelife. not my lovelife, so much as my slightly crazy neighbour\\'s lovelife who lets her hamster sleep in her bed with her. she may find someone. darr is a great movie! shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to win over his lady which in this case is juhi chawla. little does juhi know in the film that shahrukh has a major crush on her and is constantly stalking her. i have to admit, some of the things he did in this movie were pretty creepy... like the threatening phone calls. never in my life will i forget the line, \"i love you k..k..k..kiran!\" it\\'s just too bad that shahrukh and juhi weren\\'t exactly \"together\" in the film. but juhi and sunny do make a fairly good couple in the movie. though shahrukh\\'s role was pretty psychotic, i still think he did a great job of playing it and can\\'t possibly imagine anyone else doing that role. no wonder he got an award for darr in 94\\'! juhi... what can i say??? she looks especially amazing in this film! it\\'s not that she doesn\\'t always look amazing in her other films, but darr did give the public a wonderful image of her! as for the music... it was excellent! especially \"jaadu teri nazar,\" one of my all time favorite songs. i also thought \"tu mere samne\" was quite nice also. a must see for everyone! overall darr deserves a 9/10! it would be a shame if tommy lee jones and robert duval ever see this movie as they will probably be associated with it in years to come. \"oh yeah\", the public will say, \"\\'comanche moon\\', that\\'s the mini series about the texas rangers and the comanche indians that starred tommy lee jones and robert duval. it was a real stinker and probably the worst movie they were ever in. i think it was a comedy but a not very funny comedy. i really don\\'t understand why they agreed to be in it\". that would be such an injustice as the original \"lonesome dove\" was a true western classic and this turkey is a real bomb and jones and duval will be remembered for it. i love this movie. the cast were all terrific in the portrayal of their various characters. judith ivey did so well portraying a weak, fearful, dependent, who was passive aggressive in her complaining and self-involved character, that it was a relief to see the character\\'s metamorphosis. blythe danner was equally appealing in her role as a somewhat judgmental jewish mother, devoted wife, and loving sister. jonathon silmerman, bob dishy, stacey glick, and lisa walz performed their roles equally well. if you enjoy movies that relate to going through challenging times without loosing your sense of humor and hope, you will love this movie. this is one of the unusual cases in which a movie and the novel on which it is based are both great. maybe this is because gorris\\' takes nabokov\\'s initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation. the final consequence is a point of view over luzhin which dignifies him more than the nabokov\\'s one. the only thing in the movie which i don\\'t like is the influence of valentinov\\'s on luzhin\\'s destiny. i can\\'t imagine nabokov creating a person like valentinov and giving him so great influence on novel\\'s argument. not to be confused with the resse witherspoon high school film of the same name, this is a stylised look at hong kong\\'s triad gangs. called election because a new leader or \\'chairman\\' is elected by ancient traditions every two years. two candidates are up for the position and through ego, bribes and past track record the race is tense to say the least. expertly directed to introduce you to an expansive cast without ever being confusing the story twists and turns before revealing itself in all its brutal glory. the asian godfather this is not, but it is an enjoyable thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wincing at the violence. subtitled volume 1 i think its safe to say there will other instalments as we go deeper into the murky world of the triads and all their feuding and underhand business deals. either way this is a good start and if there are no sequels a great film in its own right. a shirley temple short subject. it can get mighty rough at buttermilk pete\\'s cafe when the local contingency of diaper-clad war babies come in for their midday milk break. this primitive little film - a spoof of military movies - provides a few chuckles, but little else: tiny tots talking tough can begin to pall in a short time. shirley temple, playing a duplicitous hip-swinging french miss, hasn\\'t much to do in this pre-celebrity performance. highlight: the real signs of toddler temper when a few of the infants unexpectedly get well & truly soaked with milk. often overlooked or neglected today, the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents, both in front & behind the camera. the dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film, something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel. economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material, short subjects were the perfect complement to the studios\\' feature films. i liked this movie a lot. it really intrigued me how deanna and alicia became friends over such a tragedy. alicia was just a troubled soul and deanna was so happy just to see someone after being shot. my only complaint was that in the beginning it was kind of slow and it took awhile to get to the basis of things. other than that it was great. i felt obliged to watch this movie all the way through, since i had found it in a bargain bin and bought it for my own, but i came close many times to turning it off and just writing off the money i had paid for it. if you are a fan of gore and sadism, this movie is ok. if there is one thing that the makers of this film know, it is the creative use of fake blood and body parts for a sickening effect. if that doesn\\'t thrill you, then stay away. this movie is shot on a home video camera, with grade school props and terrible actors. it\\'s dubbed from german, but even allowing for that, the sound is awful. this film is about as budget as budget gets, except for the aforementioned special effects. if they had spent a little more money on actors and a real script instead of blood and guts, the film might have been a little more enjoyable. the story is about three men that land on an island inhabited by an army of tin-masked sadists. they are captured, and the rest of the movie is about their attempt to escape. i call this a story in the loosest sense, since it is really a series of scenes of torture and combat strung together by inane obscenity-filled dialog. there is nothing whatsoever redeeming about this movie, unless you like mindless gore. consider yourself warned. it\\'s pretty evident that many of your nights were spent alone. if you watched 5 minutes of the actual show instead of watching the commercial you would have seen one of the greatest television shows in canadian history being made. too bad you would have been watching it alone. probably the reason you hate it... no game. keys to the vip is hilarious, light and funny. guys are going to eat this show up. my game is tight and i can hardly wait to get on this show. the chicks were hooooot and the clubs kicked ass. i\\'ll be watching every week. it makes me wonder why more great shows like this one aren\\'t being made. now it\\'s clear that the talent in canada has the ability to produce american quality television. george saunders is a forger who steals a rare copy of hamlet, killing a guard in the process. months later an associate of his is selling forgeries of the book for great sums of money. one of the forgeries is sold to a man working for the nazi\\'s. not happy at being taken the nazi front man insists on getting his money back, at the same time an investigator working for one of the other swindled clients shows up. the middle woman in an effort to keep herself safe begins to play all sides against each other and sets up a meeting at the new york public library between various parties, however as people begin to die, the library is locked down and more murders (and perhaps some rare book larceny) seem to be close to happening. complex murder mystery is a good little thriller with a great cast (saunders is joined by richard denning and a cast of solid supporting players) if there is a flaw the film is almost too complicated with plots with in plots and everyone pretty much out for themselves. the layers of theft, forgery, murder and war time intrigue (this was 1942) are almost too many for the brief 70 minute running time. still its an enjoyable little film with a darkness and sense of inescapable doom for some of the characters that clearly marks this as one of the first film noirs. until denning shows up we\\'re down among some charming thieves, whom we like, perhaps even more than the hero, but its clear from word and deed this is not going to have a completely happy ending, and they know it, even if they fight it. a good little film that\\'s worth searching out. this is a movie about a black man buying a airline company and turning the company into a african-centric over the top airliner. they even portray the owner as not only being in control of the airline, but also controlling part of the air terminal at the airport. one day this guy wins $100 million dollars a the next time you see him, he is walking all over the airport acting like the owner of the airport. everyone calls this movie a parody, but nothing about this movie shouts parody! this movie is a flop and will forever be in the $4.95 bin at wal-mart. i can\\'t even come to terms to why mgm would waste 16 million dollars on this movie. this movie doesn\\'t even warrant straight-to-video status. the writers (one black and one white) should be blackballed from hollywood forever. not only do they over-stereotype blacks, they portray them as ignorant human beings. i would be ashamed of going to a movie that constantly humiliates me. don\\'t waste your time at the video store, wal-mart, pay-per-view, or on a sunday afternoon when the movie is shown on tbs. i\\'ve noticed how all the other reviews of this film mention how \"wholesome\" and \"entertaining\" it is. these people need to get out of the house more often. i don\\'t know why they\\'re shilling for this vapid, insipid, brainless piece of fluff. pat boone has absolutely no acting talent whatsoever, and his ineptness is exceeded only by that of his co-star pamela austin, a former model (yet one more reason to outlaw the insidious practice of inflicting talentless models on an unsuspecting moveiegoing public, a foul habit that unfortunately persists to this day). a good supporting cast (terry-thomas, edward everett hortyon, among others) tries hard to make some sense out of this, but to no avail. i noticed that two directors shared credit, although \"credit\" isn\\'t the word i would use (neither is \"director\"). as for \"wholesome entertainment,\" there are plenty of those types of movies available without torturing your loved ones by forcing them to sit through this. find one of those films, and skip this one. this movie was an excellent acted, excellent directed and overall had an excellent story. ive had real life experiance with a boy like \\'radio\\'. at the football program in my town, weve had a mentally challenged boy every year practice, travel, and have fun with the football team. this movie is really true and i can identify with it 100%. a boy like \\'radio\\' just needs to feel like they belong to something; they need to feel like their life is worth living. thats how \\'radio\\' feels and thats why that type of program is set up at my high school. this is a very touching movie that im glad has been brought to the big screen. my dad and i loved it and i will always remember this for being a movie that tells a riveting story of the goodness and kindness of man! cheap, amateurish, unimaginative, exploitative... but don\\'t think it\\'ll have redeeming amusement value. about as unentertaining, uninstructive and just plain dull as a film can be. the cars in this movie are awesome. the acting in this movie is awful. the plot and driving scenes don\\'t make much sense and are equally bad. if you get really bothered by movies where someone shifts and suddenly goes ridiculously faster, save yourself the trouble and money. good movie for racing fans? well, there is a part where they make the mistake of referring to a nascar driver as a rally car driver. if you can\\'t tell the difference, go watch it, you\\'ll have a blast. it really comes down to this, there are really really really nice cars in this movie, they are driven horribly and are completely unrealistic. the acting is horrible mainly because of the extremely bad plot. if you want to see hot girls, turn on mtv or vh1 instead. i am disappointed that such nice cars would be represented in such a bad movie. if the class of the cars were to match that of the movie, they should be racing with rusted bicycles. who doesn\\'t have unresolved issues with parents? and which parents don\\'t have unresolved issues with each other? i know, that sounds heavy. but this is played for laughs in the movie, making both the comedy better and the drama better. i\\'ve always like paul reiser and peter falk, and although i was a bit concerned that their star qualities might be too big for a small movie, i was enchanted from the very first scene. especially entertaining were the discoveries that the son makes about his father as a person. and peter falk\\'s monologue about being a hard-working, sacrificing father and husband was the perfect balancing point. without that scene being acted so well, the movie would have seemed far less nuanced, and the character far less interesting. nicely done, paul and peter! good animation, nice character design, and a light-hearted story make suzumiya haruhi no yuutsu enjoyable to watch. after my first viewing, i thought that this anime was pretty good, but but was much better on for a second watch. this is because it is done out of chronological order, and once you re watch it in correct order you notice connections you didn\\'t see before. (or it may be that you see a second meaning to some events you didn\\'t notice before) you may want to read the original novels (not manga) by tanigawa nagaru before/after seeing this. the anime is very good at visualizing every detail in the stories it shows. however, there are some short stories from the book that are not animated, but are referenced to.(bamboo w/ wishes attached shown in episode 14) overall, this anime is actually very good once after brief analyzation of the plot (reading the book improves upon it as well). it is a nice break from the shounen-jump anime that seem to be taking over. a film like crossfire puts another film that spreads around its social consciousness- i.e. the recent film crash- almost to shame. not necessarily because either one puts forth its message of intolerance-is-rotten more significantly (although i\\'d wager crash throws the hammer down much more thickly in comparison with this), but because of how the storytelling and contrivances never get much in the way like with crash. maybe it\\'s not really necessary to compare the two, as crossfire is in its core all deep into the film-noir vein like its going out of style. it was interesting actually to see what the director edward dmytryk said on the dvd interview, where he mentioned that the budget for the photography was significantly lower (on purpose) so that more could be spent on the actors, and the schedule went through at a very brisk, quick pace. but then what comes off then as being incredible about the picture is that you would think looking at many of the lighting set-ups that it took a lot to do. just for a small scene, like when robert mitchum\\'s keeely first goes in for questioning under the captain robert young- the contrasts of shadows seamlessly in the room is exquisite. that there are many other lighting set-ups that go even further with so little marks this as something essential in the realm of just the look of the noir period. just take a look at a shot of characters on a stairwell, the bars silhouetted against them, and see what i mean. but back to the substance part of the film- it\\'s really a story that consists of a murder mystery, but one that we as the audience don\\'t take long to figure on the answer. it\\'s then more about something else then in the mind and soul of a killer that wouldn\\'t be found in a common crime picture then, as there are really no \\'criminals\\' for the most part in the film. there\\'s a very calculated risk with this then that characters could be too thin just to prop up the (worthwhile) message against anti-semitism. but dmytryk\\'s direction of his top-shelf cast, along with a really terrific script by john paxton fleshes out the characters, least of which for what they should have to not seem too thin alongside the message. and what would a noir be then without some attitude to go along with it? mitchum helps that along, even in scenes like between him and young where its very much based in the situation of the story\\'s moment (i.e. a detail in the plot), by injecting a little sly wit into some of the dialog. it may already be there in the lines, but he helps make the character with a good edge for his scenes. then there\\'s also robert ryan, who excels at montgomery as a man who you know you don\\'t like much at first, just through his b.s. demeanor, but you\\'re not totally sure about either. then once it starts to come clearer- ironically through a subjective view-point of the suspect mitchell (george cooper) at the apartment of the soon-to-be-deceased samuels- his performance becomes a great balancing act of being full of crap and also rather frightening in his blind-way. it\\'s a good performance when also countered with cooper, who has actual personal issues that he faces and comes forward with regret and humility. it\\'s really after the film ends that one thinks about a lot of this, however, and while you\\'re watching the film it\\'s more about getting into the dialog and the flow of the scenes, and in the sometimes stark, overpowering camera moves on the actors, so the message is in a way secondary. not that it isn\\'t an important one, especially for the time period (coming right off of ww2), but years later its seeing the actors, even the ones that don\\'t get the big marquee status like gloria grahame as ginny (the femme fatale of the picture, if it could\\'ve had time for one which it doesn\\'t) and william phipps as leroy (the \"hick\"), working off one another that sticks much strongly in the compacted screenplay. dmytryk is also very wise in choosing to limit the musical score is powerful too, as for very long stretches we hear nothing, and mostly when it does come up it\\'s incidental to the character\\'s surroundings. he could\\'ve just as easily gone with added musical notes on some dramatic scenes for emphasis, most specifically the opening audience-grabber into the film. by sticking clear of that, and getting the right attitudes and nuance in camera and cast, it uplifts standards in genre material to a very fine, memorable level. my favorite scene would probably go to finley\\'s story about an irish immigrant he tells to leroy, where all such elements come into place well. it might not come in very high at the top of my favorite noirs- and i\\'d still throw-down murder my sweet as the director\\'s masterpiece in this kind of picture- but it\\'s assuredly higher in quality than something of the b-level too. warning spoilers following. superb recreation of the base in antarctica where the real events of the film took place. other than that, libelous!, scandalous! filmed in canada; presumably by a largely canadian crew and cast. i caught the last half of this film recently on global television here in canada. nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled i was at what a blatant piece of american historical revisionist propaganda it is; and starring susan sarandon of all people! i can only assume that canadian born director roger spottiswoode was coerced to make the usaf the heroes of the film when in fact the real rescuers where a small private airline based in calgary; kenn borek air. the club scenes in this film are extremely believable, tim curry is in his most venal mode, and there are enough drugs and violence here for two movies, maybe even three. what more do you require from an evening\\'s entertainment? pump up the volume. this movie makes me think the others i\\'ve seen with combs were an accident. the plot had more holes than i think i\\'ve ever seen in a movie purporting to be something more than a \"b\" movie. the acting was so laughable that not even the memories of combs\\' past campy triumphs were enough to save it. considering the script i have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas. i am thoroughly upset that i paid blockbuster prices for this trash. the fact that it was made for television was something that would have helped me avoid this atrocity and frankly something that movies this poor should be required to warn you of. avoid this movie no matter what. i saw this film purely based on the fact that it was on the dpp video nasty list, and while i\\'m glad i saw it because it\\'s now \\'another video nasty down\\' - on its own merits, andy milligan\\'s film really isn\\'t worth bothering with. there are, of course, far worse films on the infamous list; but that doesn\\'t make the pain of viewing this one any easier. the film was obviously shot on an extremely low budget, and that has translated into the script; as blood rites works on an idea often seen in horror cinema, and doesn\\'t do anything new with it. basically, the plot centres on three couples who find themselves at a house awaiting the results of a will. it\\'s not long before they start getting picked off...blah blah blah. for most of the film, nothing happens; and then when we finally get down to the scenes that justify the movie being banned, they\\'re so amateurish and silly that they\\'re impossible to take seriously on any level. it\\'s a very good thing that this movie doesn\\'t have a very long running time as otherwise it could have been used as a particularly nasty method of torture. it all boils down to a fittingly tedious ending, which also succeeds in being a non-event of epic proportions. apparently, this movie is still banned here in the uk; but somehow i doubt it\\'s because of its shock value. basically, blood rites isn\\'t worth seeing and i personally can see no reason to recommend it. unless, of course, you\\'ve made it your business to see everything on the video nasty list... 15 park avenue, well the name mystifies initially being an address from new york and film being set in kolkata. however as the story unfolds, one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between relationships, social cause and of course the world of schizophrenia. i would say aparna sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal. well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie. in a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own \\'15 park avenue\\'. its an unending search within each of one of us... the powerhouse performance from shabana azmi is a treat to watch. her screen presence brings whole lot of life into the scene. indeed it was surprising to see her in such a powerful act after long because i expected it to be all the way konkona sen\\'s terrain. shabana makes you feel skin deep of an elder sister who is running the whole show for a rather unfortunate family and during this time she almost forgets to live her own life. she burdens all her ambitions and desires with ailing 18 year younger sister ( who is more like a daughter to her ) and an aging mother played by veteran waheeda rehman. as for the leading actress from guide ( that\\'s how i can recall her instantly ) there is hardly anything to say except few lines and tear drops here and there. ever dependable rahul bose plays another pivotal role in the film, he shows the emotions of a middle age man with repent on his face to near perfection. this man really amazes me with the variety of work he has done. from a musician in jhankar beats to a liberal muslim in mr. & mrs. iyer and so many othersâ…. he is one versatile i really wish if he had some more shots in the first part of the movie as well. the cameo in the movie is by shefali shah (remember satya and monsoon wedding). she looks really beautiful and depicts the role of a mother of 2 kids with real ease. she gives you a glimpse of today\\'s indian woman who is modern in approach but still conventional when it comes to her husband\\'s prior relationships. the focus of camera has been meethi, portrayed by konkona. she and her schizophrenic world constitute the nucleus of 15 park avenue. she has really worked hard for the character but there are times when she is not able to relate with the audience. the fateful accident of her life tries to rope in sympathy and it has been only partially successful. the movie tries to address quite a few things in one go starting from the unique world of a disabled person to the unequal status of a female even in today\\'s modern india and also the twisted relationships in a tattered family. and i believe aparna has succeeded to certain extent. the helplessness of meethi while she works as a journalist in a rural eastern state really gives us all a naked picture of the country we are so proud of. well after i finished 15 park avenue, there was a sense of unquenched thirst within me. i wanted more out of this movie to drench me emotionally. it has been a commendable effort on the part of director except few hiccups. must watch for all those who like to see a different cinema, something with a strong purpose. i was stan in the movie \"dreams come true\". stan was the friend that worked at the factory with the main character and ended getting his arm smashed in the machinery and got carried out screaming (where was the ambulance?) the acting in this movie was for the most part pretty poor with mostly local actors from the fox valley, wisconsin. i saw the movie on the big screen. it played 2 nights in 3 theaters and was something special to see yourself on the big screen. i may be bias, but overall, i enjoyed it. also the soundtrack was the band spooner, who later became garbage. my brother, steve charlton was also in the movie. he played swenson the man who comes to the door on crutches to talk with the police. the movie starts good, it has a thing going for it. about 1/3 into the movie things go downhill. carrey starts obsessing about the number 23 because he sees it everywhere. so what? thats no reason to go nuts and start writing stuff all over your body and on walls. the acting by whoever is playing his son is bad. from the get-go, as soon as he hears of his fathers obsession, he jumps on the bandwagon and is hysterical about it. totally unbelievable. i hope i never see this kid in another movie again. its a waste of time watching this movie. grab another. boring piece of ... well. the number is killing him? give me a break. i won\\'t spoil the ending for you, but let\\'s just say it is equally disappointing. 3 / 10. lion king 1 1/2 is a very fun and addictive sequel. don\\'t expect the production values of a theatrical release, but do expect the highest quality of direct to video release. it is set up as timon & pumba begin watching the original lion king in a darkened theater and abruptly switch tracks and begin narrating their own story. this is done with frequent comedic interruptions. for example, during one particular tense moment a home shopping commercial pops on and a chagrined pumba realizes he has sat on the remote. these little moments pepper the movie, and whether you find them entertaining or not will greatly depend on your sense of humor. if you are particularly bothered by movies that deliberately remind the viewer is watching a movie, than this may not be your cup of tea. animation is the best they\\'ve invested in the disney dtv line, and is integrated almost seamlessly with the original material. the newer, independent material uses a lot of the artistic style of the original. the voice talents are all well performed, though i couldn\\'t help thinking of marge simpson every time i heard julie kavner. many of the jokes in the movie will be well recognized by viewers as recycled over the generations, but are presented more with the familiarity of comfortable quirks of old friends than annoyingly repetitive. the music has made me realize how much i enjoyed and miss a good musical integrated with a disney feature. the toe-tapping opening feature of \\'dig a tunnel\\' is well choreographed and hilarious. timon and pumba\\'s take on the lion king\\'s opening sequence and their introduction to paradise are also amusing. the only problem was the reprise of the \\'dig a tunnel\\' at the end of the movie, switching its lyrics and tune from defeatist to uplifting. story line is pretty well done, and the integration of new plot elements is done almost perfectly, though the final bit during the hyena chased stretched the storyline credibility a little. the new story doesn\\'t seem to handle saccharine or emotionally charged moments to well, and does better when it is resorting to full comedy. overall, worth purchasing. if you like all the bonus features that come with a typical 2-disc set, then go for it. for the penny pincher who still is willing to invest on a good flick, wait until it drops four or more dollars and go rent it right away. damion crowley. when this was released, i thought this was one of the most profane films ever made. however, thanks to martin scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him, there have been mainline films worse, language-wise, than this....but this is a pretty brutal assault on one\\'s ears. hey, i can take a lot of it, but this got ridiculous. in the first six minutes alone, i heard a half-dozen usage\\'s of the lord\\'s name in vain plus an untold number of f-words. i wonder how many people walked out of the theater watching this in 1990? i couldn\\'t have been the only one. not surprisingly, some of the feature actors included jennifer jason-leigh, burt young, jerry orbach and rikki lake. since this film, stephen lang seems to have improved his image, at least playing the godly \"stonewall\" jackson in \"gods and generals.\" lang\\'s role here is just the opposite: perhaps the worst trashy person in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite by the end of the film. depressing, gloomy, semi-pornographic, repulsive: these are just a few of the adjectives people used - even some liberal critics - in describing this story, which is painted even worse in the novel. of course, some of the better-known critics, all extreme libs, praised the movie. however, they were the only ones. most critics were disgusted, as well almost all of the paying public. it\\'s unbelievable that anyone could praise filth and garbage like this. trust me on this: there are no good, likable characters in this entire movie. this is a mean, sick film: one of the worst of the \"modern era.\" that is, unless you enjoy seeing child abuse, drug abuse, teen prostitutes, on and on - two straight hours of nothing but atrocities and just plain evil people. no thanks. i\\'d give this film a 1/10. this film is devoid of common cinematic substance and concentrates way too much upon the current \"skin trend\" in bollywood movies. i\\'d definitely not recommend teenagers to watch this movie. what really makes me feel dejected is how could such an impressive banner like yash chopra films ever succumb to such an awful production? they have perhaps forgotten to keep in view that there is a larger audience than \"adult\" audience too, which when exposed to these sort of gross movies,may wreck their growing mind set and succumb to things devoid of sense and recognition. on the whole, films must not only be entertaining, but also must comprise of some sense as well. certainly, this film is an immense disappointment to yash chopra fans, especially me myself. i am really disappointed over the plot, acting and everything else. why can\\'t people put in some substance that can be cherished after confronted with in the films, at least for once throughout the film? the point is clear. i\\'d like to put my opinion in short: \"horrible - disappointment - lot of adult material - lack of sensible \"substance\" - lack of normal psyche - worthless - could grab a cornetto or a temptations chocolate instead\" i was so surprised when i saw this film so much underrated... i understand why some of you dislike this movie. its pace is slow, a characteristic of japanese films. nevertheless, if you are absorbed in the film like me, you will find this not a problem at all. i must say this is the best comedy i have ever seen. \"shall we dansu?\" is often considered a masterpiece of japanese comedies. it is very different from hollywood ones, e.g. austin powers or scary movies, in which a gag is guaranteed in every couple of minutes. rather, it is light-hearted, a movie that makes you feel good. i love the movie because it makes me feel \"real\". the plot is straightforward yet pleasing. i was so delighted seeing that sugiyama (the main role) has found the meaning of life in dancing. before i watched the film i was slightly depressed due to heavy schoolwork. i felt lost. however, this film made me think of the bright side of life. i believed i was in the same boat of sugiyama; if he could find himself in his hobby, why couldn\\'t i? it reminded me of \"exploring my own future\" and discovering the happiness in my daily life. it is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers. while some of you may find the dancing scenes not as perfect as you expect, i kinda like it as it makes me feel that the characters are really \"alive\", learning to dance as the film goes on. over all, this film is encouraging and heart-warming. as a comedy, it does its job perfectly. it definitely deserves 10 stars. and yes aoki is funny :-d i was greatly disappointed by the quality of this documentary. the content is poorly produced, very poor quality video and, especially awful audio. there\\'s extremely little about how bruce haack produced his music and virtually no examples of direct connection to later and contemporary electronic music. the interviews of people who knew bruce haack are ad-hoc mostly inarticulate mumbo-jumbo. too much yak and not enough haack. although i have a serious personal interest in electronic music and have a higher than average attention span, even for slow and/or difficult subject matter, i fell asleep while watching this documentary and had to review it to see the parts i slept through. if you watch this, make sure that you are set up, before viewing, like alex in a clockwork orange. bruce haack deserves much better than this. shame on the producer and director. i\\'ve tried to reconcile why so many bad reviews of this film, while the vast majority of reviews are given a rating of between 7 and 10. the reason may be this film is kind of hard to describe in a positive review, although a few have done that quite nicely already. this film is confusing, depressing, and doesn\\'t have a happy ending. i still gave pola x a rating of 10, because it is basically for me literature and art combined on film. that is really my favorite kind of filmmaking. i\\'ve only seen two of carax\\'s films: this one and mauvis sang. as with this film, i\\'m being somewhat pretentious when i call this one of carax\\'s best films- but i am. carax has a minimalist style. if that type of film does not appeal to you and is boring, then it would be best not to watch this. but pola x was less minimalist than mauvis sang, so it had quite a lot of intensity for a thriller- at least for my taste. i found it quite interesting and absorbing. the two lead roles did an excellent job acting. (i mean the lead and the young woman he thought was his half sister.) catherine d. is always great, but her role was not very large or significant in the story. but everyone did a fine job. i thought the cult stuff was great. it may have not been very believable, but that is due to its being rather abstract. there is a lot going on between the lines in this film. this is a very freudian psycho-thriller. warning: spoiler,spoiler,spoiler!!!! this is written for filmgoers who may have walked away from \"mood for love\" perplexed and confused about paths the main characters choose in life. from reading other comments and reviews it seems that many viewers and critics missed some very important details which may have prevented them from enjoying this delightful tease of a movie. we are so use to seeing blatant sex in narrations that we forget that there was a time when filmakers would suggest the \"dirty deed\" by simply showing the slack-mouthed couples ride off in a sleigh or haywagon only to return into the next scene with a bulging gut or a fat toddler stuck to the hip...\"meet your child\". the director chose the same nostalgic approach in telling the story of mr chow and mrs chan. last warning...spoiler spoiler spoiler mr chow fools mrs chan into showing her real emotions when they rehearse his departure forever. next scene: mrs chan leans her head on mr chow in the taxi and says \"i do not want to go home tonight\". translation: \"let\\'s do it\" why then did the couple just not do the modern thing of dumping their cheating spouses,get a divorce,raise their love child and live happily ever after? the answer is that this whole story takes place in hong kong during the sixties. a bastard would live in a bleak life of shame if he were the child of an adulteress;whereas,a \"legitimate\" child could live a tragic but noble/honest life if his mother chose to raise him away from his cheating \"father\"-the invisible mr chan. in short,mr chow and mrs chan sacrifices their relationship for the future of their child. that is why mr chow,upon learning that mrs chan lives alone with a little boy gives a knowing smile and ends his dreams of making mrs chan his mrs chow. he then,also realizes why mrs chan went to all the way to singapore to be with him,only to reconsiders at the last momment and leave..,choosing to never see him again.(but not before taking some unnamed keepsake) mr chow lives with this wonderful secret with no one to tell. no one,except for a crumbling temple wall and of course we the viewer,...but only if we listen carefuly. this is a great film with an amazing cast. crispen glover is at his freakiest . his guitar solo is amazing. also watch out for a cameo by william burroughs. truly a cult classic. this is on my top ten list. don\\'t miss this twisted film. maya is a woman without any interests. she just dreams her life away and wonders, why she does not feel fulfilled. this could be an interesting topic. that would need a good story, a nice setting and good dialogues. it doesn\\'t have any of these. this movie is totally boring. there are only lengths and no climaxes.the only climax is shahrukh khan. but although i am a huge fan of his, i couldn\\'t stand this movie. even he can\\'t make this movie exiting. the movie is not as bad as \"king uncle\" and if you\\'re an art-house fan or like it slow, you might maybe like it. it\\'s not funny, it\\'s not interesting, it\\'s not catching. my recommendation: don\\'t watch it. this is a bad movie. not one of the funny bad ones either. this is a lousy bad one. it was actually painful to watch. the direction was awful,with lots of jumping around and the green and yellow hues used throughout the movie makes the characters look sickly. keira knightly was not convincing as a tough chick at all,and i cannot believe lucy liu and mickey rourke signed on for this criminal waste of celluloid. the script was terrible and the acting was like fingernails across a chalkboard. if you haven\\'t seen it,don\\'t. you are not missing anything and will only waste two hours of your life watching this drivel .i have seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them due to their faults. this one is just a waste of time. this is an excellent movie and i wish that they would put it out on dvd for people to purchase. it is difficult to try to catch it on tv all the time. as you do not know when one of the stations will decide to air it. can someone tell me what file company make it so i can write to them and see if they will release it to the public? i only caught the last hour and a half yesterday and i only got to see it once last year. my sisters and i are all looking for it in every store that sells any videos. john denver is an excellent singer and actor and the plot line is great. they put out some much older movies and i think that is great but there are quite a few that they have not put out and i think if we could contact the producers and voice our requests we might get some of them put out on dvd. this movie is simply not worth the time or money spent. full of clichã©s and a plot that makes absolutely no sense ! i cant believe that so many people have given this awful movie a 10. my guess is they are stooges of the movie maker. if i could give this movie a zero, i would. too bad imdb doesn\\'t allow that. the only reason i watched it because i went with a friend who really wanted to see it. whats sad is that i never had great expectations from this movie to begin with and yet i felt short changed. take my word, don\\'t waste your $8 on this piece of trash. the only entertainment i got out of the movie was making fun of the directors name. in all, highly not recommended ! putting aside the \"i\\'m so sure\"s and \"totally gnarly\"s this is one of the sweetest and lifelike romances portrayed on film. deborah foreman (where is she now?) as julie and nicolas cage as randy are as classic as romeo and juliet, tony and maria, jake and samantha... you can\\'t help but fall in love with them. plus the soundtrack - the plimsouls, sparks, the furs, the flirts, and of course, modern english - is also outstanding. for fans of films about young love, i\\'d equally recommend the recent film all the real girls by david gordon green. it started out with an interesting premise. i always like civil war stuff and ancient secret societies. the more the film progressed, the more i realized that this was a b movie at best. in the latter half, it quickly became a c movie, then d, then f, then \"i wish that this wasn\\'t a rental so that i could put it in the microwave!\" i can\\'t say that the acting in all cases was awful, just most. the writing, however... i never read the book. maybe the book is well written. the screenplay was written by a 10 year old. it was ridiculously shallow, the dialog drab and uninteresting, the characters about as interesting as a 5 pound bag of fertilizer. i really hated this movie, as did my wife. i am a christian and i have no problem with movies that promote or support christianity. this movie did a great disservice to the cause. awful, terrible, worthless. if you liked it, i strongly recommend superman 4. a film that is so much a 30\\'s warners film in an era when each studio had a particular look and style to their output, unlike today where simply getting audiences is the object. curitz was one of the quintessential warners house directors working with tight economy and great efficiency whilst creating quality, working methods that were very much the requirements of a director at warners, a studio that was one of the \"big five\" majors in this era producing quality films for their large chains of theatres. even though we have a setting of the upper classes on long island there is the generic warners style embedded here with a narrative that could have been \"torn from the headlines\". another example is the when the photographers comment on the girls legs early in the film and she comments that \"they\\'re not the trophies\" gives the film a more working mans, down to earth feel, for these were the audiences that warners were targeting in the great depression. (ironically columbia and universal were the two minors under these five majors until the 50\\'s when their involvement in television changed their fortunes - they would have made something like this very cheaply and without the polish and great talent) curtiz has created from an excellent script a film that moves along at a rapid pace whilst keeping the viewer with great camera angles and swift editing. thank heavens there is no soppy love interest sub-plot so the fun can just keep rolling along. i got this dvd well over 2 years ago and only decided to watch it yesterday. i don\\'t know why it took me so long as i do like the inspector gadget show and even the new gadget and the gadgetinis. while it may have a bright color pallet and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie, there are some old things missing that bog this gadget right down the toilet. first of all the classic inspector gadget theme song and music is completely absent. the composer tries to compromise by doing a score that sounds similar but it\\'s still just no good enough. the gadget-mobile is now a talking car, not a car that can turn into a van. plus it looks a lot cuter and rounder instead of being plain cool. penny no longer has her computer book and she and brain hardly make an appearance at all. the plot is non-existent. there\\'s something about a transformation formula and doctor claw using for some never revealed evil but that\\'s all i got. what the deal was with the short/giant italian guy i will never know. it had nothing to do with anything. and if the title is anything to go by, his last case is wrapped up in no way whatsoever. and he stays on the force so why it\\'s called \\'last case\\' is a mystery also. i wasn\\'t impressed at all. this is an affront to a great animated show that is strangely absent on dvd, but don\\'t let that prompt you into buying whatever inspector gadget dvds you can. i sold this mere seconds after finally watching it. no kid will like or appreciate this and no fan of the old show with tolerate it. this episode of buffy was one of my personal favorites. also number three of joss\\' personal favorites as well. the episode featured very little dialogue and despite that the good folks at the emmy\\'s decided it merited a nomination. unfortunately it didn\\'t win. when hush first premiered it received about 6 million viewers, which was the highest rated episode of season four. that should tell you something. even though there was very little talking it managed to intrigue people enough to tune in. those gentlemen characters (who were played my mimes) were some of the scariest creatures the show has produced (or any network tv show i\\'ve seen). nothing is creepier then a bunch of silver teethed men coming at you with a scalpel while smiling away. i think that despite the lack of dialogue the actors did a fantastic job on the episode. bulletproof is quite clearly a disposable film. the kind where bullet riddled good guys and bad guys are splatted everywhere, so much so that you really aren\\'t supposed to see them as human. the yawns between the lines from wayans and sandler are extensive indeed. they try hard but , alas and alack, persona itself does not a good film make. jimmy caan plays a nifty villain but he\\'s always had that redneck edge at the ready. my favorite\\'s scene is the repeated clips of a tv ad in which caan reveals the virtues of america can be shown to the world by having 2 cars in every garage. aside from that it\\'s a buddy movie with guns for brains. pass on this one. i think this movie was made as good as it could have been. with only 4 months and a 52000$ budget - i\\'m surprised this wasn\\'t worse. if you are not to care about the cg or special effects, this movie is great. okay, the movie is not that well made (i\\'m sure it could have been but, you try to do better in only 4 months) but the story is good and the movie is rather exciting. don\\'t trust me when i say that this movie is good, cause i also find the 1933 king kong to be good. i must confess that i didn\\'t watch the complete movie either... i might have fast forwarded some minutes here and there... i gave this 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned. from the domestic violence, to sexuality and many of the taboos therein. outside of the gore i really would not call this horror so much as i would science fiction. it\\'s bleak, depressing and hopeless. while i don\\'t mind a less than cheery ending, i\\'m really very tired of the \"humans suck\" clichã© that\\'s central to every movie. i know you can\\'t get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of self-hatred as a member of the human race, but how\\'s \\'bout as a writer/director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the aliens killing the human race are evil! right now, if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die, just go out, find a lake and swim \\'til your arms are tired. this way you won\\'t be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me i deserve to die for being alive. it\\'s silly, not thoughtful, and boring. one of my all time favourite films, ever. just beautiful, full of human emotion, wit, humour, intelligence. the story grows, as does the lesson of life, just a wonderful film in so many ways. the cast are also fantasic..... a great selection of the finest british talent around. i loved them all for every diverse element brought into the film. italy has to be one of the most romantic places to form a story such as this, - everything about this film works. i love it :) this is a really mediocre film in the vein of \"buckaroo banzai.\" the cast runs around like \"mad max\" wannabes, and they seem to be sharing a joke that they do not want to share with the audience. wheeler-nicholson is one of the those guilty pleasure actresses you are delighted to stumble across in films, but she isn\\'t worth the price of rental. space maggot starts an electrical fire, and burns a vote of 4. being a high school student,i have to take a health class. this year, the topic is drugs. we learn about the harm they can cause a person. from what we talk about, i still believe and know that drugs can really mess a person up. anyway, my teacher wanted us to watch this. naturally, we groan and start to sleep, but like the rest of my class, i actually did enjoy this movie. it was totally real, and not sugar coated at all. the characters were amazing and believable. even the plot was outstandingly realistic and believable. what i liked about this movie mainly was how it got the point of the effect\\'s drugs can take on an abuser, and the consequences the person has to deal with. everyone reassures themselves that nothing bad will happen to them. well lets get serious. anything can happen in a small town, even to your best friend, like sam and chris. this movie shows it. a person can really learn a lot from watching this. it was pretty effective. this movie is good for entertainment purposes, but it is not historically reliable. if you are looking for a movie and thinking to yourself `oh i want to learn more about custer\\'s life and his last stand\\', do not rent `they died with their boots on\\'. but, if you would like to watch a movie for the enjoyment of an older western film, with a little bit of romance and just for a good story, this is a fun movie to watch. the story starts out with custer\\'s (errol flynn) first day at west point. everyone loves his charming personality which allows him to get away with most everything. the movie follows his career from west point and his many battles, including his battle in the civil war. the movie ends with his last stand at little big horn. in between the battle scenes, he finds love and marriage with libby (olivia de havilland). errol flynn portrays the arrogant, but suave george armstrong custer well. olivia de havilland plays the cute, sweet libby very well, especially in the flirting scene that custer and libby first meet. their chemistry on screen made you believe in their romance. the acting in general was impressive, especially the comedic role ( although stereotypical) of callie played by hattie mcdaniel. her character will definitely make you laugh. the heroic war music brought out the excitement of the battle scenes. the beautiful costumes set the tone of the era. the script, at times, was corny, although the movie was still enjoyable to watch. the director\\'s portrayal of custer was as a hero and history shows this is debatable. some will watch this movie and see custer as a hero. others will watch this movie and learn hate him. i give it a thumbs up for this 1942 western film. this movie has made me upset! when i think of cat in the hat. im thinking of cat in the hat books. you know, the one from a few years back that parents read to thier children. well, i though that this movie would be a lot like that! but much to my suprise was nothing like the books! insted it is more like young adult humor movie. in one part cat is talking to a gardening tool (hoe) cat talks to it like it is his hoe (agin adult humor). the naming of his car i all so though was a little untastful for a kids movie. under the rating you\\'ll find: mild cude humor and some double-entendres. i think in short this means adult humor. i wish i could return this movie! wal-mart said they wouldn\\'t because the movie has been opened. if you are thinking about buying this i suggest that maybe rent before you buy. mickey rourke hunts diane lane in elmore leonard\\'s killshot it is not like mickey rourke ever really disappeared. he has had a steady string of appearances before he burst back on the scene. he was memorable in: domino, sin city, man on fire, once upon a time in mexico, and get carter. but in his powerful dramatic performance in the wrestler (2008), we see a full blown presentation of the character only hinted at in get carter. whenever we get to know him, rourke remains a cool, but sleazy, muscle bound slim ball. this is an elmore leonard story, and production. leonard wrote such notable movies as taunt western thriller 3:10 to yuma, be cool, jackie brown, get shorty, 52 pick-up, and joe kidd. this means that we get tough guys, some good, some not so good. it also means we get tight, realistic plots with characters doing what is best for them in each situation, weaving complications into violent conclusions. killshot is no different. tough, slim ball killer rourke stalks unhappily married witness lane. think history of violence meets no country for old men. it is not as intense, bloody or gory as those two, but it is almost as good. if you like those two, including david croneberg\\'s equally wonderful eastern promises, you will like killshot also. director john madden has not done a lot of movies. his last few were enjoyable, if not successful: proof, captain corelli\\'s mandolin and shakespeare in love. diana lane hasn\\'t had a powerful movie role since she and richard gere gave incredible performances in unfaithful. lately she is charming and appealing in romantic stories such as nights in rodanthe, must love dogs, and under the tuscan sun. here she is right on mark, balancing her sexy appeal with reserved tension. this is a small part for rosario dawson. yet dawson does a good job with it. you see a lot more of lane, including an underwear scene to rival sigourney weaver in aliens and nicole kidman in eyes wide shut. while you are in the crime drama section, also pick up kiss, kiss, bang, bang, and gone baby gone, and before the devil knows your dead. the last has wonderful performances by phillip seymour hoffman, ethan hawke, marisa tomei and albert finney. killshot flopped at the box office. more is our luck. it is certainly worth a 3-4 dollar rental, if you like this genre. 6/20/2009 \"mã¼llers bã¼ro\" is a movie which many will watch and enjoy until the end, while others will stop watching it within five minutes. it is a parody of detective movies with all the twists and turns; the action takes place only at night in the dark corners of a city which resembles batman\\'s gotham city (look carefully at the streets, buildings, the police car chasing the criminals, etc.). it is also a parody of musicals with its really funny characters such as mã¼ller\\'s secretary and vitasek\\'s (the actor playing mã¼ller\\'s assistant) lover who do their best to sing, albeit not very successfully. the spaces occupied by the characters have their own presence in the film such as the decadent blue box (there is a real club with this name in vienna) where one can see a sailor hitting on a girl in the background, mã¼ller\\'s apartment with the black paint smeared on the walls and the dirty kitchen, mã¼ller\\'s bureau with the sweet picture of his assistant, etc. the humorous moments in the movie are many and include \"flat in the face\" type of humor such as mã¼ller farting in his assistant\\'s face, the prostitute charging mã¼ller extra for orgasm, the ridiculous outfits of the female thugs of montana, etc. a legendary film from the 80\\'s especially for those interested in austrian or german-speaking cinema. peter sollett has created an endearing portrait about real people living in poverty in the lower east side of new york, or loisaida, as it\\'s known by the locals. mr. sollett\\'s heart is in the right place as he examines this dysfunctional family, that is typical of the different \\'inner cities\\' of the country. mr. sollett accentuates the positive in the story he presents. these are basically good kids, the children of parents that have left them and whose grandmother has taken under her wing. instead of presenting his characters as losers, mr. sollett shows a positive side they all have. these kids are not into drugs, or are stealing because they are poor. had this story been done by hollywood we would have seen a parade of stereotypes, instead of children that are struggling, but deep down inside, they are not defeated. victor rasuk, as victor vargas, was a revelation. he is a natural. so is july marte. her character shows us a no nonsense girl who will not be fooled or driven to do anything she doesn\\'t want to do. altagracia guzman, as the grandmother is excellent. she conveys her frustration at not being able to steer her grandchildren into the things she believes in and that are so important to her. all in all, this was an excellent picture thanks to peter sollett. the long list of \"big\" names in this flick (including the ubiquitous john mills) didn\\'t bowl me over to the extent that i couldn\\'t judge the film on its actual merits. it is full of stereotypes, caricatures, and standard, set scenes, from the humble air-ace hero to the loud-mouthed yank flyer. the music track was such that at one point, about an hour before the end, i thought the film was over: loud, rising crescendo, grand flourish and finish then silence, but then the movie continued! i found no real storyline, haphazard writing, but smartly-pressed uniforms and the pretty jean simmons (pre-nose job) with a rousing little ditty. i cannot say that this picture has any of the ingredients which make a film great. i found it maudlin, mawkish and minor. i love the jurassic park movies, they are three of my all time favorite movies. and i hate this game, if there was one game i wish i never own for the super nintendo was this one. how can a game based on a classic movie be just too awful? and to make it worst, i was scare of this game when i was a kid. how dumb was that but then again i was a kid when this game was first out. the game play in this game is just odd. one minute it\\'s a action game and then it\\'s a shooter. what in the world is wrong with making up your mind when making a video game. the sound in the game is just terrible to listen. the music is just too sick to listen to. the controllers in the game don\\'t work most of the time. jurassic park the game is just a waste of time and money and won\\'t be a classic. avoid at all cost utterly useless... having been there, done that with the subject matter i have to say this captures the clubbing atmosphere in absolutely no respect. it may have done so had the characters not just been mouthpieces for incredibly dire, unrealistic drivel. so many cringe-worthy scenes that would put the office to shame (not a compliment to this film). it also may have helped to have some semblance of a story, a point, a message, a commentary, anything. seriously, kevin & perry go large had more to say on the subject than this film (term used very loosely in this case). there should be minus numbers reserved for films like this. -10 (extra turd) wild rebels is fun in a bad way, but also frustrating due to the actual good, or at least workable, elements in the story. it deals with a race car driver (steve alaimo) who gets mixed up in a group of bikers called satan\\'s angels, who hang around a lot until they decide to rob a bank. meanwhile alaimo also gets recruited by the cops to report back to them what the angels are up to and where they\\'ll rob next. it\\'s not even that the film is really too \\'dated\\', though it does of course carry the significantly crude and stupid music in the film (from the band on stage in one scene, to alaimo \"performing\" if you could call that drek that, to the regular generic score). it\\'s just that there\\'s not more care taken by the filmmaker into putting a little more logic, direction, and better actors for the parts. as it is i didn\\'t have a major disliking towards the film, as i did with the hellcats, but it almost left me a little indifferent to it all, too. what could come through as being unpredictable only comes through with stupid things like the name of the florida town (\\'citrusville\\' ho-ho). so it\\'s not completely un-worthy then of its mystery science theater 3000 status as of late. the commentary is good on the movie, even if once or twice i almost wanted to hear what the characters on screen were saying in case it might have some worth. wild rebels might be more of a good time if you\\'ve got a six-pack and low expectations, but as it is i wouldn\\'t watch it again. i`ve seen this movie twice, both times on cinemax. the first time in it`s unrated version which is soft-core porn at it`s best and the second time in a trimmed down (cut all the sex and most of the nudity out) version which was entertaining in a typical beach movie sort of way. the unrated version has a tremendous sex scene with nikki fritz, a dude and a bottle of oil which is out of this world (no pun intended). unfortunately, in the trimmed version that scene is almost completely chopped out, as are all the other sex scenes. rated or unrated it is still fun to watch all the siblings of bigger stars (stallone, sheen, travolta, etc;) trying to act. we also get appearances by b-queen linnea quigley and burt ward (robin from the old batman series). if this is someone\\'s \"favorite\" movie, they need some serious help. there is nothing funny or clever about this crapfest. i haven\\'t seen the original movie this is the remake of (some 1950s film), but it simply has to be better than this newer bastardization. a major gets kicked out of the military for being a fringe element, and winds up teaching children at an rotc school. unfortunately, the major is daman wayans... so the children are in for a world of annoying, humorless asininity. can wayans whip these losers into shape? can they get him to become a little more human? the film bombs as most wayans films do, with only a few sparkling moments. william hickey gets about one minute of screen time, fair too little. this charming old man (known best to me as a \"tales from the crypt\" actor, known best to you as uncle louis from \"christmas vacation\") shines every moment he\\'s on screen, which isn\\'t much here. bam bam bigelow also makes an appearance as a biker, which fits him perfectly. i wouldn\\'t mind slightly more bam bam, but i think he carried the role of \"biker\" about as far as it could be carried for a military film. and then there\\'s the attractive teacher, who someone falls for major payne even though he treats the kids poorly, has no social skills and is simply impossible to convert into someone you would want to spend time with. she must either be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate. i\\'m not sure which (though it would seem \"stupid\" since the movie makes it clear she gets out of the house often enough). wayans had one shining moment: a dance sequence where he performs a series of moves (including a very nice \"robot\"), and with the help of music from 2 live crew. this scene was enjoyable but hardly made up for anything else that made this film dog spittle. seriously, avoid this film. if you want to see a film a bout a loser who helps loser kids become heroes, rent or buy \"ernest goes to camp\". at least he\\'s a lovable loser, and actually funny. maybe if major payne had fought a badger i\\'d feel better, but he didn\\'t. forget payne, forget wayans... you can do so much better. i concur with the other users comment. hard to believe that this movie actually came out in 1994 because it screams mid 80\\'s. i think it is dubbed because the sound and the picture don\\'t always match up. if anyone can truly say this is a good movie, they need to be locked up. it is so sad how money has so much power over people that they will do anything to get it. i feel i lost intelligence from watching this. i used to have a little respect for chuck norris before i watched this but now i just feel bad. i bought this as part of a 3 movie pack for $9.99 and i can honestly say i would have been better off literally throwing the money away. forgive me jesus. i have just recently purchased collection one of this awesome series and even after just watching three episodes, i still am mesmerized by sleek styling of the animation and the slow, yet thoughtful actions of the story-telling. i am still a fan.....with some minor pains. though this installment into the gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series had-a stylish satiric way of telling about the wrongs of war and not letting go of the need to have control or power over everything(sound familiar?), i have to say that this one gets a bit too mellow-dramatic on continuing to explain the lives of the main characters and their incessant need to belly-ache about every thing that happens and what they need to do to stop the oz group from succeeding in their plans(especially the character called wufei...i mean he whines more than an american character on a soap opera. get a counselor,will ya?) besides for the over-exaggerated drama(i think that mostly comes from the dubbing of the english voice actors), this series is still very exciting and will still captivate me once again. i mean it can always be worse. it could be like the recent installment, seed......eeeewwww, talk about mellow-dramatic....i\\'ll chat about that one later. i\\'ve seen my share of woody allen\\'s movies, and while they\\'re not always great, you can usually be sure you\\'re going to be entertained. probably the last really good ones were bullets over broadway (\\'94) and mighty aphrodite (\\'95) - since then the ones i\\'ve seen have been patchy but watchable. and so when i was invited to see the new woody allen movie melinda and melinda, which i wasn\\'t even aware had been released yet, i went along happily. i hadn\\'t really heard much about it so i hoped i would be pleasantly surprised. what i got was definitely the worst woody allen movie i\\'ve seen. the premise is over-explained, the cast is terrible, the script is slow and lifeless. too many scenes said nothing and yet were stretched out, i assume to fill out what would have otherwise become a 15 minute short film. i don\\'t mind the concept behind this film - two directors discuss how a simple situation could be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy, and obviously the film proceeds to show us that, by playing out both scenarios. the problem is neither of these \\'two films\\' are any good at all. the comedy isn\\'t funny and the tragedy isn\\'t very tragic. it seems like allen came up with a good idea but then ran out of steam, or time, to actually complete the film. the general level of acting is notably bad also - will ferrell is the only one who brings anything to the table, and it\\'s basically a woody allen impression. previously good actors like chloe sevigny just come off as annoying, and the worst of the bunch is radha mitchell as melinda (which is a shame, because her character is in nearly every scene!). to be fair to the actors, the script they are working with is lacking if not non-existent. definitely a long way from the allen we know and love from classics like manhattan or annie hall. although the premise of the movie involves a major \"coincidence,\" the actors all do a creditable job and look great bringing the story to life. i found myself rooting for the characters played by mary tyler moore and christine lahti, empathizing with both, and wanting them to reconcile. sam waterston and ted danson are fine in their roles as well, doing a decent job with the stereotypical buddy relationship. while the story tends to leap through time, occasionally leaving the audience perhaps a little hungry for missing detail, it still flows and avoids any real confusion. this interesting storyline has all the elements for a good \"chick flick.\" i saw this movie, and the play, and i have to add that this was the most touching story that i had ever seen. until i saw this movie i was unaware of how awful life was and probably still is for the south african children and adults that were and are living in that era. it brought tears to my eyes and much sadness to my heart that any human being should have to struggle like that just to stay alive, and to bring the children right out of that area and teach them to act and preform and turn them loose to tell their own story is simply amazing. this simply surpass a five star, i rate it a ten. thank you mr. mbongeni ngema for such a astonishing story. although it has been 12 years since this story has been told, it is still one that lays heavy in my heart.if there is a vhs, or dvd out there on the play, please notify me asap.thank you. ps there was nothing wrong with the kids wanting to bring awareness of their problems and conditions to the attention of other countries in hopes that some one would have a heart and offer assistance. and nothing wrong in that! heartily endorse the comments of boblipton and snow leopard. i\\'m thrilled to find this movie is available on us dvd - i\\'ve only ever seen it through once - i persuaded the goethe institute here in london to show it in their conrad veidt season some years ago - and long to see it again. barrymore is resplendent when engaged, as in this movie, possibly because of the prick of having a renowned german actor as a foil. and veidt is such a wonderful scene stealer (doesn\\'t he pick his nose at one point?) this is one of the seminal films to connect \\'dr jekyll\\' with \\'20th century\\', \\'grand hotel\\' or \\'midnight\\'; and \\'the cabinet of dr caligari\\' or \\'the student of prague\\' with \\'the spy in bladk\\', \\'contraband\\' and \\'casablanca\\'. see it! i\\'ve seen this amusing little \\'brit flick\\'many times. the only problem is its currently unavailable on video or dvd. i\\'ts certainly a contender for a dvd release. the much missed richard jordan plays \\'pinky\\' an ex-pat american, whose just been released from prison,he finds himself a job as an electrician in a bank, it all goes well until he finds himself embroiled in a bank heist with his ex cronies, david niven plays the mastermind ivan, its an enjoyable little romp, hopefully studio canal or anchor bay, will come to the rescue. look out for john rhys davies before he struck it big with \\'shogun\\' raiders of the lost ark \\'lord of the rings\\' in a small role as a barrister, i\\'m not sure this film could ever match the first one, even if it starred the original seven (notwithstanding the fact that four were killed). it just doesn\\'t have the spark and chemistry. all the actors seem tired and look as if they are just going through the motions to get their paychecks. it\\'s interesting how yul brynner is \"magnificent\" in the original film but stiff and unconvincing in this sequel. yet when he stars in westworld and futureworld in the 1970s his character (in the same matching black pants, shirt and hat) evokes the same mystery and presence of the 1960 film\\'s chris adams. there\\'s nothing in this 1966 flick to make it worth watching, even on cable. beautiful film, pure cassavetes style. gena rowland gives a stunning performance of a declining actress, dealing with success, aging, loneliness...and alcoholism. she tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts, embodied by the death spectre of a young girl. acceptance of oneself, of human condition, though its overall difficulties, is the real purpose of the film. the parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself are puzzling: it\\'s like if the stage became a way out for the heroin. if all american movies could only be that top-quality, dealing with human relations on an adult level, not trying to infantilize and standardize feelings... one of the best dramas ever. 10/10. the 20th animated disney classic is often criticized by many people as \"mediocre\" or poor in quality, but it is a great movie. too bad that \"the aristocats\" doesn\\'t get the deserved credit. i personally see it as one of my favorite disney classics. despite being extremely underrated, it is one of the funniest disney classics. it is full of hilarious (some of them, hysterical) moments. edgar, the greedy butler, is the villain of the movie but he is a perfect comic relief. he\\'s one of my favorite disney villains because he is so funny. every scene with edgar and the hound dogs napoleon and lafayette chasing him are among the most hilarious you\\'ll ever see, especially the one when edgar drives his motorcycle into the river and around the bridge, with the dogs chasing him. that is hysterical! but the classic humor doesn\\'t just come from edgar or the hound dogs. other characters have their moments as well. about the quality subject, it isn\\'t perfect, but remains on a high level. even after walt disney\\'s death those artists knew how to keep faithful to walt\\'s spirit and \"the aristocats\" is one of those examples. they don\\'t make them like this nowadays! as usual, legendary disney actors voice the characters. in this case, we have phil harris, sterling holloway, paul winchell, eva gabor and pat buttram. the characters are cool in general: thomas o\\'malley, duchess and her 3 kittens, the mouse roquefort, the alley cats, the english geese, the hound dogs and the horse. the human characters are included as well: the eccentric and kind retired opera singer madame adelaide bonfamille, the comic madame\\'s old lawyer georges hautecourt and edgar himself! about the soundtrack, it has some nice and catchy songs such as thomas o\\'malley\\'s theme (but i can\\'t remember its name), \"everybody wants to be a cat\" and \"the aristocats\" (sung by maurice chevalier), for example. this movie takes place in paris (france), in the year of 1910. above all, this is a joyful, nice and very pleasant movie. a timeless classic which is often underestimated and forgotten, but very worthy. this should definitely be on top 250. i\\'m not going to say that this movie is horrible, because i have seen worse, but it\\'s not even halfway decent. the plot is very confusing. i couldn\\'t really figure out what was happening and where things were going. when the movie was over, i was left scratching my head. i watched through to the end of the credits to see if they had something after them that may clear things up, but once the credits were over, that was it. i felt like i was jarred from one weak plot point to another throughout the whole movie, with little or no transition between the two. character development is very shallow. i couldn\\'t figure out when somebody was angry or had a grudge against someone. i couldn\\'t tell if half of the characters were just supposed to be drunk, stoned, mentally challenged or they just had a bad actor to portray them. this film seems to be based around stereotypes (to it\\'s credit, they are hard to avoid using when you are making a film about a singer in a rock band), which should make character development easier, since so many other films have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child, or the trials of a heroin addict trying to come clean. stereotypes are easy to depict, which would explain why so many bad films tend to overuse stereotypical characters. this film, on the other hand, uses stereotypical characters left and right, but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible. another problem with the characters is that they seemed to be dismissed with no explanation. i guess that\\'s ok because so little time was spent developing the characters that i really didn\\'t get a chance to know any of them, so i never really missed any of them. and last but not least was sadie\\'s singing. it\\'s awful. the music backing her up is not prize winner, but it is usually drowned out by the screeches that are released from sadie\\'s vocal cords. i swear that there\\'s one point in the movie where she sings a song for at least 10 minutes. i seriously thought i was going to have to turn it off during this howl-a-thon. as a whole, this movie is confusing. characters are ill-developed, georgia\\'s acting is wooden and stiff, sadie\\'s character is yanked from one bad situation to another, with no back story or explanation. the music was unbearable, and i can think of no good reasons to see this film unless you have a thirst for cinematic pain. appalling, shallow, materialistic nonsense. how women (and gay men?) can enjoy this rubbish is beyond me. no self-respecting man would ever want to be with one of these neurotic gold diggers. what is even more concerning is that so many reviewers say they relate to the women on the show. if that is the future of women, lord help us all. showing your independence and being respected as equals with men should not be about spreading your legs every three seconds with a different man. i think this demeans women and does not do them justice. but this review is no rant against women. fans of this show say it is \"hilarious\" and \"rivoting\" but every time i have watched this show i have just struggled to stay awake. despite the narrative of the reporter woman, at no point in this show is there even anything close to something that could be considered a rational thought. so, it\\'s not entertaining, and it\\'s not informative, so why would you bother watching it? one out of ten stars. a throwback to the \"old fashioned\" westerns of the 30s and 40s (such as dodge city), dallas has a number of things going for it: gary cooper at his coolest, blazing technicolor photography by ernest haller (gone with the wind) and a pulse-pounding max steiner (king kong, gwtw, dodge city et al.) score. in addition, there is a masquerade, mistaken identity, a faked death and more hair-breath escapes than a republic serial. as always, cooper defines what it is to be a man under pressure. forget the 50s angst western... this is pure entertainment! we sat through this movie thinking why is this or that scene in the movie, what does this have to do with the plot? we hoped that by the end everything would be slightly more clear. it was not to be. i think the director in a fit of pique threw the script up in the air and then some minor (and vengeful) underling reassembled it randomly with no regard to the scene being filmed (possibly with scissors and glue-stick). the film\\'s motifs include: communism bad? nihilism bad? poor parenting bad? threesomes bad? tv bad? coherent scripting bad? deconstructionism good? it\\'s really not clear. finally, no german water taxi would ever have an unchained staircase that would let passengers fall in to the water. the abundant quantity of \"achtung\" signs everywhere is testament to this fact. on the back burner for years (so it was reported) this television reunion of two of the most beloved characters in sitcom history started off badly - and went straight downhill from there. mary richards (mary tyler moore) and her best friend rhoda morgenstern (valerie harper) meet in new york after a long estrangement and catch up on each other\\'s lives. what a novel concept! but, sad to relate, nothing worth talking about (let alone making a movie about) has happened to either of them in the intervening years. so, instead, the script contents itself with throwing out one hoary old plot device after another (most having to do with older women in the workplace), while completely missing the quirky charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner. the supporting cast is instantly forgettable, the humor is nonexistent, and the chemistry which moore and harper once had together is gone. moore allegedly stalled this project for years, waiting for \"just the right script\" before committing herself. if this was the one she considered \"right\", what on earth were the ones she turned down like? it\\'s not the age of the characters that does this in (for time inevitably marches on), but the almost complete lack of imagination coupled with a blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work. at one time this was intended as a pilot but, all to obviously, it failed to generate any interest among potential sponsors. or for that matter, among potential audiences. quickly and mercifully forgotten, the film is a travesty and an insult to a classic. **could be considered some mild spoilers, but no more than in anyone else\\'s review of this film.** i knew that nothing could conceivably live up to the absolute brilliance of the original \"carrie,\" which was more of a film about social criticism than it was about setting the gym on fire. carrie white was \"victim\" epitomized, and her story conveyed the helplessness that the truly exploited must feel. whoever conceived the \"rachel\" character for \"the rage\" must have completely missed the subtleties of \"carrie.\" for the audience to genuinely share the victim\\'s rage, s/he must be a sympathetic character-- a true outcast who is more a victim of circumstance than of his/her own vices. rachel is entirely too unpleasant to convey any sort of the emotional depth and connection of sissy spacek\\'s \"carrie.\" and she looks and acts like she should be right along-side the \\'attractive and popular brigade\\' that she ends up torching. she, like the rest of them, has a soul that is every bit as corrupt, whereas carrie was a complete innocent. it just doesn\\'t work. there\\'s no satisfaction in seeing the pretty children-- not even the \"home improvement\" boy-- getting offed in this movie\\'s climactic scene. and it\\'s so unnecessarily gory! there was no actual bloodshed seen in the burning gym! and there is one person in particular that this movie should not have had the audacity to kill off... but i won\\'t say who it is. if you\\'ve seen the original \"carrie,\" it\\'s the sort of character who dies unjustly. at least they did create the connection to carrie appropriately; it\\'s explained as it should have been. but that, and the arm tattoo, which was done rather nicely, is just about the only thing this movie has going for it. yet another hideous \"scream\" knock-off, and it taints the reputation of one of the most compelling films ever made. rating: 1 out of 10. i wasn\\'t expecting much, but i was still horribly disappointed. an unsympathetic character, a series of irritating pop-culture references thrown in for no good reason, and an ending scene that pales in comparison to \"carrie\"\\'s gravestone shocker. better than average world war ii-era \"who-dun-it\" featuring warner baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and has been reborn as a psychiatrist now known as robert ordway who helps both the police and criminals who want to go straight. crime doctor\\'s courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also involves a victim who might have some mental problems. the link to \"courage\" is not particularly clear. this entry revolves around the death of fortune hunter gordon carson whose two previous wives have under mysterious circumstances and who in turn dies in a locked room under conditions that resemble suicide but dr. ordway labels murder. hillary brooke plays the part of widow kathleen carson who is involved with anthony caruso - a mysterious spanish dancer whose act includes his sister that disappears on stage. as a mystery novelist, jerome cowan is a good supporting actor as is lloyd corrigan as an aficionado in crime. spooky houses with creaking doors, caskets in the cellar, and suspects that are never seen in daylight add to the air of suspense. the set for the dance sequence is quite elaborate and the ballet music very good. direction, production design, and photography stand out. the exterior shots and costumes suggest more affluence rather than normally found in the average \"b\" detective thriller. strongly recommended. i had high hopes for this movie. the theater monologue is great and nic balthazar is a very interesting man, with a lot of experience and knowledge when it comes to movies. i am a fan of a lot of belgian movies, but this movie is bad. it\\'s completely unbelievable that actors who are 34 are suddenly playing the roles of teenagers. the \"linguistic games\" were hideous and over the top. nothing about the film seemed real to me. the ending was way too deus ex machina for me. i am very disappointed and think i wasted an hour and a half of my life. i am not a big fan of rajnikant in the first place, but baba was a huge disappointment. in between an awful storyline, the action and songs were only mediocre. the storyline becomes very preachy. instead of running for office like ntr or mgr, rajni almost appeared to be running as tamil nadu\\'s next big guru. my wife tells me that since this film came out, rajni swore off doing any more movies! we were lucky initially to have bought babu (an oldie by sivajiganeshan) online by accident when trying to buy this one....that was a great film, which made up for having bought this dud...except it makes baba look even worse by comparison! bryan truly a disgusting, vile film, with only a small amount of real humour. the character of the father in particular is vulgar in the extreme (intentionally so, obviously), and portrayed in the most pathetic, seedy manner. my wife and i found this film horribly upsetting, with absolutely no redeeming features at all. frankly, i wish i had never seen it. i consider this british effort to be a sick and gross embarrassment. those who enjoyed this film have an ability i totally lack: that of rejoicing in a display of deep depravity and squalor. the producers should be ashamed of themselves. obabakoak is a bunch of short stories with an only common point: the little vasque town of obaba. in this film, the director tries to explain some of these stories by using a young reporter as a continuum. the result is a strange film, as it has any main character (the movie spends about 20 min. to each tale) other than the town of obaba. any story is really well explained and the fact is that they result very boring. it was by far the best film of the year in spain, but, well, that\\'s not saying too much. the only good thing of the film is the precious scenarios. it is filmed in a very precious valley and it is more enjoyable to spend the time watching the scenario rather than being aware of the story. the entire civilized world by now knows that this is where emil sitka says his immortal \"hold hands, you lovebirds.\" but shemp howard, professor of music, steals the show. watch him tutoring dee green as she fractures the \"voices of spring.\" watch shemp as he shaves by a mirror suspended from the ceiling by a string. watch him as he gets walloped by christine mcintyre. watch him, and you will laugh and learn. moe is no slouch either. watch him as he attempts to induce a woman to sit on a bear trap. larry, as usual, is the zen master of reaction. all in all, one of the very best stooge shorts. you won\\'t find one weak moment. i\\'m a huge fan of war movies, and, as a vietnam combat vet, have some experience with the technical details. i worked with the bomb guys more than once and have nothing but respect for them. other vets, and iraq vets in particular, have summarized the inaccuracies in this movie very well. poetic license is one thing, but this movie is a complete fantasy, and fails badly because of it. no bomb disposal unit, or any unit, would ever have tolerated this rogue operator for more than 5 minutes. military units prize conformity and discipline for a reason;it saves lives. the opening scene particularly annoyed me. the guy with the cell phone would have been shot immediately. yelling, \"stop dialing\" is not an effective deterrent. it got worse from there. the scenes with the sniper were particularly egregious. as others have noted, your average eod guy doesn\\'t know jack about being a sniper, and to think any arab sniper is that good really stretches the imagination. kidnapping an arab businessman for some form of personal revenge just wouldn\\'t happen. somebody might shoot him, but this kind of risk-taking is limited to the movies. i could go on, but, as i said, others have pointed these things out in detail. this is not a good movie, and if it wins any awards at all, it\\'s a further reflection of why \"la la land\" is so named. all right, here\\'s the deal: if you\\'re easily offended then you might want to stay far, far away from this one. there are some painfully funny moments in the movie, but i probably blushed about as much as i laughed. actually, i probably blushed more than i laughed. and if i wasn\\'t literally blushing on the outside, then i was blushing on the inside. if there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you then you simply have no shame. whether that\\'s a badge of honor or not is in the eye of the beholder i suppose. i will not deny that i laughed quite a bit, but this is a movie that i simply cannot give a blanket recommendation due to its subject matter. if i were to say, \"this movie is hilarious, go check it out!\" and some sweet, little old church-going lady heads to the theater and has a heart-attack during one of the graphically explicit sex situations, well, that\\'s just something i don\\'t need on my conscience. so how raunchy is it? hmm, try about 100 times worse than the wedding crashers. honestly. my mom would\\'ve walked out during the first scene. i feel it\\'s my duty to at least warn you of what to expect. there is some cleverly intelligent comedy here, but that\\'s what i come to expect from the man (judd apatow) who had a hand in both freaks and geeks and undeclared. i\\'m all for making fun of michael mcdonald; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give kenny rogers a run for his money. paul rudd proclaiming, \"if i hear ya mo be there one more time i\\'ll ya mo burn this place down,\" is hilarious, but it\\'s one of those things that the majority of the audience won\\'t appreciate. and when we see a quick 3-second flashback of steve carrell singing along to cameo\\'s word up, i laughed for a good two minutes after the joke was over, whereas most everybody chuckled and then forgot about it. strangely enough, despite the raunch, there\\'s an admirable moral to the story. the movie doesn\\'t portray carrell as some freaky loser just because he\\'s a virgin. he\\'s really portrayed as a likable, admirable character. sure, he\\'s a little weird. after all, he has a framed asia poster, \"more videogames than an asian kid,\" and a toy collection that features the million dollar man\\'s boss, but we\\'re never led to believe that there\\'s actually anything wrong with the fact that he\\'s a virgin. as odd as it may seem, there\\'s a bit of an \"it\\'s ok to wait\" message. but man, oh man, please be warned that this pushes its r rating about as far as it can go. that was certainly apatow\\'s intention. according to him, he just let some of the guys (particularly rogen and malco) improv and talk the way they normally talk, all in an effort to find lots of new ways to be dirty. if you can handle that or talk that way yourself, then you\\'ll love the movie. i\\'m not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes. i find that subtle, clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of the f-word or fratboy sex discussions. but that\\'s me. like i said, there are some absolutely hysterical moments here, but you have to ask yourself if they\\'re worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies you\\'re likely to ever see at the theater. i just don\\'t know how interested most women will be in what\\'s discussed by men while playing poker. honestly ladies, you might not want to know. if you\\'ve ever been curious why some girls think guys are gross, well, this gives you a good idea. there you go - my humble, honest take on what to expect. be that your guide. it definitely should not be seen with your sunday school class, mama, grandmama, any family members of the opposite sex, children of any age, or anybody who is easily offended by excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion. if you\\'d see it with any of the above then you apparently do not have any concept of what it means to be uncomfortable. saw this a couple times on the sundance channel several years ago and received a nice cinematic jolt to the system. a semi-surreal yet hard edged take on modern media culture (or the lack of it), focusing on some seriously wacked, way-beyond-the-hollywood-fringe dwellers. it had an amusing early performance from mark ruffalo, and some memorable cinematography from the dp who did the polish brothers movies. there was a savage umcompromising humor and a weirdly original feel to it that definitely set it apart. this film had cult classic written all over it, and i\\'m surprised it\\'s not yet out on dvd. hopefully soon. if you liked the first two films, then i\\'m sorry to say you\\'re not going to like this one. this is the really rubbish and unnecessary straight to video, probably tv made sequel. the still idiotic but nice scientist wayne szalinski (rick moranis) is still living with his family and he has his own company, szalinski inc. unfortunately his wife wants to get rid of a statue, wayne is so stupid he shrinks his statue and himself with his brother. then he shrinks his wife and sister-in-law too. now the adults have to find a way to get the kids of the house to get them bigger. pretty much a repeat of the other two with only one or two new things, e.g. a toy car roller coaster, swimming in dip, etc. pretty poor! there was nothing remotely funny about this movie. it makes fun of various sports movies and clichã©s but nothing about it is remotely funny. most of the movies they parody doesn\\'t even fit in with the film and are really only their so they can be in it. non the main actor was well cast in it but that\\'s really the only good thing about this film. also the various cameos in it were kind of cool to see but i have no idea why they would waste their time being in this piece of garbage. thank goodness i only spent $4 on it as this is not something worth spending money on. only watch if you have absolutely nothing to do or just want to waste an hour and 30 minutes. i love this film, it is excellent and so funny, ben is fit and i wouldn\\'t mind meeting him on holiday!! i rate this film a 10 because its gr8 and i hope they never re make it because it would never be the same. funny bit is wen andre is looking at the moon,and he shouts at nicole to \\'come outside and look at the moon\\' that bit always makes me laugh and never gets old. another thing is nicole looks a lot older then 14... but shes a gr8 actress. but i need help with something does n e 1 no the name of the song played at the end wen nicole and andre are dancing??? its really bugging me because i want 2 no what it is because its a nice song!! darling lili is a mixture of perfection and magic! the stars; julie andrews & rock hudson could not have done a better attempt if they tried. it\\'s full of all the magic that a young lady wishes for and it makes it seem as if it can all really happen to you. the brilliance of the director; blake edwards is shown to be at his best. he was truly capturing the woman he loved on screen! the blend of each song, went perfectly with the moment in the film. the film opened with julie andrews singing whistling away in the dark and closed with the same song by andrews. for a film of this excellence to have been such a failure when it was released, is a total shock... as it is: \"inspirational...purely....inspirational!\" ~one of andrews most memorable lines in this film! good grief! while i still maintain that manos: the hands of fate is the worst piece of mental torture available, hobgoblins came awfully close. this...this...thing insults the audience at every opportunity. at least films like space mutiny and future war can be enjoyed on mst3k, this one was a struggle to get through. i was literally writhing on the couch in anguish. this thing managed to embarrass me - alone! even if you are a die-hard mst3k fan and have made it your mission to see every single experiment, think twice about seeing this one. it\\'s that bad. if you haven\\'t figured out what is going to happen in this film in the first five minutes then give it a couple more minutes. lilia is a widow. she has been left on the shelf for too long and she wants to burst out. she has a teenage daughter which only highlights that she is not getting any younger. while checking up on her daughter she discovers a world she never dared...the cabaret, where she can belly dance in skimpy sequined outfits while men throw money at her. the film is very misogamist. it\\'s portrayal of men is dismal. which is rather odd as lilia stoops to jiggle around for them, not for money, but just for the hell of it. when she succeeds in arousing them it makes her feel like a woman again. she does not wish to connect with them but she is addicted to the attention. the other dancers all are mostly aging women who look like men in drag and realize their time in the spotlight is short-lived. not short enough i say. she does find romance, however brief , with you guessed it....no surprises here we didn\\'t see coming. though the ending is good you realize that it could have ended no other way. maybe this film just isn\\'t targeting my demographic- 30 male first of all. i do not look down on americans. i know lots of people that are intelligent people from the usa. but this movie is so utterly bad, that i just had to comment on it. first of all...movies are mostly far from the truth. this movie is no exception. lots of scene\\'s are so incredibly false. for example the departure of the 2 space ships. you see them drop off the full tanks in space. just a small distance from each other. remember what caused the space shuttle to explode in the past ? just a tinsy winsy part that came off. in here it is just common to drop fuel tanks that are as big if not bigger then the whole ship. what idiot would let 2 spaceships lift up and do that at the same time ??? second of it is that the russian station is a piece of (s)crap. i hate to bring this up to you, but astronauts nowadays go to russia. since their equipment is much more reliable then nasa\\'s. the space shuttle is retired. and nasa uses it just to pay off the bills. and there is no better alternative for it. and the list of whoppers goes on and on. this is truly an insult to people that do take space travel serious. and i know half as much as these guys do. but the most annoying part ( read: the whole movie ) is the propaganda and patriot crap that u get choked with. my god !!!! i thought i was looking at a cnn business commercial for like an hour. the actors solve their petty problems by shooting at each other, giving the middle finger to everyone they come face to face with, start up fights, ignore the police, etc, etc... but when it comes to their love for their country and sacrificing their lives, suddenly everyone stands in line to commit suicide for it ( bomb detonator ) ?? maybe i lack the feeling of being a true \"patriot\", that can sing the national anthem backwards in swahili. whilst riding with george bush behind the steering wheel of a golf cart, driving in circles until the battery is empty. but this movie was too much for me too handle. and when i finally got hold and pulled the flag pole and fabric of the american flag out of my hiney. i realised that i was glad this movie was finally done. i do not know why so much good actors participated in this narrow minded, stereotyping, propaganda movie. but i pity them. this represents a country where you can get away with murder if you have money or power. as long as \"uncle sam\" thinks you are a good patriot. where everyone is happy as long as it is another country that has been devastated, no one cares. the sort of \"little\" film which studios used to excel at but seldom make anymore. sort of a \"soul\" version of the more well-known \"the last of the blonde bombshells\". ian mcshane is excellent as a dj and aficionado of soul music who becomes obsessed with the idea of re-uniting the members of a classic soul group, and the film follows his exploits as well as those of the group members; a cast which includes such genuine musical talent as isaac hayes, as well as acting stalwarts taurean blacque, derrick o\\'connor and antonio fargas. not meant to be an epic by any means, this is nonetheless a chunk of solid gold. i do not like himesh reshamiya. i do not like his singing too. but his songs are a craze in india, especially among commoners. now when he ventured to become an actor â– that was a big joke! what guts he has to reap as much as he can in his prime time. i did never want to see this movie. but one thing changed it. the movie becoming a super-duper hit! after 2 weeks, aap ka saroor has raked box office collection of 14 crores â– compared to apne that has collected 7 crores in the same 2 weeks. if i can sit through apne and rajnikant\\'s absurd sivaji â– i should give this movie also a try to understand what stuff this movie has got that made it such a big hit? the story is about the real life singer himesh reshamiya (hr) who has gone to germany for a concert and falls in love with riya (hansika motwani). a german lawyer ruby (mallika sherawat) loves himesh. now himesh is arrested for a murder. the mission of himesh (in last 40 minutes) after he runs away from jail is to prove himself innocent and find the real murderer. let me say that himesh has nothing in him to become a hero. he tries hard but fails miserably. he is pathetic. i was thinking what could have made the movie click so much? let me find something positive. first, the saving grace of the movie is the script till the point himesh runs away from the jail. (but after that the movie nose dives into unbearable stupid limits) second, the songs of the movie are good, catchy, crowd puller numbers. third, mallika sherawat â– she looks gorgeous and acts well too, as the second lady. i can imagine fans of mallika coming to see the movie just for her. fourth, the cinematography of the movie is pleasing â– especially the german locales, are a treat to watch for the eye. fifth, the major portion of the story is a love story between himesh and riya â– with clichã©d dialogues that would probably connect to young crowd. sixth, the director prashant chadha has done a decent job in covering the pathetic acting skills of himesh as much as possible with shots that don\\'t need himesh to act much. the heroine hansika motwani looks like a small budget film heroine. raj babbar is wasted in a small role. overall the movie is a below average. i was thinking throughout the movie â– what if the same movie script was done with salmaan as the main lead. i think it would have had been a much better affair. may be then i would have given the movie 6 out of 10. but nowâ… (stars 4.5 out of 10) even for a tired movie model as the nature vs. man cycle that prevailed so predominantly in the 1970s, ants falls miserably short of being even somewhat effective(though entertaining for reasons it was not intending). it is sooooo preposterous. apparently these ants that are bulldozed near an inn have been eating poisonous waste for decades and have now adapted by emitting poisonous bites - hundreds of these bites being fatal. watching actors of some notoriety clumsily fall amidst tiny black specks is painfully funny in a not-so-good-but very-bad way. so many scenes just look ludicrous: a boy trying to fall in a dumpster whilst being attacked, suzanne sommers crying out in horror while lounging in bed, robert foxworth and lynda george breathing through pieces of wallpaper, bernie casey faking a gam leg, and the list goes on and on. the peril shown ranges from ants crawling from a drain to black lines of ants all over the walls. the cast for the film is not bad on paper, but none of these actors seem to believe in the material. poor myrna loy has to sit in a wheelchair through this horror. i hope she found a good use for the money, for it is obvious that was the only reason a woman of her pedigree would be in this nonsense. although it is quite a bad film, it is watchable - once for me, and does have many of those seventies bad film qualities - start-studded actors embarrassing themselves, that made-for-tv feel, and the dreaded creatures of nature reeking vengeance on man. this time man must push his hand into a pile of ants to be affected. really quite dreadful. ghillie a remake of the telugu \"okkadu\\' is thankfully a clarified version of the original. it packs the same punch and dharani true to his cinematic brilliance delivers it with style and panache. a flagging vijay\\'s career with the entry of the likes of surya and vikram on the fray, got the much needed uplift with this movie. this might well prove to be the best movie vijay has ever been on, considering the choices he has been making since then. the hard-working actor seems to have lost his bearing what with talented new entrants being accepted both by the industry and public alike. the tightly snug script, which runs at, a neck-break speed revolves around velu, a willful youngster aspiring to make a mark in the game of kabaddi( a popular game among boys in india). the events following the chance encounter with muthupandi, his rescue of the girl in distress and how he juggles with the aspirations of his friends and his own forms the fulcrum and end of the movie. vijay fits as a \\'t\\' into the role and essays a subdued and believable portrayal of the boy next door. trisha has more than a stereotyped tamil heroine mantle to play. the role is far more complex than just a girl in trouble. with limited dialog\\'s, trisha exploits her occasional muted expressions and subtle vulnerability to add color to the role. this is a classic case of a cover page girl coming-of-age to become a professional actress. trisha became my personal favorite after this movie. the movie ends on predictable lines, although one has to credit the director for keeping the audience guessing on many things including trisha\\'s change in decision to leave the country. prakash raj deserves a word of praise for providing the perfect counter-weight for vijay\\'s role. his almost indomitable stature in the role of a villain and the apparent chinks in the hero\\'s armor form a perfect ploy for keeping the audience guessing. overall this is a great movie that deserves at least a single viewing. i give it a clear 8 out of 10. the only reason i give it a 2 is that filmography is so stylized these days such that it has at least something to comment on. this film is asinine. it\\'s like so many other 21st century grind house fodder. the gore is gratuitous and simply revolting. i didn\\'t care about any of the characters, but i did care that some cretin bothered to pen this crap: i\\'d complain about the money i spent, but my date and i wisely left after 40 minutes and went to an adjoining theater to watch the adventurous and entertaining \"live free or die hard,\" which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because i endured the utter poop of \"captivity\" for 40 minutes. this is a big step down after the surprisingly enjoyable original. this sequel isn\\'t nearly as fun as part one, and it instead spends too much time on plot development. tim thomerson is still the best thing about this series, but his wisecracking is toned down in this entry. the performances are all adequate, but this time the script lets us down. the action is merely routine and the plot is only mildly interesting, so i need lots of silly laughs in order to stay entertained during a \"trancers\" movie. unfortunately, the laughs are few and far between, and so, this film is watchable at best. a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie. it\\'s based on a novel of the same title, which was equally good, though different from the film. really made you think about how you\\'d respond if you were in the shoes of the characters. recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent, spouse, or family member--in other words, everyone! though the production isn\\'t quite hollywood quality--no big special effects--still, the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it. and the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members, and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes ill. you don\\'t want to miss this! the title suggests that this movie is a sequel to \"an american werewolf in london\". none of the characters from the previous movie return and aren\\'t even mentioned in this movie by name. so as a sequel, aawip fails, one would say. i dare to say the opposite. an american werewolf in paris is a charming, effective horror movie. it\\'s one of the better werewolf films i have seen in a long time too. and i have seen quite my share, such as an american werewolf in london, the howling, wolfen, the wolfman and the underworld trilogy. the story tells of three americans visiting paris on a vacation. at the top of the eifel tower one of them saves a woman trying to commit suicide. what starts out as a romantic relationship slowly turns into a nightmare when the dark secrets that lurk in the city are revealed... i really liked the acting in this film. especially the two stars of the movie: the woman who tried to commit suicide and the guy who saves her. they have good chemistry together. but the other two americans also play their roles nicely. i didn\\'t really find anything annoying about the acting, so thumbs up for that! the effects on the werewolves are nice. it doesn\\'t look too cheap or fake to me. of course, the opinions are divided about this subject. but let\\'s just say that i wasn\\'t disappointed. there\\'s also a good amount of humor in this movie. there are some really funny scenes you will probably remember for a long time. so, to sum it up, an american werewolf in paris might not be a direct sequel to it\\'s predecessor, but it\\'s still an enjoyable movie. perfect for fans of werewolves! 7 out of 10 stars! please, future writers, producers, directors - learn from this movie! never before have i seen such a bold and original tale created for the big movie screen. bold, because the script constantly made a step so many fantasy movies safely avoided - a step to something new, creative and daring. just when you think \\'oh, i\\'ve seen this before\\' or \\'i am sure this is what will happen now\\' - stardust would make an unexpected twist and involve you more and more into the story. the actors are great - even the smallest part is performed with such talent it fills me with awe for the creators of this movie. robert de niro is gorgeous and performs with such energy that he simply steals the show in each scene he\\'s in. michelle pfeiffer is the perfect witch, and claire danes a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving \\'star\\', yvaine. other big names make outstanding roles. i had the filling everyone is trying to give his best for this movie. but once again, the story by neil gaiman, all the little things he \\'invented\\' for this universe - simply outstanding. i watched this movie at a pre-screening today, a day before the official release, and do hope it will have huge success. there is so much humor, but also tense moments as well as lovely tender scenes. the look in the eyes of yvaine, the \\'frivolities\\' of captain shakespeare, the passion of lamia the witch - impressive, unforgettable for me this is the number one entertaining movie of 2007, watch it and enjoy it 11/10 - outstanding peace and love once again, we are fortunate to see a gorgeous opening scene where the artists\\' work has been fully restored and we see this old-time grocery store on a street corner with the snow gently falling. inside are the rich colors of all the merchandise, from produce to canned and boxed goods to medicine to candy, etc. in essence, this is a story of those goods \"coming to life,\" such as the animals on the labels of items, or a pie, or even a pack of cigarettes. the whole \"show\" is narrated by \"jack bunny,\" a jack benny impersonator, with music from conductor leopold stokowski, who was in so many looney tunes animated shorts i have lost count. a lot of the humor is topical, so it pays to know who \"little egypt\" and other characters. the busby berkeley-type \"aqua\" number with bathing suited-sardines coming out of the can, and the tomato can-can dance were both clever! all of the above, and more, was in the first half of this slightly longer-than-normal length cartoon. the second half was about a king kong-type which escapes from the \"animal crackers\" box and terrorizes everyone. that part was not much, and ended on a somewhat stupid note. so..... an \"a\" for the first half, a \"d\" for the second, making it about a c-plus or b-minus overall. henry fool surprised me. i didn\\'t expect it to entertain and amuse as well, or as strongly, as it did. fay grim continues to surprise in that it provides solid continuation to a story that seems not to need it. once the viewer watches the first 20 minutes of the movie, however, it becomes blindingly aware that this is one of the best sequels to brilliant indie film. at least as good as ginger snaps back, if not better. i am a little disappointed that jeff goldblum\\'s part is so small, but i\\'m happy he is a part of this short run. he is convincing and delightful as agent fulbright. also a delight is liam aiken who quite aptly portrays ned grim, the son of fay and henry. this movie is a pleasure for so many reasons. i am pleased, for example, to discover that henry isn\\'t really the loser he seems (by the end of fool), and to further discover that he is, in fact, a genius...well, that really is a lovely stroke of the pen. i am hoping they do a third...like the end of the trilogy. it seems to be missing. they should entitle it ned fool grim and it should be liam looking for his father, to validate the awesome change in his mother, and the sense of near-genius he himself feels welling inside him. assuming, of course, that fay continues withholding many of the most important facts from her son, concerning his father. it feels like it needs to be done. i\\'d buy it. even with more action, this is still not an action flick. it is more drama and intrigue...a mystery, of sorts. i\\'ll watch it often. it rates an 8.3/10 from... the fiend :. so tell me - what serious boozer drinks budweiser? how many suicidally-obsessed drinkers house a fully stocked and barely touched range of drinks in their lonely motel room that a millionaire playboy\\'s bachelor-pad bar would be proud to boast? and what kind of an alcoholic tends to drink with the bottle held about 8 inches from his hungry mouth so that the contents generally spill all over his face? not to mention wasting good whisky by dousing your girlfriend\\'s tits with it, just so the cinema audience can get a good eyeful of elisabeth shue\\'s assets. cage seems to be portraying the most attention-seeking look-at-me alcoholic ever to have graced the screen while shue looks more like a berkely preppy slumming it for a summer than some seasoned street-walker. she is humiliated and subjugated as often as possible in this revolting movie with beatings, skin lacerations, anal rape and graphic verbal abuse - all of it completely implausible and included apparently only to convey a sense of her horribly demeaned state and offer the male viewers an astonishingly clichã©d sentimental sexual fantasy of the \\'tart-with-a-heart\\'. still - i did watch it to the end, by which time i was actually laughing out loud as shue\\'s tough street hooker chopped carrots in the kitchen wanly, pathetically smiling while cage - all eyes popping and shaking like like a man operating a road drill in an earthquake - grimaced and mugged his way through the final half-hour... at first i had the reaction a lot of people left with after seeing this: that shots of fat people sunbathing, etc were cheap shots in a way. ok so he\\'s doing diane arbus meets. . . whatever. . . but it wasn\\'t long before i realized that this wasn\\'t being done in a dehumanizing way, as the images unfold i felt that the problem was entirely the audience\\'s: we are conditioned by hollywood and also movies from just about everywhere actually to feel that to watch people above a certain age behave in a sexual way is something unseemly, something that ought not to be shown. if this were all the film offered it would be a great deal. however, the story of the woman with the abusive boyfriend and his drunk friend really hits like a ton of bricks: very eloquent storytelling, incredible performances, and to think the scene was improvised. that blonde guy is a genius actor. finally i want to contradict those who say this film is all about how pathetic all these people are. the old man who is on the make with the woman who finally dances for him is completely an a ok character that breaks that mold, so don\\'t oversimplify the film by overlooking him. yes his dog gets killed. this ain\\'t a rosy picture of the world but it\\'s not . . . completely hopeless. anyway i felt really grateful to the filmmaker for making such a beautiful film all in all. i wouldn\\'t say each of the threads were as strong as the strongest, but i say this movie basically kicks ass and would highly recommend it. . . one of my absolute favorite childhood films. the chipmunk adventure packs incredible fun geared for young and old alike. the animation is lively and colorful and the film itself boasts some of the best songs ever put in an animated feature. who could forget the dynamic \"boys/girls of rock n\\' roll\", the exciting \"diamond dolls\", and the heartrending \"my mother\"? this should be considered a nostalgic classic animated gem from the eighties. it\\'s too bad they don\\'t make them like this anymore. most animated films today resort to violence, crude humor, or sentimental mush... except of course the folks from pixar. bottom line: an amazing and unforgettable adventure for all ages. it\\'s this sort of movie that you try and imitate. by attempting to realise something... then flying through the air almost immediately. i\\'d like to do that and i know you would too! great stuff! a lot of people give this movie a lot of crap, and all of it\\'s really undeserved. people give this movie a hard time either because it\\'s such a sick subject or they harp on some technical aspect of the movie no one else observes when they watch it. if, just by looking at the cover, you think this movie will make you uncomfortable...don\\'t watch it! however, you\\'d be missing out on one of the better cinematic experiences of the late 1990\\'s, despite what anyone else says. dee snider is wonderful here as captain howdy, the depths of insanity he plumbs to play this character has to be beyond words, and is much farther than any one of us would have to be willing to go. the acting here is wonderful. the film itself beautifully shot. the subject may be a bit too much for many to swallow, but it\\'s still well worth your time. if you haven\\'t seen this movie, check it out. today i found \"they all laughed\" on vhs on sale in a rental. it was a really old and very used vhs, i had no information about this movie, but i liked the references listed on its cover: the names of peter bogdanovich, audrey hepburn, john ritter and specially dorothy stratten attracted me, the price was very low and i decided to risk and buy it. i searched imdb, and the user rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. i looked in \"mick martin & marsha porter video & dvd guide 2003\" and â– wow â– four stars! so, i decided that i could not waste more time and immediately see it. indeed, i have just finished watching \"they all laughed\" and i found it a very boring overrated movie. the characters are badly developed, and i spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. the plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but i have not laughed along the whole story. the coincidences, in a huge city like new york, are ridiculous. ben gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a brad pitt, antonio banderas or george clooney, is quite ridiculous. in the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the playboy centerfold and playmate of the year dorothy stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in \"star 80\" and \"death of a centerfold: the dorothy stratten story\"; the amazing beauty of the sexy patti hansen, the future mrs. keith richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, audrey hepburn; and the song \"amigo\", from roberto carlos. although i do not like him, roberto carlos has been the most popular brazilian singer since the end of the 60\\'s and is called by his fans as \"the king\". i will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly dorothy stratten). my vote is four. title (brazil): \"muito riso e muita alegria\" (\"many laughs and lots of happiness\") it amazes me that someone would actually consider spending some money on a movie like this. really. let\\'s forget for a second that the plot doesn\\'t even give a single hint of originality... most of the movies today are based on other movies\\' stories, so a \"simple\" lack of originality is not that big a deal. but i can hardly believe that none of the guys involved in the movie had never even got on a plane before shooting this. because, let\\'s be honest, that would be the only excuse to come up with something so ridiculous. to be sincere i think a 6-years-old child with a fake camera could have come up with something technically much more believable. some examples following. the scene that really drove me crazy is when the engines turn off when they regain control of the plane. when they have to turn them on again the guy on the radio says something like \"ok, push the 1 and 2 buttons on the dashboard\". now, those are not buttons. they should not be pushed, they should actually be pulled up and toward the pilot. that\\'s something only plane-addicted would know, you say? wrong. the next scene you can see their fingers pushing the \"buttons\"... and of course the so called \"buttons\" don\\'t move at all! not even a single millimeter! (and note that i haven\\'t even mentioned the fact that aircraft engines are not like cars engine, that you just turn the key and the magic happens... you have to do quite a complicated procedure to turn them on...) come on guys! you could have faked the movements at least!! not to mention the hilarious final impact, where the plane crashes against every single thing along the runway (light poles along the runway? what where they thinking?!)... and the wings don\\'t even get ripped off! it happened to me too, once... except the plane was made of lego! what about the flight attendant? she\\'s actually so skilled that she perfectly knows where the \"aux 1\" and \"aux 2\" fuses are, in the middle of the wires behind the cockpit. should we mention, then, the guy that can drive an ambulance _and_ fly a plane behind the ambulance using his computer? and how did he turn the other airplane engines on? really, i could go on hours with this stuff. this is the dumbest movie i\\'ve ever come across, and i\\'m including garbage like alone in the dark and other stuff in the list. want to do yourself a favor? don\\'t watch it. cedric klapisch\\'s movie l\\'auberge espagnole is easy, breezy charm wrapped in nostalgia for our younger years and attractive youths. at its core, it\\'s the feature-length presentation of the long-running mtv reality soap opera known as \"the real world\" in which, as its motto goes: \"this is the \\'true story\\' of seven strangers picked to live in a house and have their lives taped... so watch what happens when people stop being polite and start getting real.\" this is exactly what happens -- minus the cameras planted at every minuscule corner of the house in barcelona, spain, where xavier (romain duris) comes to stay, having to learn spanish to fill into his job\\'s requirements. an outsider in many ways, he slowly forms a camaraderie with his house-mates who come from all corners of europe except america... this is a movie in which the only american shown is an unlikable character with whom wendy (the adorable kelly reilly) is having an affair with (\"only for sex,\" she confesses, since she has her own boyfriend who makes a late but dazed appearance.). throughout his stay there, he tries to maintain a long-distance relationship with his girlfriend played by audrey tautou while he begins a tentative flirtation with the wife of the owner of the spanish house where he is staying at and gets some advice from a lesbian house-mate (cecile de france) as to how to seduce a woman. a sweet little feature that presents a moment in time that twenty-somethings will never see again, l\\'auberge espagnole is forgettable fun containing within itself the threshold into the \"real world\" experienced through xavier\\'s eyes. hitchcock would be proud of this movie. even when nothing happens, it is suspenseful. director david lynch overuses a few cheap thrill tricks here and there, but he intersperses them with other cinematographic techniques to keep it from becoming obtuse. altogether surreal, this movie is like waking up and remembering most of a dream but not enough to make it sensible. i am still trying to figure it all out and will probably have to see it again to catch things i missed and which may help me understand it better. it is a very detailed plot that very slowly comes together, so you must be patient and pay attention. get your bathroom trip out of the way before it starts. and yet, the plot is overshadowed by the theme, the mood, the character development, and the filming techniques. the dual roles of the main actress, naomi watts, showcase her enormous talent. that is, when i could get my eyes off of her co-star. what an acting pair. lynch surprises throughout the movie with unusual camera angles, the length/timing of editing cuts, jumping back and forth between scenes. combined with smart use of music and sounds, it all helps to build suspense in our minds, doubtless a major objective of the director. well, he kept me on the edge of my seat, even had me talking to the actors to be careful here, and not be so naive there. you know, the kind of stuff you want to smack your kids for doing at the movies. i am working at a video store so i got to see this one for free- thank god, had i paid for it my review would be less forgiving. well, the major idea of the film (geeky girl takes bloody revenge) isn\\'t all that original, there are several parallels to \"carrie\" (playing a mean practical joke on a loser, except for one nice girl that is actually sorry for her, tamaras and carries bad family background). i still think it\\'s a fun idea for trashy teen horror flick unfortunately they didn\\'t take much advantage of the potentials that are here and rather put an emphasis on all the wrong things. what worked: i liked the actress that played tamara. she looked great (when she was hot) and her catty lines were fun (\"sean can\\'t come to the phone. he\\'s f**king patrick!\"). what didn\\'t work: the whole wicca thing was silly. i generally prefer rational explanations (she could have ploted the whole thing with her teacher or one of the boys to get her revenge). there were a lot of logical wholes and the gore looked really bad (when the boy is cutting of his ear and his tongue- please!!!) the whole idea wasn\\'t bound for oscar buzz, but i just think they wasted the comedic and the suspenseful potential they had. it was bearable but far from good! yes, this bizarre feature was written by john sayles. shot in toronto, it\\'s yet another \\'80s era feature about the dangers of the urban jungle, where the police fear to go and the homeless and the criminal classes are the only inhabitants. into this mix comes the myth of wild thing, a feral young man raised by a bag lady after his parents were murdered by a dirty cop on the take (maury chaykin) and chopper, the local crime lord (robert davi). stir in the local do-gooders (priest sean hewitt and clueless social worker kathleen quinlan), and you have a recipe for some rather unexciting action sequences. davi is the standout amongst the cast, and cinematographer rene verzier does a pretty good job. otherwise this is a rather lumpen action pic that won\\'t satisfy action fans and will leaves sayles\\' admirers slack-jawed. absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever seen! the acting, the dialog, the manuscript, the sound, the lighting, the plot line. i actually can\\'t say anything positive about this, although i enjoy swedish movies. the fighting scenes are so ridiculous that it\\'s impossible to take it seriously. and when the lead character just happens to loose his shirt, while dodging bullets in a strip bar, i\\'m not sure if it\\'s supposed to be a joke, or if someone really thinks these are ingredients in a good film?! regina lund is the only half descent actor, but she disappears in a flood of laughable pronunciations and unbelievable reactions. it leaves you horrified that someone actually spent time and money on something like this... \"plots with a view\" of 2002 is a delightful little comedy like only the british could do it. the film\\'s sense of humor is both mildly morbid and black and yet very lovable and sometimes very slapstick-ish. it\\'s the only film by director nick hurran i\\'ve seen so far, and while i am not intending to watch any of his other films at the moment (i\\'m not a big fan of romantic comedies), this one is highly enjoyable and very funny. the film takes place in a little town in wales, where betty rhys-jones (brenda blethyn) is married to the town\\'s drunken and adulterous major (robert pugh). the local mortician boris (alfred molina) has been desperately in love with betty since their childhood, but has always been too shy to confess his love to her. apart from being desperately in love, boris has some other problems, as the eccentric american mortician frank featherbed (christopher walken) has opened a funeral flourishing business in the same town... the film\\'s odd, very british wit should amuse everybody with a sense of humor, and the story sometimes becomes quite bizarre. also, \"plots with a view\" profits from a wonderful cast. brenda bethlyn, who has already proved herself to be a funny lady in 2000\\'s \"saving grace\", plays the lead, and she is once again very funny, and very lovable in her role. alfred molina, who plays her shy admirer, delivers a great performance as always, and robert pugh fits perfectly in the role of betty\\'s sleazy husband. beautiful naomi watts is also great as the husband\\'s \\'secretary\\', i\\'m becoming a bigger fan with every film i see her in. the greatest role, however, is played by the incomparable christopher walken (one of my favorite actors). walken is brilliant as he always is in the role of the eccentric mortician who arranges funerals that are quite unorthodox. overall, \"plots with a view\" is a vastly entertaining little british comedy that i highly recommend! i like many others saw this as a child and i loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood, i have been trying to find this movie and even been searching for it to play again on tv someday, since it originally played on usa networks. does anyone know where to buy this movie, or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me? also does anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on tv again? maybe all of us fans should write a station in hopes of them airing it again. i don\\'t think they did a good job of promoting this movie in the past because no one really knows about, people only know of the stepford wives and stepford husband movies. no one is familiar with the fact that there was a children version. maybe they should also do a re-make of it since they seem to be doing that a lot lately with a lot of my favorite old thriller/horror flicks. well if anyone has any input please i beg of you write me with information. thanks taira tcampo23@aol.com i am an actor,producer, director and what i am about to say are facts. this project was the worst film in movie making history. from producer to director and the edit of this so called film is a joke and i mean a big joke. why would blockbuster released such crap? i take my work very serious and this film is an insult to my profession. was the director trying to make a bad movie? i don\\'t think so. i seen bad zombie movies, but this takes the cake the coffie and everything on the damn table. this movie sucks!!! i really hate to talk bad about other filmmakers because i am one myself, but please consider in taking up a different profession. i respect the fact that you completed a movie, but i have to ask you \" were you smoking crack \", i mean the makeup on your girls, the scary zombies, what were you thinking. to the whole nation, if i could have voted zero i would have. worst film in movie making history!!! good movies are original, some leave a message or touch you in a certain way, but sometimes you\\'re not in the mood for that. i wanted something simple, no thinking just plain action when i watched this one. it started of good and was quite entertaining, so why a bad review. well in the end the movie lost it\\'s credibility. the storyline wasn\\'t that cheesy at all, the action was not too special but overall good, acting was ok, so more than enough to satisfy my needs. but all got ruined because things happened that were over the top, and it left me with a bad feeling. they should have put a little more effort in making everything credible and would have gotten a 7 in the \"no thinking just plain action\" category. so in conclusion if you know you\\'ll get irritated because things are happening that seem completely illogical: don\\'t watch! otherwise i\\'d say go ahead... its incredible to me that the best rendition of this amazing story remains a cartoon made by walt disney in the 1940s, but its true. here another clumsy attempt sputters confuses and alienates would be viewers with admirable effectiveness while successfully antagonizing those of us who have actually read the story. irving\\'s original work is short by any measure and making a feature length film is bound to be a challenge. one can either completely rewrite the story a la tim burton which is a discussion for another time, or pad the bust-line of the old girl with unintended detail. the latter is what is attempted here, and if i may say, pitifully so. unimaginative and thoroughly modern new facets to character personalities such as religious zealotry in crane or wanderlust in good old bram bones ruin the story\\'s intent and betray a severe lack of talent by the filmmakers. by the time the tale\\'s famous climax approached, i had completely lost interest. its the kind of film where you expect to see a stagehand smoking in the background. what a drawn out painful experience. that\\'s over two hours of my life i will never get back. this film festival director\\'s delight - is awash with overuse of the long slow shot....however - that\\'s not the only thing that makes a script. avoid this movie at all costs. well, i have not much to say about this film except that it was a truly wonderful film. natalie portman is absolutely fantastic as the daughter in this lovely mother-daughter relationship film. beautiful film. ladies and gentlemen, may we present the worst of all disney remakes. although the name of this movie is \"that darn cat\", it should have been \"that darn teen\" or \"fbi agent\". the cat didn\\'t get any real good scenes, ricci\\'s character was more annoying than funny, doug e. doug didn\\'t get any good lines, even dean jones\\'s cameo role couldn\\'t save this movie! the only really good characters were the town\\'s only two auto mechanics, but their scenes were only brief. in all, i\\'d say that if you are considering watching this movie, go get something more intelligent like a barney video. saw this movie and totally loved it the characters are great . it is definitely my kind of movie you do not get bored in this movie i love independent films they are so much more rewarding. my husband and i really enjoyed jay\\'s style. if you are an open minded person who loves thought provoking films and loves conversation after it\\'s over you will love this film. it is definitely thought provoking.the film definitely will step on some toes but who cares those people will probably not go to see this movie. it is amazing to see the characters evolve . jay floyd has really captured both sides of the table. applause applause jay i hope you are working on another movie. i waited for this movie to play in great anticipation. assuming it would be more accurately portrayed like the movie, \"the christmas box\" based on the book by richard paul evans. i sent out many emails to friends and family asking them to please watch this show, hoping they would better understand a tiny amount of my \"new\" life. after seeing this movie i was so disappointed. as a mother who lost her only child in november 2003 and really knowing the pain, i had hoped that this movie would shed light to parents who \"think\" they understand the grief a parent goes through who has lost a child. this movie was a very light hearted movie and the silliness of diane keaton was a slap in the face to parents who have buried a child. it was very unrealistic from start to stop. i had a few calls after the movie, each call the same, \"that was so off the mark and made it appear that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to songs on the radio and life is back\" what a bunch of bull! it is clear that the director and keaton have never lost a child because neither would have ever made the movie to be so off the mark. i guess that\\'s hollywood. have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of characters from beverly hills 90210 were thrown into a thai jail?if so, this is your movie. this is midnight express for the mtv crowd. that would be ok, but the story was poorly executed. contrived plot twists, poor dialogue and unresolved issues abound. this slight film did not earn the right to be as cryptic as it ends up being. potential spoiler and impossibly preposterous plot line-the faux tension filled moment when the hotel employee discovers the girls do not have a room there and is about to kick them out. (this moment is innappropriately played with the same solemnity and gravity as the moment when they are arrested at gunpoint). later the same hotel employee is somehow found-and bangkok is a big city, mind you, ive been there- and testifies against the girls, as if a couple of free mai tais warrant 40 years in prison. c\\'mon. rent another day in paradise instead. since there have been so many reviews of this fine film i will write in a list form and attempt to address issues that have not been discussed. 1. dana andrews was 38 during the filming of this movie. his character according to the screenplay was in his mid 20s. andrews, a highly underrated actor, did brilliantly play a character who was supposed to be much younger. 2. fredric march like all great actors needs at times to be restrained by the director to avoid over-the-top acting. he was mugging for the cameras when he was drunk on the night after his arrival and also the next morning when he was checking out his hang over in his mirror. 3. dana andrews was superb as he was in \"laura,\" \"the ox-bowl incident,\" \"a walk in the sun,\" \"the purple heart\" and many other films. why did fredric march win the academy award and why was dana andrews not even nominated for his outstanding performance? 4. harold russell gave the best performance i have ever seen by a non actor. 5. i realize this was the 1940s but dana andrews seemed to have no romantic interest in his exceptionally attractive wife (virginia mayo). 6. ray teal, who played the right wing bigot, years later became famous for portraying the sheriff on \"bonanza.\" 7. the professor from the south wrote that the film was slow moving, boring and poorly acted. the professor more than likely is uninformed about classic films. the beauty and significance of these ageless classics is that they are slow moving character studies that avoid profanity, excessive violence and gratuitous sex. ***i was surprised that zero out of 3 people found my review useful. alien was excellent. many writers tried to copy it. they all did a bad job (or almost). but dead space is the worst alien copy. because of the bad actors, the bad special effects, the bad scenario and other bad stuff (it would take about 3 pages to tell everything that is bad in this film. the movie wasn\\'t very long and this is a very good thing (the only one). you cannot laugh because it is too serious...that is a bad thing because, in almost each b-series sci-fi film, you can laugh during the whole time. it can be terrific sometimes, but instead of watching this stupidity, just watch alien or event horizon...these are much better!!! i give it 1 out of 5. ok, this doesn\\'t compare to the explosive tempo of the first part\\'s opening sequence; nor to its visual shock value; nor, for that matter, to the melancholic suspense of the second installment. no, it\\'s surprisingly and refreshingly different (apart, of course, from the two main actors). the tongue-in-cheek futuristic scenario drives the characters towards each other across genres and languages with an almost gravitational force. the moment of impact-conclusion is your choice of: a)shakespearean metaphor of life and humanity in a cartoon costume; b)sublimation of violence into homo-erotics; c)humorous detonation of an impossible buildup. everything up to then is even less unequivocal. highly recommended to indiscriminate movie buffs who don\\'t mind following foie gras with a hot dog; caution to those with more refined palates. this movie was a masterpiece of human emotions and experience. i think that a lot of people get caught up in leland\\'s apparent mental illness as the storyline, but i was drawn into the relationships of many of the characters and what they reveal about the force of human emotions. much of the message of the movie is that we never know the good without the bad, which is a little clichã©, but what makes this movie so good and so original is that it very eloquently portrays the crushing and devastating force that the bad can have, whether you see the bad everywhere like leland, or are experiencing the utter helplessness of unrequited love or a relationship that just isn\\'t going to work no matter how bad you want it to. this movie captures how helpless relationships and emotions can make you feel better than any movie i\\'ve seen, and it is as depressing a movie as it is good. the man who gave us splash, cocoon and parenthood gave us this incoherent muddle of cliched characters, poor plotting, you\\'ve-got-to-be-kidding dialogue and melodramatic acting? i guess everybody has a bad day at the office now and then. he\\'s allowed. there\\'s hardly anything at all to recommend this movie. chase masterson is always nice to look at and actually can act, though her role in this clunker is a waste. unfortunately the rest of the cast ranges from bad to mediocre. in a lot of films like this someone will shine through the material and you make a note of them for future reference. no such luck here. creature unknown\" a clichã©d monster-on-the-loose flick with the kids getting knocked off one after the other. the monster is a man in a rubber suit which hearkens back to the days of paul blaisdell. so bad it\\'s good! the rest of the show is just so bad it\\'s bad. a little humor might have made this more palatable, but everyone plays the deadly dull material straight up. there is a twist or two at the end, but by then you won\\'t care anymore. now here is a film that if made in australia would have easily been a comedy. sadly and annoyingly, here it is, flaccid and cheesy and overbaked from lala land. how did the di-erector get it so wrong? well, mainly by being serious about a job so hilariously startling that nobody in their right mind could take seriously. unless of course they were a nerdy lonely gay clichã© (but somehow cute)...or is that clichã© piled upon clichã©. no value in the story that almost seems like a prequel to gus van sant\\'s gerry..... and with a title like the fluffer how is it all such a lead weight? well this auteur must have soooooo mad that he didn\\'t get to burt and boogie first that he had to make his own. convoluted and undeveloped apart from the \\'unrequited love\\'s a bore\\' theme left over from a faded streisand lyric, we have only moody beefcake and tv serial level storyline left. the un necessary fourth act of this overlong turgid drama is truly terrible as the film wanders off like the gerries into to desert and gets stuck there. in oz in the late 90s some 20 somethings made a similar but actually hilarious film called moneyshot. originally filmed as the venus factory it too suffered from an auteur more awful than orson so they re-filmed half of it, got a ruthless tv editor to chop it up and down down to 72 minutes and hey-presto..comedy, tonight! a lesson there in when bad films turn good by lightening up. i guess the fluffer stiffed on release and after seeing it not perform, i can understand why. my interest in dorothy stratten caused me to purchase this video. although it had great actors/actresses, there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest. plus it just wasn\\'t that interesting. dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable. i was pretty disappointed in what i believe was one of audrey hepburn\\'s last movies. i\\'ll always love john ritter best in slapstick. he was just too pathetic here. the first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say the least. however it improved afterwards as the valentine party commenced. apart from the twist as to the identity of the killer in the very end, the hot bath murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie. the scene at the garden with kate was well shot and so was the very last scene (the \\'twist\\'). in those scenes, there was some genuine suspense and thrills and the hot bath murder scene had a nasty (the way slashers should be) edge to it. the earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore. i feel as though i know these people and have known people similar to them. these days, though, people are discouraged from showing such passion about anything especially love and loneliness. it has a slow beginning, but then look out! if you love romantic comedies, but would like to see one that had some basis in reality for a change {or at least did have back in the 70\\'s}, then you should see this movie! like a twisty country road, \"tough luck\" takes the viewer for a ride. there is nothing wrong with plot curves, as long as believability doesn\\'t fly out the window. unfortunately in the end the film does challenge an audience\\'s belief tolerance. nevertheless, it is easy to forgive this fault due to the superior acting, character development, and wonderful carnival atmosphere. do not expect to like any of the characters. armand asante, norman redus, and dagmara dominczyk, play shady con-artists, not exactly the type of person easily admired. the double crosses come fast and furious, and the final cross is a bit of a stretch. recommended. - merk has aged really well - still thrilling and suspenseful today. certainly one of hitch\\'s best movies. beautifully shot, with a great premise for suspense, sex-appeal provided by beautiful ruth roman. because of the great premise, you feel like you have to watch it to the end. if you find yourself losing faith in hitch and doubting his title as the master of suspense, i recommend this nice little movie as an antidote. 5 out of 5. they should have named this movie ...blonde women that needed to get their roots colored. also the main character, geeze, the too tight sweaters. the giggling. thought the guy did a good job though. i keep hoping we\\'ll find a good 8 star christmas movie to watch this week. the dart throwing. had to laugh at that too. we\\'ve still got 3 more on the dvr to watch, maybe we\\'ll get lucky. oh yeah, i figured the guy out pretty quickly and nailed it when he picked up the flowers and then drove out with his cousin. i told my daughter they were on their way to the cemetery. and how stupid was it that the two gals followed them there spying on them? creepy. this is one of the best movies. it is one of my favorites. a movie with good acting. the story is very sensitive and touching. good camera work also. the names of the actresses and actors are not at the top of the american star list. however, they give equal or better performances than the top of the list. it is such a pleasure to see a movie about true love, romance, friendship without having to endure watching someone having to kick-box their way to save the world. if you don\\'t like this movie then you have no heart or feelings. then go watch a sports movie. there is no killing or horror here. see the movie. it is a must. th \"bell book and candle\" was shown recently on cable. not having seen it for a while, we decided to take another look at this comedy. based on the james van druten\\'s broadway hit, which was a vehicle for rex harrison and lilli palmer in the early fifties, the film was adapted for the screen by daniel taradash. the film was directed by richard quine, who turned the play into a delightful comedy. evidently, judging by some of the comments submitted by imdb, the big issue seems to be the pairing of the two stars, who had collaborated on \"vertigo\", released the same year. movie audiences didn\\'t think anything about the age difference when this film was released. in fact, most of the aging male stars of that period were always involved with much younger women. the film set in manhattan during christmas is a delightful comedy that has enchanted viewers. kim novak was at the height of her beauty as it\\'s clear the camera adored her no matter what was she playing. as the witch that becomes human, her gillian is charming. james stewart, who plays the publisher shep\\' henderson, is also seen at his best. mr. stewart was an excellent comedy actor who shows in here why he was at the top. in supporting roles the wonderful elsa lanchester, playing queenie, is a welcome addition to any movie, as she proves here. jack lemmon\\'s nicky holroyd, the brother of gillian, is also good. ernie kovacs is also seen as the writer sidney radlitch. this is an excellent way to spend a winter night at home watching \"bell book and candle\". it is very hard to come up with new information about jfk jr. and this fine movie had very little of it, but it was a joy to watch. the casting was very good and the script, while somewhat like a documentary, was also good. my only complaint was that it wasn\\'t long enough. perhaps a two-part movie could have told us more about his \"pre-george\" days and his relationships with his mother, sister, and other relatives. some of the material in the book, \"american son,\" by richard blow would have enhanced the movie a lot. wtbs should be applauded for producing such an entertaining movie. this entire movie is worth watching just for the magnificent final moment - its the best ending of any movie i\\'ve ever seen. perfect, beautiful, funny, simply wonderful. i found this movie delightful, even with it\\'s french taking-itself-too-seriously deep meanings thing going on. i loved it - it\\'s a great love story. and i loved the way algerians were woven in - and by the way, the music during the final credits is great. i want the cd! granted, this seems like a good idea. steve martin, goldie hawn, and john cleese in a neil simon comedy. where can you go wrong? watch the movie, and you\\'ll find out. in truth, martin, the lead, is mis-cast. he\\'s not doing the great slapstick he\\'s known for, from movies like \"the jerk\", but instead plays a sort of in-between character that doesn\\'t work. hawn, with no one to play off of, is terrible. cleese is the only even partially funny member. to top it off, the plot is pretty stupid. i can\\'t say how much of it may have been changed, but the characters seem to lack the slightest bit of common sense. they blunder through new york, not doing anything right, and unfortuneatly, nothing funny. not only is the whole premise completely unbelievable, it seems to give the message that people who don\\'t live in new york aren\\'t very bright, a theme repeated throughout the movie. in summation, instead of seeing this, go rent the original \"odd couple\" again. halloween 666 (1995) the producer\\'s cut review! halloween 666 starts of with a recap of the horrific ending to part five. if you thought the last chapter was dark, this one will really blow your mind. a mysterious \"man in black\" has raided the haddonfield police department freeing micheal myers. in the process poor jamie lloyd was abducted by strange cultists. what they want with her? who knows, but let\\'s just say her long suffering will end soon. doctor loomis is back spending the rest of his twilight years trying to stop michael myers from killing any more innocents (good luck). a friend of loomis, doctor wynn comes back after a four sequel hiatus to help the good doctor. another old face from part one guest stars as well. this dark and dreary sequel was dismantled during the post production editing. for some reason the distributors felt that the final product wasn\\'t worth the average horror film watcher\\'s time. so they decide to dumb it down. then after having the film sit on the shelf for several months it laid an egg at the box office. no matter what they did to the film, they made it worse. they should have left well enough alone. hey, the film company knows better than the filmmakers now....don\\'t they? producer\\'s cut :highly recommended released version: not recommended definitely a \"must see\" for all fans of film noir. thanks to a fine script and crisp, razor sharp direction a top cast comes together and works like a well oiled clock to produce a crackerjack psychological thriller. wonderful characterizations articulate the movie\\'s powerful message of racial and religious tolerance. it\\'s difficult and almost unjust to single out any one particular performance because there isn\\'t a weak link in the entire company but robert ryan as the hateful and violent white supremacist is truly spine chilling. making this film in the 1940s would have taken a lot of courage. now,all these years later, at a time when contemporary movies are dominated by a ridiculous over abundance of foul language, bare breasts, crummy acting and deafening soundtracks it\\'s refreshing to get back to the basics of quality film making with a viewing treat like \"crossfire\". another low budget gem from the hollywood archives . i rented this movie on the merits of what the trailer showed, and of course sir anthony hopkins. if jackson pollack teamed up with david lynch, and timothy leary to make a movie, this would be the end result. i don\\'t think i\\'ve seen a movie like it that made an lsd trip look like an episode of sesame street. it\\'s a bunch of set pieces where the characters flash in and out of reality, or various realities, and the film doesn\\'t culminate into anything until the last 5 minutes, where all of a sudden it makes sense. i wrote a scathing review on my movie review blog that essentially gives everything away, and i won\\'t do that here. it\\'s a well acted piece of cinema, and the soundtrack was written by sir anthony hopkins, and let me say this, if there\\'s one redeeming feature to this film, it\\'s the music. it fits perfectly. some of the dialogue is unbelievably good, and unbelievably bad all at the same time. i enjoyed parts of this movie, i truly did, and once you get to the end of it, you\\'ll actually figure out what\\'s truly going on. it\\'s unfortunate that you have to wade through 2 hours of crazy to get to a salient point, which minimizes the effect of the entire movie. i give it a 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that the real problem with this film isn\\'t the acting, it\\'s everything. if you are a traveller, if there is a fire burning into your heart, if you\\'d call \"home\" every place on earth, but none of them can give you enough, if you are always looking for the next thing and if you believe the other part of your soul is somewhere out there, see this movie and you\\'ll find out a little, but wonderful, piece of life sitting next to you. what are forest whitaker and clifton collins jr. doing in this? light it up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece on problems in low income area schools. while the topic is one that needs to be addressed, the film uses every cliche in the genre and comes off as a textbook popcorn flick. the characters are cutouts from the inner city version of the breakfast club or even the faculty. watch this with your children when they turn 13 or 14. with them, it could be an outlet for a lesson on current social problems. for anyone older, it will be nothing more than something to watch and spit on at 4 in the morning, as i did recently on bravo. matter of fact, what was this doing on bravo? there are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how i felt about this film so ill keep it short. \"the grinch\" i thought was marvellous - jim carrey is a truly talented, physical comedian as well as being a versatile clever actor (in my opinion). mike myers on the other hand gets his laughs by being annoying. i used to like him very much in his \"waynes world\" and \"so i married an axe murderer\" days - but ive never been fond of austin powers and \"the cat in the hat\" has just finished me off. this film was horrible - the gags were horrible! inappropriate for children not only in adult content but in the fact that some of them were so dated they havent amused anyone for 50 years! the plot was messy, messy, messy! its a shame really because the children were very likeable as was \"mom\". they probably could have picked a better villain than alec baldwin - but he could have pulled it off if it weren\\'t for myers ugly, revolting over-acted portrayal of the cat. i mean - did myers even glance at a script? was one written? the other actors seemed to have one - but the cat just seemed to be winging it! on the other hand i would like to mention that the sets and props were marvellous!!! but unfortunately they cant save this film. poor dr seuss - the man was a genius! dont ruin his reputation by adapting his work in a such a lazy, messy way!!! 1/10 i\\'m surprised about the many female voters who even give this film better marks. my thought about this film was that the target audience is adult and male. whipped and tortured women, merciless revenge and a high body count are typical ingredients, introduced into film history by the spaghetti subgenre. the opening and the hand-smashing are django rip-offs. the shooter however lacks the style of e.g. django. score, acting and cinematography are mediocre at best but if you look for the above mentioned ingredients you are in the right place here. and the actors don\\'t have an italian accent. 4 / 10. matthau and lemmon are at their very best in this one - everyone else in the movie are also great. the dialogue is excellent and very, very witty - and the scene where lemmon\\'s character attempts to clear out his sinuses in a restaurant have me rolling on the floor with laughter every time i see it. anyone who happened to see the not so great sequel should not be turned away from the original. i recommend this wonderful movie to everyone - i just love it. and the fact the jack lemmon plays his character so straight forward with tragic overtones only adds to the hilariousness in my opinion. these two great guys made a string of movies together, but this one is the best - no doubt. this is an incredible film. i can\\'t remember the last time i saw a swedish movie this layered. it\\'s funny, it\\'s tragic, it\\'s compelling, and most of all it\\'s a slice of swedish small town life. it crushes the clichã©s, and dwells deeper. it makes you feel connected, not only to the main characters, but to all the characters. big city girl tracing back to her roots, her small hometown, to celebrate her father\\'s 70th birthday, crossing paths with people she hasn\\'t met in several years. although the story itself isn\\'t unique, it offers a fresh approach. the center of the story is the relationship between three sisters (on different stages in life), who aren\\'t very close. or at least don\\'t realize how close they are. one key reason that makes it so easy to connect to the people in this film is the immaculate cast. first, i\\'m more than pleased about the fact that there are absolutely no so-called \\'a-list\\' swedish actors in this film. usually there is a handful of actors that has the ability to find their way into almost every major production in sweden. this time the production company managed to keep it real by casting actors who actually seem to love their profession. sofia helin is probably the first swedish actress since eva rã¶se to prove that you don\\'t need words to convey an emotion. the writing is also very appealing. the dialogue is more than believable, and compared with other swedish films from the past year or two, it\\'s ahead by miles. maria blom controls everything from the beginning, and if you didn\\'t know, you would never guess that this is her first time writing and directing a feature length film. i can\\'t wait for her next one. once you start watching this, you really want to see it through. just how bad? well, compared to this movie, cannibal holocaust is citizen kane. there\\'s the stilted acting, the atrocious dialogue, the half baked plot and like its companion piece way too much in the way of on screen animal slaughter that was actually done. unlike holocaust, ferox is a straight forward movie. it doesn\\'t pretend to be a pseudo documentary. in some ways that helps the production in that the film is very sharp and crisp compared to holocaust\\'s graininess. unfortunately, we are once again given a group of people who are morally reprehensible. they torture the natives and essentially bring everything that they get upon themselves. there\\'s really nothing in this film that makes it worth your while. i was fairly lenient with my review of holocaust due to some actual attempt at a statement and style, but in ferox\\'s case there is no reason to watch this unless you solely get off on blood and gore. some of the secondary actors try, really hard. and camera shots in the desert are quite lovely. otherwise, this film is horrible. william shatner\\'s character, harvey, is an amateur screenwriter. he\\'s also a psychopath, a man who quite literally escapes from a mental institution. is the point of this film that amateur screenwriters are psychopaths? harvey will do anything to get his script read and turned into a movie, even if that means taking a film crew hostage. do amateur screenwriters ... grovel? maybe they do. the film\\'s setup is way too long. we don\\'t get to the point of the story until well into the second half. the first half darts and flits among assorted characters. \"shoot or be shot\" is touted as a comedy, but i found it totally not funny. dialogue contains no subtext. none of the characters are believable as real people. they\\'re all stick figures that perform \"action\" in a way that resembles cartoon characters. indeed, the film is basically a cartoon for adults: silly, inane, birdbrained. i can understand why some actors are in this film. they need the money or the exposure. but what are insiders shatner and harry hamlin doing here? maybe shatner wants more comedy roles. is this the best he can do? is hamlin that desperate for money? he used to be a respected actor. what happened? even though the story is supposed to be a satire, it comes across more as a put-down of amateur screenwriters. maybe that wasn\\'t the intent. but that\\'s certainly how the film can be interpreted. as such, the script was very, very poorly written. this movie is simply bad. first of all the story is just weird and it\\'s not good written. it leaves you with questions when you\\'re finished. sometimes that\\'s ok, but not in this case. the acting is nothing to write home about. the adults does a ok job, but the kids, taken in consideration they are kids, does not a good job. i thought the lead role, ian costello as mickey, was worst. well, to be honest i\\'m not sure that was the lead role. never quite figured who this movie was about. mickey or pete. there were some shots that stood out, but over all there were nothing exiting about the cinematography. the sound, however, was better. there was a nice score. a little adventure kind of score, though this didn\\'t look like an adventure film to me. it had some elements of an adventure film, but it was more of a drama. however, it was hard to tell who this film was meant for. children? hardly. there is too much language and violence for that. adults? i don\\'t know. it had to many elements of a children\\'s movie in it. it was like a adult movie in a children movie wrapping. the story was just weird. i don\\'t have much of an idea of what it really was about. you was thrown right in to it without knowing anything, but there were all the time references to something you felt you should know. the fact that the children\\'s parents were dead for instance and that mickey blamed pete for it. you expected to get to know what happened , but you never got. all together this movie was bad and a waste of time. there was no drive in it. nothing to really move the story forward. this is not what you spend your saturday night on. though not hal hartley\\'s best work (my personal favorite is \"surviving desire\"), there is still much to like about this movie, especially for fans of hartley\\'s dialogues. even to audiences new to hartley, i would definitely recommend this movie over the sophomoric \"dogma.\" this movie is more intelligent, truer to its source material (the bible), and more fun than any of the other pre-millennium apocalypse movies. this movie is actually part of the french \"2000 as seen by.\" (2000 par vu) series; as such, it is perhaps even a lower-budget film than hartley\\'s other works. while the need for simple scenes shot with digital camera is understandable in this context, the main problem with this movie is the unfortunate overuse of the blurry/jittery effect. i\\'d be happy to never see this effect used in a movie again; especially at the beginning, it almost makes the movie unwatchable. but overlook this flaw, and you\\'ll be treated to a fine film. especially notable is magdalena (played by p.j. harvey) relating how jesus saved her from being stoned to death; a short scene i found surprisingly moving. (despite the fact that it was not mary magdalene that this happened to; the woman in the bible was unnamed.) i bought this (it was only $3, ok?) under the title \"grey matter\". the novelty of seeing sherriff roscoe in a non-dukesofhazzard role intrigued me. as the other reviewers warned, it\\'s a pretty boring tale of a top secret government experiment gone awry. and yes, there are plenty of establishing shots, especially of a house with a pool in front of it. some of the characters and interiors are so nondescript i guess the filmmakers worried we might forget who is who, so they keep tipping us off by first showing the outside of the buildings. it\\'s actually kinda funny. after awhile the pool shot feels like a tv channel\\'s station identification logo, reminding us that we are watching \"grey matter\". i also enjoyed two bouts of name-calling. at one point an angry test subject taunts somebody in charge by calling her a \"scientific b*tch!\". it\\'s just a very inadequate insult. several scenes later a different subject lets off steam by muttering about that \"scientific b**tard!\". it just sounded very awkward to me. someday this movie will disappear forever. another decade from now it will likely be impossible to find any copies of it. almost like it never happened. there is a bit of trivia which should be pointed out about a scene early in the movie where homer watches the attempt of december 6, 1957 (at least that was the video used on the tv he was watching) which showed the vangard launch attempt, which failed. he is next shown reading or dictating a letter to dr. von braun offering condolences about the failure. von braun was at marshall space flight center in huntsville working for the army. the vanguard project was by the early nasa team which was at what soon became goddard space flight center. the army rushed the jupiter-c, which was essentially a us made v2 technology, but worked to launch a satellite in response to russia\\'s success with sputnik. this error may have actually been made by homer, because of the notoriety of von braun, but his team didn\\'t have their attempt fail. in fact the underlying redstone was flying from 52 and was the first us man rated booster, used for shepard\\'s sub orbital flight, as well as grissom\\'s. this is why this sort of movie is so good, as it hopefully will inspire people to read up and spot these bits of trivia, and in the process see what has been done, and be inspired to do more. i enjoyed this movie very much. kristy swanson omar epps, and ice cube were all great in it. the movie dealt with many issues, and i didn\\'t know if i was going to like it, but singelton did a terrific job of creating characters that you really cared about. 52-pick up never got the respect it should have. it works on many levels, and has a complicated but followable plot. the actors involved give some of their finest performances. ann-margret, roy scheider, and john glover are perfectly cast and provide deep character portrayals. notable too are vanity, who should have parlayed this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability she shows, and kelly preston, who\\'s character will haunt you for a few days. anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this. teenage exorcist is one of those god-awful films to video that makes the viewer give up any expectations of decent entertainment for low brow sexual antics, adolescent humour, and empty writing. this film delivers exactly what its was trying to deliver. it is about a girl moving into a house where a baron de sade(hmmm) once lived and finally being drawn to him through her own inner demon. her sister and brother-in-law, along with an irish priest, her boyfriend, and a pizza delivery boy, try to save her and exorcise her demon. well, not much here in way of horror or suspense. in fact, one line from the film pretty much sums up what to expect. mike(the girl\\'s brother-in-law) has tied her(the name is diane by the way and she is played by brinke stevens) up after trying to chainsaw her sister. he removes a gag from her mouth and says something like, \"this won\\'t be the last gag we see tonight.\" indeed, it was not. the special effects are cheesy and poorly crafted, and the film makes use of this by playing on its comedic appeal. some of the lines and situations are funny. robert quarry, old count yorga himself, really steals his scenes as an irish priest. he hams it up wailing biblical verses and crooning irish songs. you know you are in trouble, however, when eddie deezen gets top billing. deezen does his schtick and has a couple nice moments as well, but the material is just too threadbare than to be anything more than teenage sophomoric time filler. michael berryman, from the hills have eyes, also has a brief but interesting cameo in the film. as for the other thespians, well, they are all pretty good at being pretty mediocre. stevens is lovely in fishnet stockings and french-cut panties, but beyond that don\\'t expect too much more from her. her sister is played by elena sahagun, and she shows a bit more than brinke(a very lovely young lady by the way) and out acts brinke by miles. her husband, played by jay richardson shows off his ability to act and be funny amidst mediocrity. again, not a bad film to waste a little time that involves no thinking on. if you are a robert quarry fan, watch it for his performance at the very least. wenders was great with million $ hotel.i don\\'t know how he came up with this film! the idea of giving the situation after spt11 and the view of american society is hopeful,that makes it 2 out of ten.but this is not a movie.is that the best someone can do with a great idea(the west-east clash).there are important things going on in middle east and it is just issued on the screen of a mac* with the fingers of an amerian girl who is actually at the level of stupidity(because she is just ignorant about the facts).the characters are not well shaped.and the most important thing is the idea that is given with religion is somehow funny to me.at the ending scene lana says lets just be quiet and try to listen.and the background music says \"...i will pray\".the thing is not about religion actually.but it ends up with this.how you are gonna see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray.the lights are already shining on the truth.its just that nobody wants to see it. ps: \"my home is not a place.it is people\"the only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that sentence.but it is wasted behind this film making. (by the way; as \"someone\" mentioned below ,americas finest young man are not finest,they are just the \"poor\" and the \"hopeless\" ones who sign up for the army in need of good paychecks which is not provided by the government ! ) as a low budget enterprise in which the filmmakers themselves are manufacturing and distributing the dvds themselves, we perhaps shouldn\\'t expect too much from broken in disc form. and yet what\\'s most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with enough extras to shame a james cameron dvd and a decidedly fine presentation. with regards to the latter, the only major flaw is that broken comes with a non-anamorphic transfer. otherwise we get the film in its original 1.85:1 ratio, demonstrating no technical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected. indeed, given ferrari\\'s hands on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a fact. the same is also true of the soundtrack. here we are offered both dd2.0 and dd5.1 mixes and whilst i\\'m uncertain as to which should be deemed the \"original\", the fact that ferrari had an involvement in both means neither should be considered as inferior. indeed, though the dd5.1 may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience owing to the manner in which it utilizes the score, both are equally fine and free of technical flaws. as for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them. take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and you\\'ll notice numerous commentaries, loads of featurettes and various galleries. indeed, given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute chunks rather than compiled into a lengthy documentary, there really is little to discuss. the \\'anatomy of a stunt\\' featurette, for example, is exactly what it claims to be, and the same goes for the rest of pieces. as such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of broken\\'s pre-production, production and post-production. and whilst it may have been preferable to find them in a more easily digestible overall \\'making of\\', in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to view. of the various pieces, then, it is perhaps only the commentaries which need any kind of discussion. then again, there\\'s also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks. the one involving the actors is overly jokey and doesn\\'t take the film too seriously. ferrari\\'s pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing. and the technical ones are, well, extremely technical. of course, we also get some crossover with what\\'s been covered elsewhere on the discs, but at only 19 minutes none of these pieces outstay their welcome. indeed, all in all, a fine extras package. child \\'sexploitation\\' is one of the most serious issues facing our world today and i feared that any film on the topic would jump straight to scenes of an explicitly sexual nature in order to shock and disturb the audience. after having seen both \\'trade\\' and \\'holly\\', one film moved me to want to actually see a change in international laws. the other felt like a poor attempt at making me cry for five minutes with emotive music and the odd suicide. i do not believe that turning this issue into a hollywood tear jerker is a useful or necessary strategy to adopt and i must commend the makes of \\'holly\\' for engaging subtly but powerfully with the terrible conditions these children are sadly forced to endure. \\'trade\\' wavered between serious and stupid with scenes involving the death of a cat coming after images that represented children being forced to commit some horrendous acts. i found this unengaging and at times offensive to the cause. if i had wanted a cheap laugh i would not have signed up for a film on child trafficking. for anyone who would like to watch a powerful film that actually means something i would suggest saving the money on the cinema ticket for the release of \\'holly\\'. i will not say much about this film, because there is not much to say, because there is not much there to talk about. the only good thing about this movie is that our favorite characters from \"atlantis: the lost empire\" are back. several of the bad things about this movie are that it has horrible characters, it has horrible comedy, horrible animation, and james arnold taylor trying to copy the wonderful, one and only michael j. fox as milo james thatch. the reasons for my criticisms are that all the characters are changed into something that they never were, and never should be, animation that has been downgraded to the lowest extent possible, and finally, why would somebody who did wonderful voice-over work for obi-wan kenobi in \"clone wars\" want to copy michael j. fox? i happen to have an answer to this. because they are the same person who thought he had to copy eddie murphy from mulan in mulan ii. yes, sadly, it is true. . whoa. in the twin cities, we have a station that shows a \"big bad movie\" monday through friday. tonight\\'s nugget was a film with carrie fisher called \"she\\'s back\" about a really annoying woman who ends up getting murdered when thugs break into her house. bea (beatrice) comes back to haunt her husband. she wants him to seek revenge on her killers, hence \"she\\'s back\". and she won\\'t let him rest until he does so. she irritates him endlessly... and the viewers, too! this movie is truly one of the worst movies i\\'ve ever seen. hey, i like bad movies, though (my fave movie is xanadu). i was really shaking my head throughout the whole film, wondering who thought this would be a good idea for a movie. bea is just so annoying. the plot is silly; the acting is bad; the story... well, you get my drift. anyway, if you wanna see a really bad movie - really really bad movie, check this one out. you won\\'t be disappointed. heh. although i am a fan of heather thomas and i have a few of her old bikini posters around here somewhere, i can honestly say that if the only movie i had ever seen her in was \"cyclone\", i would never be able to guess why she had made it as far as she had in show business. directed by fred olen ray (about as good an omen as seeing buzzards circle over head in the desert), this tale of a woman (thomas) who must protect a high-tech motorcycle from unscrupulous types is about as \"b\" movie as it gets (or in fred olen\\'s case, \"b minus\"). the cast itself should tell you something. it\\'s not every movie that combines thomas with actors the calibre of beswick, hall, combs, donahue, tamblyn and landau (!!). if you\\'re lucky, very few movies do. and even though they seem to be having fun, shouldn\\'t some of that fun be passed on to the audience? i vote yes, seems they voted no. of course, if you ever wanted to see heather deliver an uppercut to another woman, use the \"f\" word and get hooked up to battery cables, you\\'ve probably been looking for this one. myself, i\\'ll be content with old \"fall guy\" reruns. one star, given in hopes that when another \"cyclone\" hits town, heather runs for shelter. i know i will. i am surprised so few have good words for this movie. for its time (the 80\\'s) it was a very entertaining and engaging story. casting was good. story was good. special effects were remarkable for the time period. deserving of an 8/10. seeing this film, or rather set of films, in my early teens irrevocably changed my idea of the possibilities of human interaction and the range of potential experience. this monumental exploration of individuals, and their historical setting, reveals how full bodied and intense every human existence is. the people are portrayed as they are to themselves: their experiences of the smallest to the largest internal and external phenomena are detailed with the greatest of artistry and perception. edgar reitz displays a fabulous appreciation of human motivations and longings. when these phenomena are set against the immense time allowed by the length of the work, one cannot help but apprehend the force and vivacity of happiness, defeat, lust, love, sadness, melancholy, that each person feels. when i saw these films i perceived my future experiences, how my life would inevitably twist and oscillate due to both intended and accidental events. i acquired a feeling of the longevity of being and what it meant to reflect upon past lives, memories and contexts. a masterpiece and a revelation. i only wish the bbc would screen it again. if anyone knows where i can get a copy, could they contact me not the film to see if you want to be intellectually stimulated. if you want to have a lot of fun a the theater, however, this is the one. lots of snappy banter(and some really cheesy banter, too). mos def and seth green are very funny as the comic relief. exciting and creative heists and chase scenes. mark wahlberg and charlize theron(sexy)are appealing leads. and donald sutherland! this is one of the worst films i\\'ve seen for years. the storyline has potential that is never realized. the actors are a poor choice, but considering the screen writing, their talent isn\\'t wasted. i really wanted everyone dead as quickly as possible so i could get out and watch something else. unfortunately, i did stay to the end and had a laugh at the murmurs of people moaning about how crappy this is. there wasn\\'t booing, after all, this is england, just gentle moans about how crap that was. then, i look on imdb and see 288 people have given it 10 out of 10. i really just cannot see how those people are able to give that score. they must be a pr company working with the distributor. there\\'s a hilarious set problem towards the end of the film, when in the graveyard and the hick attacks, look out for the dodgy scenery that rocks when touched (supposed to be a brick wall) - the blood effects are waaaay ott - the film feels like everyone is making a spoof horror except the director. wealthy widower anthony steffen (as alan cunningham) is a sadomasochistic lover, and british lord. he brings sexy red-haired women to his castle, where he whips and murders them. black-booted stripper erika blanc (as susie) gets away, temporarily. mr. steffen is haunted by wife \"evelyn\", who died in childbirth. as therapy, he decides to marry again, after meeting pretty blonde marina malfatti (as gladys). by the end of the movie, they will have had to dig a few more graves. \"the night evelyn came out of the grave\" is great title, at least. ** la notte che evelyn uscã¬ dalla tomba (1971) emilio miraglia ~ anthony steffen, marina malfatti, erika blanc this is the worst movie i have seen for years! it starts ridicoulus and continues in the same way. i thnik when is something going to happen in this film,,,, and the the acting is worse. the ending lifts it a bit and saves the movie from a total flop. mark wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie. sorry tim burton batman was good but this one sucks. at a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious, on first viewing i\\'m kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with \\'shaun of the dead\\'. now, given i view simon pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius, i realise this is a rather big claim. and to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether \\'fido\\' will appeal to you. in a way the comedy picks up where \\'shaun\\' left off, except we\\'re back in the original 1950s living dead-era stereotypical middle-american small town. the zombie wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well-adjusted, useful members of the community. this, so we\\'re informed at the outset, is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at zomcom - a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps? the beauty of the film lies in its dead-pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose. the charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect. themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through - the veneer of good clean living, keeping up appearances, repressed emotion, muddled parental values, social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual. it\\'s a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the film\\'s all-round strong cast. it\\'s one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part. it\\'s also fun imagining what billy connelly learning his script must have been like... so in conclusion, it is probable you will appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you. ugh. even the ever-popular diane lane could not save this movie, and the most exciting thing about the movie was seeing if rourke\\'s face would move. one has heard so much \"gossip\" about his botched face lift, etc., so like an accident on the side of the road, we just had to slow down and see the wreck. the plot was thin. here we have a very professional mob hit man who somehow latches on to a wild and uncontrollable punk/crook, and throughout this movie we\\'re wondering why this guy stays with this idiot, let alone gets together with the guy in the first place. then the crime that was not even committed has the pro to go after the witnesses. he would have popped them right then and there. but then, we would not have had a movie then, would we? and why did the realtor even agree to the extortion? there were more holes in this flick than in my colander. the acting was horrid, the entire movie predictable down to the minute, and even the ending. and so much could have been done to make this a much better movie. but if you have about 90 minutes to kill and not have to use any brain cells in the process, then this movie is just what the doctor ordered. how disney can you get? preppy rich girls act like idiots, buy a bunch of stuff, and get taught a lesson. is disney trying to send a lesson to itself? that maybe while buying everything it should maybe still be human? whatever the psycho-analysis, this movie sucked. the girls want a rich party for their rich lives. but then money disappears and they have to use their riches to get the milk plant (yes, milk) going to employ the workers. they keep it afloat until daddy comes home. and the man at the beginning, who appears to be the one that takes the money, is the one. but the ending is dumb. webcam in the cayman islands? huh? not worth my time ever again. but it is better than howl\\'s moving castle. \"d-\" if this film is examined closely, it\\'s a bit sad. it is detailed enough to touch upon very real problems children, who grow up in poor, dysfunctional environments. yet, it retains it\\'s comedic value, with spirited performances by diahann carroll and james earl jones. the sadness lies in the struggles and dysfunction of the mother (carroll), who cannot truly help her children, not because she doesn\\'t want to, or try, but because, it\\'s obvious she doesn\\'t know how. remember, this is a comedy, but if you\\'ve never seen this, or if you have, watch this film and see the humanity, in the characters. good film. i happen to run into this movie one night so i decided to watch it! i was very pleased with the movie... i thought it was a wonderful plot. it\\'s a great feeling knowing a deceased one has come back and you get that second chance to say what you want to say! and this wife stayed devoted for 23 years!!! i thought it was a great movie!! i went to see this film because joaquim de almeida was in it. joaquim had a fairly small part, so it was good that i liked the film on it\\'s own. in fact, i liked it a lot! the film centers around two characters, albert and louie. albert is a shy, retiring sort, and louie... well louie is not. the story revolves around louie\\'s request to albert to let him come over to albert\\'s place for just a little while. louie has just gotten out of prison. albert and louie have known each other since childhood, and of course whenver they do something together there is trouble and it\\'s albert who always takes the fall. the action of the film is based on the adventures that ensue from louie\\'s visit. on the run is a chronicle of mad-cap, zany, situations. however, bruno de almeida and scriptwriter, joseph minion (after hours), don\\'t always take you where you expect to go. there are twists and turns that add depth to this film. of course there is plenty of outright comedy, but there is much subtle humor here as well. there are some downright good performances here as well. albert is played delightfully by michael imperioli. he\\'s getting fairly well-knownthese days from the hbo series, the sopranos. louie is played by john ventimiglia, who imbues his character with a lovable, child-like quality. (no matter what he does, you just gotta love louie!). both these actors are excellent in their individual characters. with imperioli, you\\'ll want to hug him and bring him home to mom. ventimiglia, well, you won\\'t know whether you should slap him or bring him home (and not to mom!).<p> there are other stand-out performances as well. the character of rita is played by drena deniro (yes, robert\\'s daughter). the audience adored her. in talking with the others who saw the film it was fun to discuss whether it was albert or louie who was their favorite of those two. but, everyone loved rita! is this film perfect? no, i can\\'t say that it is. there were many times i wished the director had had a bigger budget to work with. there were some scenes that cried out for more budgetary freedom. (give this guy a decent budget to work with and i believe you are going to see a film that will make you stand up and notice.) the ending sequence was a bit of a victim of budget. yet, budget or no budget, the ending screen shot, in my opinion, brought together the talent of actor and director into a memorable, emotionally effective scene. \"yes, georgio\" is a light-hearted and enjoyable movie/comedy that contains beautiful settings and beautiful music. it\\'s not my favorite movie but it is a movie i have enjoyed seeing more than once. some reviewers suggested if one wished to enjoy pavarotti, they would likely be better served by picking up an opera dvd. although, a full opera might be a better representation of pavarotti\\'s operatic talents, oftentimes, an opera requires costumes and has story lines that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person. \"yes, georgio\" permits pavarotti to use his speaking voice and to exhibit a personality and character in ways an opera would not. many reviewers seemed to find the story unbelievable; i don\\'t agree. enormously talented people can be both self-centered and charming - charming enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people. additionally, people who are very different from one other often gain insights about themselves and grow in positive ways from interacting with people who stretch them or take them in directions they might not have chosen on their own. both georgio and pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves in relationship with the other. relax and let yourself go into a visually and aurally rewarding film with pavarotti at the peak of his vocal abilities. the ending scenes from puccini\\'s turandot alone are worth the time to get there. this gem for gore lovers is extremely underrated. it\\'s pure delight and fun! gratuitous servings of blood, insanity and black humor, which can please even the most demanding lover of the genre. a full exploitation of the almost universal fear of dentists and flawlessly shot. only for the connoisseurs. i had nothing to do before going out one night so i didn\\'t want to watch anything too heavy, i picked the perfect film. this must have been a gift to barrymore from someone she slept with, the director raja gosnell has made nothing but silly crap and the writing on this one is just atrocious. in what high school can you register without a parent present and no proof of age or former schooling? they let kids all come to the prom with no shirts, in skin tight leotards, ass shorts and one girl was dressed as eve wearing only fig leaves? she announces that she\\'s 25 and her brother is 23 but there is no reprisal from the school, parents or lawsuits of any kind against the newspaper for fraud or spying? the newspaper boss wants to catch the teacher in an underage sex scandal but doesn\\'t realize the teacher is coming on to a 25 year old so any case would be entrapment? they allow a camera in and record peoples private conversations with under age kids? i wonder if i hired my younger sister to go back to hs with a camera on her and filmed under age girls for my personnel use i would not get in some kind of trouble??? nahhhh no problem. didn\\'t she have to take gym or go to the bathroom at some point? the secondary characters in this were like cardboard cutouts of what high school students are thought to be and everybody was a stereotype. jessica alba is just embarrassingly bad in this mugging for the camera at every chance. in what world do the parents not get suspicious when their uber-geeky daughter is miraculously asked out by the school stud to the prom? and they don\\'t ask the guy inside to meet him like every other parent in history. if some guy in my school or any other school for that matter had conned my sister and thrown eggs at her in her prom dress he would have been in a body cast for the rest of his life. this movie is so contrived and predictable it\\'s nauseating, and why at the end is everybody (the alpo girls included) cheering for this chick when two days before they hated her???? dumb, dumb and dumb. ... but had to see just how bad it could get. the plotline was thin to begin with, but it just kept getting worse. a female genetic engineering grad student uses her research on accelerated mitosis to artificially create a male, because a biological weapon used in ww3 killed off 97% of the worldwide male population. the surviving men are either high prices gigolos in back alley clubs, or crazed lunatics in run down football stadiums plotting to overthrow the \\'lesbian conspiracy\\'. the entire process resembled the microwaving of a large bowl of jello. press a few buttons and ding you get a baby. not only that, but he will age to mid 20\\'s in a month, and then begin to age normally (how convenient). eventually poor adam gets bored with the secluded cabin in the woods where his creator had raised him and steals her car to \\'see the city\\'. this begins 90 minutes of unlikely chases, convenient plot twists, and several subplots that we never see resolved. as adam quickly learns, what men did survive are treated as outcasts/criminals, because they are dangerous beasts that cannot help there genetic predisposition to violence. the propaganda machines have been in full swing, scaring women into believing all men are rapists and murderers. this has led to lesbianism being the norm, the fall of christianity, female only reproduction via cloning, and oh yeah world peace among other implied results. all of which seem unlikely given that only ~30 years had elapsed since the war. adam stumbles from one bad situation to the next, all the while being genetically programmed to be non-violent and unable to really do much on his own behalf. with the fbi on his trail, madams looking for fresh meat, and his creator trying to recapture him (for herself it seems), he learns that violence is not limited to the male species after all. all in all, i would not recommend this movie. i did however enjoy veronica cartwrights portrayal of the \\'love to hate her\\' director of the fbi, and julie bowen didn\\'t do bad as hope the \\'closet hetero\\' geneticist either. the first 45 minutes of dragon fighter are entirely acceptable and surprisingly watchable. the characters are believable and interesting. the cloning lab looks really high-tech. after that, it all collapses. the characters start behaving idiotically, and a new subplot is introduced from nowhere about a fusion reactor (and this is supposedly \"present day\") going critical, the only plot justification of which is that it is required to kill the dragon - only it doesn\\'t. the finish is incredibly weak. one wonders what made a movie that started out so well turn so wrong. all the characters except dean cain are played by russians. this results in some weird situations and details, like the character being played by vessela dimitrova being called \"bailey kent\" despite her heavy accent (and despite her, on one occasion, inexplicably switching to *spanish*!). because of the decent start, i considered rating this movie a 5, but it really was more disappointing than that, so i only give it 4. dr. bock teaches at the hospital and he is quite good at it. the thing about him is that he is depressed. dr. bock and his wife separated, his children are deviant, he cannot perform in the bedroom and he feels as if he isn\\'t doing a very good job at healing people. he becomes suicidal but meets barbara who changes his ideas for the better. all around this story is a murder mystery and a group of angry protesters outside. the movie is well done and the character of dr. bock is well played out. it\\'s a little sad, somewhat funny and somewhat of a drama. it was good to see a couple stories wrapped around the hospital even if they were somewhat unrelated to what dr. bock was doing. great movie. i\\'ve been playing this movie incessantly this month, and i just love it. i was around in the 60s (oh dear), so it is nostalgic in one sense. however, it\\'s the funny premise, the snappy dialogue and the great performances that keep me watching. dr. winston\\'s reactions to stephanie at the end of the movie are priceless. (i\\'d be more specific, but don\\'t want to spoil it for anyone.) who other than matthau can play a man not entirely on the up-and-up and yet have us still love him? as for bergman\\'s costumes, i think she looks as dowdy as she\\'s supposed to. i think \"she was robbed\" the one time that she appears in an evening gown. it doesn\\'t suit her at all, which is too bad. i never liked it when i first saw it on her and i still don\\'t. goldie won an oscar for her role. people thought it was a groundbreaking performance at the time, and yet it\\'s the one performance that i don\\'t love as much as the others. she does have the right amount of sweetness and likability, however, which is important for this role. and i agree - i thought rick lenz was great in it and it\\'s too bad that his movie career didn\\'t take off after this. i hope more people watch this movie ... they\\'ll love it! wow!! talk about a film that divides the audience! this is a real love it or loath it kinda movie. personally i really enjoyed it. i noticed that other reviews are comparing it to pitch black - this is kinda dumb as the only thing they have in common is sand! people can be real stupid. no, this film is far more in common with the thing (how people fail to notice is amazing - they even have the same basic music) lots of carpenter touches are there, blue collar heroes, sharp humor, endless rolling landscapes full of death and things not understood. perhaps what stops this film being a real classic is it\\'s deference to other carpenter works. not least dark star which it has something in common with. i\\'d be interested to know how much it really cost? $8000? is that even possible? maybe it was based on a short film that cost $8000? but i did find myself strangely moved when the various space dudes died. they are so underplayed that it\\'s like watching a documentary at times. having said that the script is kinda clunky and only about half of them can act however and i\\'m not sure the big guy playing the captain is one of them. but his gun is awesome!! give it a chance, if you like early carpenter you might fall for it, just don\\'t expect 2001. this movie tries to run away to the typical \\'i\\'m fighting because i\\'m obliged to defend the fatherland. the nazi\\'s are all bad guys, i\\'m against them\\' (typical of german war movies). how? by not talking too much about it, and just referring the war and the pow\\'s. nevertheless i would like to see a german movie which would be something between the extremity of come and see and the \"bad nazi\\'s\" das boot. i say this because, excluding this factor, the german movies are the best depicting 2nd world war and the german side. you easily see some of the german hierarchical relations, very different from the ones in us army. this is a movie which tries to get a real sight of what was stalingrad, and i was not there, and i doubt most people were there now, but if i would choose one movie depicting this battle, for sure would not be the all american enemy at the gates. why do i say this? because even the best soldiers are not hero\\'s, and given the conditions they may regard their own lives instead of the fatherland. this goes for all the ranks, and in the end you see von paulus giving the example. homelessness (or houselessness as george carlin stated) has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school, work, or vote for the matter. most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism, the war on iraq, pressuring kids to succeed, technology, the elections, inflation, or worrying if they\\'ll be next to end up on the streets. but what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home, the entertainment sets, a bathroom, pictures on the wall, a computer, and everything you once treasure to see what it\\'s like to be homeless? that is goddard bolt\\'s lesson. mel brooks (who directs) who stars as bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival (jeffery tambor) to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries; if bolt succeeds, he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings. the bet\\'s on where bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he can\\'t step off the sidewalk. he\\'s given the nickname pepto by a vagrant after it\\'s written on his forehead where bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of molly (lesley ann warren) an ex-dancer who got divorce before losing her home, and her pals sailor (howard morris) and fumes (teddy wilson) who are already used to the streets. they\\'re survivors. bolt isn\\'t. he\\'s not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it\\'s fight or flight, kill or be killed. while the love connection between molly and bolt wasn\\'t necessary to plot, i found \"life stinks\" to be one of mel brooks\\' observant films where prior to being a comedy, it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing saddles, young frankenstein, or spaceballs for the matter, to show what it\\'s like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don\\'t know what to do with their money. maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopoly money. or maybe this film will inspire you to help others. i a huge fan of when it comes to doctor who series and still am, but i was very disappointed when i began to watch this new series. children under the age of 15, or even better under the age of 10 will probably will enjoy it the best, and possibly new fans who haven\\'t seen any of the original series, but as far as fans of the original series, will find this series missing much of the charm the made the original series so great, it took david tennant to get me to appreciate how much better christoper eccellestion was as a doctor in the 1st season. i would only recommend this series for people who haven\\'t seen much of the original series, people who are under 15, and extremely die hard who fans, everyone else will just get a laugh and mumble curse words about russel t. davies screwed up one of our favorite tv shows. i went into this film expecting/hoping for a sleazy drive-in style slice of seventies exploitation, but what i got was more of a bizarre pseudo western with far too much talking and not enough action. it\\'s clear that this film was made on a budget; the locations are drab and poorly shot, while the acting leaves a lot to be desired also. the plot focuses on a trio of robbers (a father and two sons) that steal a load of gold after killing some miners. they come across a cabin inhabited by a young girl and her stepmother...and all this is told in flashbacks by the young girl, currently residing in an asylum. it\\'s clear that directors louis leahman and william sachs thought they were making something really shocking; but despite its best efforts, south of hell mountain is just too boring to shock the viewer. the film drones on for about eighty minutes and most of it consists of boring characters spouting off boring and long-winded dialogue. the only good thing i have to say about the film is with regards to the music; which is good in places. the ending is the only other good thing about the movie; and that\\'s only because it\\'s the last thing that happens. i wouldn\\'t recommend anyone bothers tracking this down...there was much better trash made in the seventies. looked forward to viewing this film and seeing these great actors perform. however, i was sadly disappointed in the script and the entire plot of the story. david duchovny,(dr. eugene sands),\"connie & carla\",\\'04, was the doctor in the story who uses drugs and losses his license to practice medicine. dr. sands was visiting a night club and was able to use his medical experience to help a wounded customer and was assisted by angelina jolie,(claire),\"taking lives\",\\'04, who immediately becomes attracted to dr. david sands. timothy hutton,(raymond blossom),\"kinsey\",\\'04, plays the big shot gangster and a man with all kinds of money and connections. timothy hutton seems to over act in most of the scenes and goes completely out of his mind trying to keep his gang members from being killed. gary dourdan,(yates),\"csi-vegas tv series\", plays a great supporting role and portrays a real cool dude who is a so-called body guard for raymond blossom. angelina jolie looks beautiful and sexy with her ruby red lips which draws a great deal of attention from all the men. this film is not the greatest, but it does entertain. this was one of the worst films i can remember seeing. i am sure i have seen worse, though, if that mitigates me slamming it. the humor isn\\'t funny, there are stupid stereotype jokes that, again, aren\\'t funny. i was a captive audience on a plane and viewed this film. it was a complete waste of time. i enjoyed martin in earlier films, but not this one. same for queen latifah, she was excellent in chicago and in set it off she was good too, but this role was horrid. i mostly credit the failure to the bad writing of the script. i feel strongly you can\\'t save a formulaic, unfunny script with decent actors, this movie as a case in point. still, all involved should have been wise enough to not participate in this film. i am just amazed that something so bad can get greenlighted, made, released theatrically, and promoted. i bought the dvd a long time ago and finally got around to watching it.i really enjoyed watching this film as you don\\'t get the chance to see many of the more serious better quality bollywood films like this. very well done and but i would say you need to pay attention to what is going on as it is easy to get lost. when you start watching the movie, don\\'t do anything else! i would actually advise people to read all the reviews here...including the ones with spoilers, before watching the movie. raima sen gave her first great performance that i have seen. aishwarya was easily at her best. all performances were strong, directing and cinematography...go watch it! first of all let us discuss about the story. it is a copy of the movie \"hitch\" with an added indian flavor to it. one guy, who is a love guru, and another man who is seemingly a sucker when it comes to ladies, and how this seemingly sucker becomes a charmer with the help of the love guru forms the story. salman khan is the love guru, and govinda is the lame guy. now coming to artists\\' performance, salman khan overacts throughout the movie, he tries to be funny, but fails big time. you can see salman shouting throughout the movie, no real acting is seen in his performance. govinda pairs opposite katrina kaif(oh, my god, she is one heck of a girl. a real beauty)is in real life a 50 year old dude, and katrina is a girl in her early twenties. in the movie govinda looks like grandpa of katrina kaif. what a pity! coming to execution of the movie. this movie feels like a b-movie, and a poor imitation of the movie hitch. where hitch looks like a movie with a purpose and depth, this movie is shallow and purposeless, nowhere there is justification or clarity. just forget this movie, for it is nothing but boring, typical bollywood fare. actually i give 3/10 because this is the lowest i go. i try to catch this film each time it\\'s shown on tv, which happily is quite often. but i keep forgetting to video it. as it is, i practically know the script by heart, but that doesn\\'t stop me having a good cry, in fact it probably adds to it as i cry knowing what\\'s coming next. it\\'s such a lovely film - well made, well cast, good photography. i love it. one of my top ten films. i got to know ã†on back in the early 90s via television and i loved it... what did you like about it ? the cranky drawing style ? the flawless artistic action involved ? the absurd and deadpan communication between the characters ? the whole layout of the surrounding future world ? no matter what you loved about it... the aeon flux film of late 2005 has nothing of that. karyn kusama, the so called \"director\" of the film, was hopelessly over-strained with transporting the original content to a new film. if you \\'re not familiar with the original series, you won\\'t understand anything during for the first 60minutes of the film.the story is inscrutable and the vapid characters do not develop during the film. kusama\\'s attempt to improve the storyline by implementing some rather weak explanatory conversations between the main characters is not only a lame attempt to cover up her flaws as a storyteller , it\\'s simply unworthy of the original ã†on concept. charlize theron might be an attractive woman, but she can\\'t impersonate the ã†on character. although she was attached to strings doing action scenes, her lack of talent for physical motion simply ruins the action sequences in the film. the result is a tremendous amount of hectic picture cuts to cover up the sheer lameness of her physique. forget about all the rest, it\\'s not worth talking about... i give 1point for ms.theron showing her boobs and 1point for the nice architectural photography in the film. that\\'s it. i didn\\'t expect much when i rented this movie and it blew me away. if you like good drama, good character development that draws you into a character and makes you care about them, you\\'ll love this movie. engrossing! this is like something i have never seen before. it had me cracking up the whole time i don\\'t think there was one scene that i didn\\'t laugh through. it is about a girl from the country in south who goes off to a big town for college. at the school she befriends the ra across the hall. when she realizes that he has no family to go to for thanksgiving she invites him to come home with her. rabecca and her family and her serious boyfriend all go out to dinner one night and becca realizes what her boyfriend is about to do...propose. she urges cral to do something so he stands up and shouts something like... sorry mate but you are too late i already asked becca to marry me a couple of weeks ago back at the school and she said yes. that all turns into chaos. please watch this classic it is totally worth it... i swear. this off-beat horror movie seems to be getting nothing but bad reviews. my question is; why? i think this movie is pretty good. dee snider did very well for his first (and only) time directing. he also plays the antagonist, captain howdy (carelton hendriks). this movie seems to have a view of the future. although it came out back in 1998, it seems to be about modern issues. internet predators seems to be the underlying plot here. although taken to another level, this is an issue which we still face today. i\\'ll admit, the story fell short a few times, but that doesn\\'t make this a bad movie at all. robert englund is even in this movie, that automatically makes it better. the acting wasn\\'t bad, the characters were pretty good as well. hendriks was a pretty good antagonist i think. i give this off-beat horror a 7/10. recommend for fans of saw. armored the best part about driving an armored vehicle is that if any bums approach you at a red light asking for money, you can shoot them in the face. and while the armoured guards in this thriller aren\\'t using their protective power to purge the drifter population, they are using their position to fleece their employer. when newcomer ty (columbus short) lands a job with an armored trunk company, he feels like he has found his lot in life. unfortunately, however, when he discovers that his co- workers (matt dillon, jean reno and laurence fishburne) are plotting to take the $42 m shipment for themselves, ty must fortify himself â– and the funds â– inside the armored truck. a tedious caper with a plodding plot and phoned-in performances, armored is an utterly forgettable film. besides, if you really want to jack millions, it\\'s a lot simpler to just disguise yourself as an atm. (red light) if this film becomes a holiday tradition i am going to have to hide for christmas for the rest of my life. how do you even think of comparing this with \\'a wonderful life\\'! it was absolutely awful! the boy singing made my toes curl. and what on earth was the deal with his hair?? emmy worthy performance?! please. granted, lucci did ok but an emmy????? i think this film is a waste of money. the fact that they stuck so close to the original story pretending to give it a modern and retro touch made it even worse. it lacked enthusiasm and persistence on all accounts. lighting, wardrobe, make-up, it seemed everybody wanted to go home. just a big no from me. this movie is supposed to be taking place in and around seattle. the, why is porteau cove p-r-o-v-i-n-c-i-a-l park shown? provincial parks are in canada, and not the united states. the inspector uses a palm pilot complete with stylus to \\'read\\' that someone has hacked into the computer of the bridal shop. i did not know that this was possible using a database storage device. a woman appears in the movie without any introduction and is never introduced. we learn half-way into the movie that this woman works in the district attorney\\'s office. then, in the correctional center a guard actually precedes jenks through a door and keeps his back to the offender!! this would never happen in a real correctional setting. the director really messed on this one -- this doesn\\'t happen in real life. the acting is adequate. the plot is good. the cinematography is good. however, the many errors found in the continuity lead to a 3 out of 10 vote. the movie was good. really the only reason i watched it was alan rickman. which he didn\\'t pull off the southern accent,but he did pretty well with it.know emma thompson did really good she definitely pulled off the southern accent. i like all the character in my opinion not one of them did bad,another thing i have notice. i have read all these comment and not one person has comment on alan 5 0\\'clock shadow. which made him look even better and he pretty much had one through the whole movie. i would give the movie a 9 out of 10. another one of my opinions is the movie would been better if there wasn\\'t any sex. still it was alright. love the scene were he says \"aw sh*t\" when he is setting in his car and see them in his mirror. i bought this adaptation because i really liked anne brontã«\\'s novel when i read it some time ago and usually particularly enjoy bbc dramas. but i\\'m very disappointed, i never thought it would be as bad as that: the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me as the novel had. first of all, the music (and songs) seems totally out of place in a period drama (sounds as if it\\'s been written for a contemporary horror film)and like another commentator, i was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras spun and spun round the actors. i\\'ve seen some scenes filmed that way in \"north and south\" and it seemed all right there but in the tenant, it\\'s definitely overdone and simply annoying. camera movements cannot make wooden acting lively. most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity. none of the characters were properly introduced at first. the little boy gave a very good performance, he\\'s very cute and the best feature of the film. spoilers tara fitzgerald\\'s characterisation of helen graham made her appear cold and harsh, letting no emotion pass through. she doesn\\'t seem to be able to cry at all in a realistic way. i just couldn\\'t believe markham could have fell for her and i\\'m not mentioning the awful hairdo she was given. i could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband! fancy being married to such a virago... besides, he was the only main actor that sounded right to me. toby stephens i found just ok, helen graham\\'s brother not very good. maybe it\\'s difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such bleak subjects as alcoholism and cruelty. besides, what is only hinted at and left to the reader\\'s imagination in the book is dwelt upon with complaisance in the tv adaptation: making some scenes both gross and comic, (like when huntingdon\\'s eye starts bleeding) and others far too sexed up for a period drama! i mean, don\\'t we get enough of those bed scenes in contemporary dramas? the gate to hell has opened up under moscow. a priest, played by vincent gallo, goes to the city to find a friend who has gone missing in the tunnels under the city in an attempt to find the gateway. wandering around underground he and his colleagues have to deal with the tunnels inhabitants both human and demonic. good idea with a good cast of second tier actors goes nowhere much like the tunnels that are its setting. i\\'ve watched this twice now and i still have no idea why this is suppose to be scary when not a heck of a lot happens other then people talk about the evil and we see shadow forms. nothing is clear and honestly i didn\\'t see the point of it all other than provide a pay check for those involved (second billed val kilmer is in a couple of fleeting scenes that don\\'t amount to much other than to allow him to be billed as in the film.) the idea is really good, the performances are fine, the script goes nowhere. take the advice of several of the characters in the film and don\\'t cross the river to see this. walter matthau and george burns just work so well together. the acidity of willy with the perplexed amnesic al is a mixture made in heaven. the scene when they meet again in willy\\'s flat is a gem and the final scene rounds up the film to perfection. walter matthau gives a superb performance as the irascible semi-retired comedian as only he can, the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated dramatics coupled with his general misunderstanding of what is going on form a great characterization. george burns timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this film, his calm aplomb with desert dry replies are memorable. watch for the scene near the end when al and his daughter ask something of the spanish caretaker, and al\\'s reaction - priceless. warning spoiler. . . i have to agree with you, it was almost there. this was such a bad movie, about such and interesting true story. it had such promise, but the acting was ridiculous at best. some sets were beautiful and realistic. others are something out of a theme park. i found myself laughing as i watched, what was suppose to be, serious scenes. i really wanted to like this movie, but i couldn\\'t. the best part was the fight between friends that ended with the \"king\" dying. i liked the queens\\' punishment. and, the final shot made a beautiful picture, though. there are so many better movies to watch. i don\\'t recommend this. brown of harvard is a hard movie to pin down. we expect a lot more from our movies these days, so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20\\'s were a bit more innocent. william haines is charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and, even, glory. all of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted except for the homoerotic tie between billy and jack pickford, the town nerd. the movie has everything, romance, tears, love, death, and even sports... it\\'s a great education in how society has changed in the 20th century. i was skimming over the list of films of richard burton when i came to this title that i recall vividly from when i first saw it on cable in 1982. i remember dialogue from tatum o\\'neal that was just amazingly bad. i remember richard burton\\'s character looking so hopelessly lost, and then remembering how his motivations didn\\'t translate to me. in short, i remember \"circle of two\" because it was so phenomenally awful. this movie came out at a time when america was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality. recall \"the blue lagoon\" (and other brooke shields annoyances), \"lipstick\", \"little darlings\", \"beau pere\" and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex, particularly with adults. as a teenager during this time, i found the obsession, combined with the sexual excesses of the 70\\'s and 80\\'s, made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all out, so to speak. \"circle of two\" is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient, like \"blue lagoon\". in fact, it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave, if totally failed, way. but honestly, it is one of those films you will *never* see if you didn\\'t see it on its first run because it was so truly awful. no one would want to have this garbage ever surface to be publicly distributed again. i remember watching american gothic when it first aired, it came into my mind recently, all i could remember was the same guy appeared in midnight caller, which is gary cole, i don\\'t watch much tv, but i watched american gothic, i purchased the complete series on dvd this week,& it\\'s still as good as ever, this is one of the best tv series ever, the reason i don\\'t watch much tv is because it\\'s just rubbish that\\'s on, except for derren brown, it\\'s all reality tv or soaps, such as grease, big brother etc, i\\'m fed up with it, i got the complete series of american gothic for â£16.97 form the asda website, that\\'s the cheapest i can find it. . . . and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice, bouncy jugs running around the so called african jungle. so no problems there for most males out there. i watched it as one of those bundled together package. forget about the plot which is essentially just a flimsy storyline to get our heroine flashing her jugs on screen at every opportunity possible. just to give you a sense, our heroine swings from vine to vine and climb on top animals at every chance possible for no good reason at all just to let you see her jugs at all angles. again, no complaints. the \"fight scenes\" are laughable and borderline on the pornographic. our heroine got caught by the baddies at least five times in the movie. on occasions when she has to fight, the \"fighting\" involves rolling around in the dirt, grunting unconvincingly and basically fighting like kittens. i am surprised no hair pulling is involved. it get so bad that the chief baddie had to remind the \"combatants\" that \"i said, the one that draw first blood wins!\" in order to avoid watching anymore stupid fighting. the witch doctor kuku was a bloody blast. from being a big, cuddly bear in the beginning, he became manic depressive when captured and then, outright psycho. he spent the whole movie muttering lines with no irrelevance. beside liana (our heroine)bouncing around topless, you also get to see plenty of other amazonians as well as one woman who decided to jump naked into the lake to take a swim for no good reasons. yeah, it is that kind of movie. watch the beautiful liane in her bouncy glory. despite the movie being more than 20 years old, the allure of watching blond women flashing their nice jugs on screen never gets old. \"coconut fred\\'s fruit salad island!\" is a hilarious show that is on saturday mornings on wb. it stars coconut fred and all of his friends on the island, and every episode is a very funny misadventure of theirs. most of the time, it is because of coconut fred\\'s trouble making antics which makes it funny, and other stuff going on on the island at the same time. the humor is great and nobody on the island is very bright at all, which adds it being as amusing as it is. i don\\'t think this could be funnier. the voice talents of the characters are magnificently superior and are exaggerated, which adds to the show\\'s hilarity. if this is ever on dvd, i\\'m getting it a.s.a.p! strongly recommended for a good laugh. the poet carne disappears (didnâ´t he disappeared with prã©vert?) and is followed by the judge carne. the director wants to give his own vision of a youth that he doesnâ´t understand and he doesnâ´t want to. itâ´s a long way from the wonderful \"les enfants du paradis\"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this movie, which i just discovered at the video store, has apparently sit around for a couple of years without a distributor. it\\'s easy to see why. the story of two friends living in new york searching for their pal from high school who is now living homeless under the boardwalk at coney island, has flashes of being a very good film, but ultimately is weighted down by the story focusing on stan and daniel, rather than on their homeless friend richie. cryer is as usual very good and the film has a nice stark look to it, with the ghostly images of coney island. however, writer cryer and director richard schenkman are too busy dealing with the fairly uninteresting lives of stan and daniel rather than focusing on richie. one flashback in a music store, where richie has a crush on an employee stands out and really shows the viewer where this film could have gone. but in the end, not much. two many drawn out scenes of annoyance, such as inside the skeeball building. rating 4 out of 10. how viewers react to this new \"adaption\" of shirley jackson\\'s book, which was promoted as not being a remake of the original 1963 movie (true enough), will be based, i suspect, on the following: those who were big fans of either the book or original movie are not going to think much of this one...and those who have never been exposed to either, and who are big fans of hollywood\\'s current trend towards \"special effects\" being the first and last word in how \"good\" a film is, are going to love it. things i did not like about this adaption: 1. it was not a true adaption of the book. from the articles i had read, this movie was supposed to cover other aspects in the book that the first one never got around to. and, that seemed reasonable, no film can cover a book word for word unless it is the length of the stand! (and not even then) but, there were things in this movie that were never by any means ever mentioned or even hinted at, in the movie. reminded me of the way they decided to kill off the black man in the original movie version of the shining. i didn\\'t like that, either. what the movie\\'s press release should have said is...\"we got the basic, very basic, idea from shirley jackson\\'s book, we kept the same names of the house and several (though not all) of the leading character\\'s names, but then we decided to write our own story, and, what the heck, we watched the changeling and the shining and ghost first, and decided to throw in a bit of them, too.\" 2. they completely lost the theme of a parapyschologist inviting carefully picked guest who had all had brushes with the paranormal in their pasts, to investigate a house that truly seemed to have been \"born bad\". no, instead, this \"doctor\" got everyone to the house under the false pretense of studying their \"insomnia\" (he really invited them there to scare them to death and then see how they reacted to their fear...like lab rats, who he mentioned never got told they are part of an experiment...nice guy). this doctor, who did not have the same name, by the way, was as different from the dedicated professional of the original movie as night from day. 3. in direct contrast to the statement that was used to promote both movies \"some houses are just born bad\", this house was not born bad but rather became bad because of what happened there...and, this time around, nel gets to unravel the mystery (shades of the changeling). the only problem was, the so-called mystery was so incoherently told that i\\'m sure it remained a mystery to most of the audience...but, then there was no mystery in the first place (not in the book), because the house was bad to begin with. it\\'s first \"victim\" died before ever setting eyes on it. 4. the way the character of luke was portrayed was absolutely ridiculous. he was supposed to be a debonair playboy who was someday to inherit the house (and was a true skeptic of it\\'s \"history\")...and in this one he was just a winey-voiced, bumbling nerd who couldn\\'t sleep(insomnia remember) and was a compulsive liar. 5. i was also annoyed with the way the movie jumped from almost trying to recreate original scenes word for word (the scene with nel\\'s sister\\'s family, and mrs. dudley\\'s little opening speech...) to going off into flights of fancy that made me think more of these other movies than the haunting. it\\'s like it couldn\\'t make up its mind what it wanted to do. 6. i missed nel\\'s narrative through the whole movie. the original was so like a gothic novel in the way that the story was mostly told in the first person, through nel\\'s eyes, and we always were privy to her thoughts. that totally unique touch was completely lost in the new version. they also tried to make nel much more of a heroine. the original nel was not a bad person, but she was a bitter person (could she be otherwise after sacrificing 11 years of her life to a selfish old woman and a spiteful sister?) and she liked to moan, and she lost her temper... this one was almost too good to be true. this was never more apparent than in the climax of the movie where the writer\\'s had obviously been watching ghost one too many times. 7. they changed the history of the house and it\\'s occupents too much. there was no abigail crain (the daughter of hugh whose legend loomed large in the original versions), there was no \"companion\", and there was no nursery. there was also no \"grace\" (wife of the original doctor) and hugh crain\\'s wives died in totally different ways. these changes, changed the story way too much. i don\\'t know whether the producers of this movie should be glad shirley jackson no longer walks this earth or whether they should...be sorry (if ya get my drift!!! the hauntings she could envision are not something to be trifled with!!!). in conclusion, let me just leave you with some words from the original luke (appropriate substitution of the word \"house\" for \"movie\"!): \"this \\'movie\\' should be burnt to the ground, and the ground sprinkled with salt!\" my favorite movie of all time remains so. no competition from this one. as a fan of wm. faulkner since college, i was especially pleased to see intruder in the dust and for other reasons. my grandfather, also named clarence brown as was the director, grew up in the oxford area having been born near there in 1888. we attended a week long family reunion at oxford in july, 1964 a mere 15 years after filming the movie. it still looked mostly like it does in the film but was going thru a period of civil rights upheaval then as the site of ole miss. my recollection is of its being a nice little college town that summer but i was just an 18 year old college sophomore and white. i was just then beginning to see the injustice of segregation and prejudice but still had a long way to go. anyhow, the movie is well worth watching but the filmmakers must have had to walk a tight rope to get it done there and i would love to know more about that story. now days, oxford is a larger, more modern college town with all the ills that go along with such things and i hope to return again to see how it must have changed socially in the last 40 plus years. juano hernandez should certainly have been nominated for an oscar that year but hollywood was still to bigoted itself to let that happen. other faulkner stories have been filmed so look for them and compare. one of the best was a pbs treatment of the barn burner from about 1985 or so starring tommy lee jones. it really captured the intensity of rural southern whites that faulkner wrote so incisively about so often. i just caught \"farewell to the king\" on cable, and maybe it\\'s just because i\\'m a girl, but i thought this was on the craptastic side. the script and direction are pretentious (once i found out john milius was responsible, it all became clear). the supporting actors actually weren\\'t bad - james fox was outstanding. the biggest disappointment was nick nolte, who i usually enjoy. once he goes native, he starts speaking a very stiff, stilted english, and half the time, he seems kind of distracted, as if he\\'d just smoked some of the bounty of borneo\\'s rain forest. and then the end -- what the ??? learoyd just happens to be on the same boat as the botanist (by the way, had the botanist dumped the girlfriend, or what?)??? the boat just happens to run aground conveniently close to an island ripe takeover by a crazy anglo ex-headhunting army deserter?? a great suspense movie with terrific slow camera-work adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy. director-writer brian de palma does a super hitchcock-imitation (many called it a \"ripoff\") with this film and the 2.35:1 widescreen dvd is a must to fully appreciate the camera-work (and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted-for-tv tapes). the downside of the movie, at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard, is the general sleaziness of all the characters, including the policeman played by a pre-nypd dennis franz (who has hair here!). the opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of angie dickinson that is quite explicit, even 25 years after its release. the film has several erotic scenes in it as dickinson (if that is really her on the closeups) and nancy allen are not shy about showing their bodies. there is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until franz enters the picture after the murder. the first 36 minutes are riveting and even though it\\'s apparent who the killer is, it\\'s still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through, particularly for males ogling the naked women. choose your fate: the terrible tykes of the fourth form, playing practical jokes that involve axes, or the...ummm...well-developed girls of the sixth form, who discovered some time ago cigarettes, gin, sex and how easily men can be led astray. the problem is that one set comes with the other. they are all there at st. trinian\\'s, that remarkably easy-going english school for girls led by headmistress millicent fritton (alastair sim). as miss fritton is fond of pointing out, \"in other schools girls are sent out quite unprepared into a merciless world, but when our girls leave here, it is the merciless world which has to be prepared.\" miss fritton sounds something like a melding of julia child and eleanor roosevelt, and definitely has sim\\'s droll and deadpan comic genes. in the belles of st. trinian\\'s, a sly, chaotic comedy from the team of frank launder and sidney gilliat, st. trinian\\'s is, as usual, on the brink of financial disaster. salvation may be at hand, however, when a rich sheik sends his daughter to join the fourth form and receive a proper english education. the sheik also is a horse owner and one of his prize racers, arab boy, is being trained near the school for a race. it\\'s only a matter of time before the fourth- form girls form a racing pool and bet heavily on arab boy, with miss fritton adding to the pool what funds the school has left. (much of the fourth-form girl\\'s money comes from the gin they make in chemistry, then bottle and lower by rope to flash harry (george cole), a cockney fixer, for distribution. \"it\\'s got something...i don\\'t know quite what,\" says miss fritton on sampling the stuff, \"but send a few bottles up to my room.\") miss fritton, however, has a brother, clarence fritton (who, by some coincidence of casting, also is alastair sim), a bookmaker who not only has placed a bundle on another horse, but who also has a daughter. and he has placed the precocious arabella in the sixth form to keep him informed. soon the sixth form has kidnapped arab boy, the fourth form has taken the horse back, flash harry has joined forces with miss fritton, the sixth-form girls are determined that arab boy will not leave the second floor of st. trinian\\'s, clarence and his homburg-wearing gang have arrived, parents are driving up for parent\\'s day and the ministry of education has arrived in the person of a very proper inspector. total war breaks out at st. trinian\\'s. it\\'s hard to say which is more dangerous, the african spears or the flour bombs. alastair sim as millicent fritton turns in a tour de force performance. miss fritton is a tall woman with a stately bosom, fond of long gowns with embroidered lace and edwardian hats with lots of feathers. she takes everything in stride, even a fourth-former pounding at something in chemistry class and, after hearing an explosion a few minutes later, the results. \"oh dear. i told bessie to be careful with that nitro-glycerine!\" she is firm in believing that st. trinian\\'s is \"a gay arcadia of happy girls.\" sim was one of britain\\'s great eccentric actors. other than the sheer chaos of all the little (and not so little) girls doing terrible things, he delivers much of the film\\'s pleasure. this movie was absolutely wonderful. the pre-partition time and culture has been recreated beautifully. urmila has given yet another brilliant performance. what i truly admire about this movie is that it doesn\\'t resort to pakistan-bashing that is running rampant in movies like gadar and loc. with the partition as a backdrop, the movie does not divert to political issues or focus on violence or what is right and wrong. the movie always centers around the tragic story of urmila\\'s life. her fragile relationship with manoj bajpai has been depicted excellently. the movie actually shows how the people, both hindus and muslims, have suffered from this partition. the theme that there is only one religion is truly prevalent in this film. a terrible amateur movie director (no, not todd sheets), his new friend and sister explore a cave. the friend and sister fall in and get rescued. meanwhile a gang of horribly acted girls are defending their \\'turf\\'. whatever the heck that means. this film and i use the term very loosely is so bad that it\\'s.. well bad. the humor is painfully unfunny, the \"action\" merely sad. now i\\'ve seen some atrociously awful \\'horror\\' films in my time & failed to grow jaded in my approach to watching low-budget films, yet i still weep openly for anyone who choose to sit through this. only for the most hardened maschocists amongst you. but the rest run away fast!! my grade: f this movie could have been a lot better than it was, if hadn\\'t been a disney film. i thought that the young girl playing shirley was all right, you could tell that she was really trying to do the job right. the teenage shirley temple wasn\\'t right at all. i think that they should have spent last time on her childhood, the first hour should have been about the young shirley, then the last hour should have been about the older shirley. this was a boring movie, and not a good shirley temple story. i\\'m surprised that no one yet has mentioned that there are two versions of this same film. the lion\\'s share of the footage in both is identical, but here is where they differ: in one version (the version i have seen most often on broadcast tv), the group of clerics guarding the gateway consists of the \"brotherhood of the protectors\", a (fictional) splinter group of priests and brothers \"excommunicated\" by the church. in the other version, which i\\'ve seen only once on tv, the clerics guarding the gateway are depicted as priests of the official church, meaning the archdiocese of new york (or perhaps brooklyn). also, in the former version, in most of the pertinent scenes, the clerics are referred to as \"brothers\" (and in some scenes, you can see where the lips say \"father\" so-and-so but the dubbed audio says \"brother\" so-and-so. in the latter version, i believe everyone is referred to as \"father\". in any event, it seems that one of these two versions is more or less a partial re-shooting of the other, with all \"brotherhood of the protector\" scenes re-shot as \"archdiocese\" scenes, or vice versa. (kind of reminds me of the raymond burr cutaway scenes in \"godzilla\"). i have videotaped both versions off broadcast tv, so no, i\\'m not imagining this. can anyone shed some more light on the story behind these two versions of the film? there is a dvd published in the uk in 2002 code hrgd002 on the cover, no asin, vfc 19796 on the disk, no ifpi code in the inner rim. probably a straight transfer from vhs. there is no much point is commenting an adult film. but this one contains a minimal plot, and the characters are believable. it was shown in the united states in normal cinemas. i\\'ve seen it in pensylvannia way back in 1975. as such it deserves a place in an encyclopedia of movies. the dvd has no special features and no subtitles, and was probably made using a vhs tape as source don\\'t watch this film while, or soon after, eating. having said that, begotten will stick with you for the rest of your life, like it or not. based on the nihilistic philosophy that life is nothing more than man spasming above ground (to paraphrase the title sequence/introduction), this will more than likely contain the most intense and grisly imagery you\\'ll ever see in a film. there is no dialogue, only image after image describing the cycle of life. the film\\'s combination of stark black and white photography compounded with some truly creepy background sounds work to drive home the maker\\'s message. the movie begins with god (portrayed as a bandaged and obviously insane man) slicing open his torso with a straight razor and subsequently dying in his own filth. after his death, mother nature emerges from his corpse to impregnate herself with his blood and semen and gives birth to man, represented by a maggot of a human convulsing on the earth. the landscape is a barren waste, populated by hulking shrouded humanoids who eventually happen upon mother nature and man. after a slew of violent scenes depicting the rape of nature and destruction of man, these humanoids proceed to pound the remains of the corpses back into the ground, and the cycle of life begins anew. i actually rented this from blockbuster one night, based on the cover art and hype content, but this is definitely not a blockbuster-type film. don\\'t expect narrative, dialogue or any pulled punches. this is intense imagery based on a dark subject. i give this movie some high marks for the filmwork and audio, but i don\\'t think i\\'ll be watching it too often, if again. i like my movies dark and unique, but this one is exponentially more than i expected. this cheapo exploitation flick is some genuinely insipid stuff, courtesy of spaghetti land director lamberto bava, who wisely left his name off this junk. the basic crux of this outing concerns the discovery of some brutally mutilated individuals being washed-up on shore in the caribbean. authorities initially believe them to be victims of shark attacks, but as the investigation unravels, turns out to be something much more sinister. all of this ultimately amounts to very little however, we have here - poor dubbing complimented by similarly weak script, which often consists of nonsensical jabbering, and is really of little consequence for the most part. acting can only be described as sub-par, which is par for the course in this instance. truly lax direction doesn\\'t help things either. special effect mainly is for numerous close-ups of various gory bodies missing limbs, and so forth. of course, there is the obligatory creature which periodically emerges at feeding time, which looks something like a big monster octopus thing, where its animation only consists of its pointed teeth ascending and descending in rhythmic articulation. overall, the end result is none too convincing, sure, but admittedly is almost entertaining in a cheesy kind of fashion. it seems what the film makers were going for was a sort of low-rent hybrid of jaws and piranha, but the final product is just a bloody shambles, much like the corpses incessantly shown throughout this picture. i find it difficult to think of any redeeming attributes to warrant viewing this, so moreover, strictly for incurable monster movie addicts. walt disney\\'s 20th animated feature was the last one to be greenlighted by the great man himself (he died in late 1966) and is not generally considered to be among their very best output. the main problem is that, on the surface, the film seems merely to be the feline version of either lady and the tramp (1955) or 101 dalmations (1961) both of which are certainly more beloved by fans even so, being both an animation and cat lover, i dug this reasonably bouncy concoction in which a pampered female cat (voiced by eva gabor) and her three little kittens are thrown out onto the streets of paris by a wealthy lady (hermione baddeley)\\'s greedy butler. luckily, they meet a streetwise alley cat (phil harris) who guides them on the journey back and are further aided along the way by a feline jazz band (led by scatman crothers) and two helpful and amiably dopey dogs; meanwhile at home, edgar the butler celebrates his supposed inheritance and the mouse and the horse do their bit to help their fellow feline pets. legendary entertainer maurice chevalier was whisked back from retirement to sing the title song (which includes a verse in french) and scatman\\'s band indulge in a breezy number \"ev\\'rybody wants to be a cat\". i first saw this movie at a video store and, being the bam margera fan i am, had to rent it to see what it was all about. since i have a huge and stupid (note the word stupid) sense of humor, i found this movie absolutely hilarious. some of the parts are pointless and random, but that\\'s what makes them so amusing. you\\'ll need to think things like getting slapped in the face and bashed on the head with a watermelon are funny in order to appreciate this movie. i was really impressed. i was also surprised at the acting. these people actually did a good job. nothing oscar worthy, but well enough to get past the amateur level. teens and young adults would probably find this more entertaining because of the modern slang and situations used. i wouldn\\'t suggest watching this with your parents and vice versa. all in all, the acting was great, the script was hilarious, and the story is really something you can relate to. i loved it, it was really gruesome and disgusting. i thought that the tearing of the human flesh was thoroughly provacative. the way that it was depicting the human crucifix about jesus christ was really interesting. the tearing about limbs and jaws was awesome brutally gruesome. don\\'t watch this if you have a weak heart, you wouldn\\'t be able to stand it. citizen kane....the godfather part ii....d\\'urville martin\\'s dolemite. this is the single greatest piece of celluloid ever created and unleashed upon humanity. rudy ray moore, in a role that transcends academy awards stars as dolemite, the baddest cat in the universe. he clearly does not take any jive from no turkey (i myself am unfortunately a turkey) and proves it with his powers of rapping, pimping, and karate chopping. this is blaxploitation at its absolute finest, a shining example of the genre with its low budget, continuity errors, and hatred for rat-soup eating honkey expletive expletive. the true godfather of rap (not this new ali nonsense) moore is something of a juxtaposition of acting technique; somehow managing to be the most charismatic awful actor of the 1970\\'s, and thats saying something. this one is highly recommended folks, if not for the one-liners alone. ok. on the whole, this three part documentary will bring most interested people up to date with going\\'s on in the world of physics, and the last 300 years of discovery of our universe. if you have read stephen hawkings brilliant book \"a brief history of time\" and understood it then you might benefit from the visual description of certain concepts..which i did to a certain extent. greene is bearable, but obviously for the sake of the masses, tends to explain things in a slighty patronising way. this is of course deliberate and will be perfect for almost everyone who watches this series. the guest scientists were good. (no hawking, but i suppose he has his own dvd(s) ) i kept waiting for him to appear but they rotate through the same ones for almost 3 parts... (very american weighted here, with a few brits and one antipodean) i bought the nova 2 disc edition (ntsc) and there were a few inclusions that really detracted from the overall experience. 1. the \"this is brought to you by..\" at the start of each part was a necessary evil for the first part, but seeing it 2 more times before it was over was very ordinary. 2. can\\'t be helped i suppose but there is quite a bit of overlap at the start of 2 and 3 which had me reaching for the ffw button a few times. 3. this disc set was straight from tv..(ie ads, what happen last show for those that missed it, and frequent \"goto pbs.org for more ....\" )appearing throughout the presentation. (quite unlike bbc material which is unmatched for presentation..planets, the blue planet, etc) my 7/10 is based on content alone. the niggles were there but i got over them. if this had have been done with that classic british accented presenter( you know the one) it would be a perfect disc set in my opinion. if you have seen this and want more...then i highly recommend hawkings book \" a brief history of time\"... i wish it was a movie too. happy viewing. another woo\\'s masterpiece! this is a best wuxie film i\\'m ever seen! woo - rulez forever (except some hollywood moments...). john woo - greater director of the century. maybe hi is not more intellectual than lot of big directors... but he is lyrical and spiritual idol of all free-mind people! his movies like the great poetry! woo is a movie sheakspeare! woo is a movie biron! woo is a mozart of bloodshet!!!! imho violent in woo films is not a directors bloodlust, but a instrument of art. themes of woo movies is more humanistic that more of the new films. i love this show as it action packed with adventure, love and intrigue. well some times love! it\\'s so good see a show where all the characters work well together and they treat each other with respect. it\\'s also very good to se dick van dyke in a television role as i have only seen him in mary poppins. the mixture of the main characters, mark, amanda, jesse and steve is very capturing to the audience. this is a show you have to watch! i saw the movie before i read the michelle magorian book and i enjoyed both. the movie, more than the book, made me come close to tears on several occasions. this film touches the deepest points of the human soul and never lets go. i encourage as many people to watch this masterpiece as much and as soon as possible. i give it ten stars. some unsuspecting films carry a message that resonates in the hours and days after viewing. such is the case for carol\\'s journey (el viaje de carol), a beautifully crafted 2002 film from spain based on the novel \\'a boca de noche\\' by ã\\x81ngel garcã\\xada roldã¡n who also adapted the book as a screenplay. war and its consequences are not new subject matter for films, but when that war theme plays in the background as a subtle driving force to develop characters (especially children) who must face adult life influenced by the games of adults, the result is a different and more tender examination of the coming of age film genre. carol (clara lago) is a 12-year-old spanish american youngster from new york who with her critically ill mother aurora (marã\\xada barranco) returns to her aurora\\'s home in 1938 at the height of the spanish civil war, a home that has been left deserted by her father don amalio (ã\\x81lvaro de luna) since his wife\\'s death. carol\\'s father robert (ben temple) is a fighter pilot who has sided with the republicans against franco and is rarely with his family. aurora has a past: she left her lover alfonso (alberto jimã©nez) to marry robert, and alfonso in turn married aurora\\'s cold sister dolores (lucina gil). carol is an independent girl who remains aloof to all but her grandfather don amalio until she meets others her age but not of her \\'class\\': tomiche (juan josã© ballesta) and his two friends at first resent carol, but as events develop carol and tomiche are bonded by what feels like the first awakenings of love. when aurora dies of her illness, carol must live with alfonso and dolores and their daughter blanca (luna mcgill), yet turns to her grandfather for support and to her mother\\'s best friend and teacher maruja (the always radiant rosa maria sardã ) to understand the disparity between classes and the senseless war that keeps her beloved father from her side. through a series of incidents carol and tomiche learn the rigors of becoming adults, facing more traumas in a brief period of the war than most of us experience in a lifetime. the ending, though sad, is uplifting as carol\\'s journey to maturity is complete. the film is shot in galicia and portugal and contains some extraordinarily beautiful settings captured with gentle sensitive lighting by cinematographer gonzalo f. berridi and enhanced by the musical score by bingen mendizã¡bal. director imanol uribe understands the fine line separating pathos from bathos, and in electing to concentrate the story on the children involved, he makes an even stronger statement about the futility and cruelty of war. the cast is exceptional: the stars clearly are young clara lago and juan josã© ballesta, but they are supported by the fine veteran actors in the adult roles. this is a visually stunning work with a lasting message and should find a much larger audience than it has to this date. grady harp road to perdition can be summed up by thomas newman\\'s score . it\\'s haunting and beautiful but you\\'re aware that this music is similar to newman\\'s other work and while listening to the soundtrack you\\'re reminded of scent of a woman , meeting joe black and the shawshank redemption you\\'re reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen . as the sullivans drive round america trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of the getaway , irish gangsters is miller\\'s crossing whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by coppola and leone\\'s gangster epics. despite having a seen it all before feel this shouldn\\'t be taken as a heavy criticism of sam mendes film which i repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and i was slightly confused as the events that caused michael sullivan to be betrayed . but if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you can\\'t help thinking what a superb director mendes is road to perdition is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances . i\\'ve never been all that keen on tom hanks but he\\'s every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role , probably better . paul newman plays a character with an irish accent but at no point did i believe i was watching an american screen legend putting on a false accent - newman\\'s performance works due to the subtle body language , his character is torn up by guilt but newman never milks it or goes over the top . while never upstaging newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two brit supporting actors craig and law are also very memorable as american gangsters and while law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how daniel craig might have progressed as a character actor if he hadn\\'t decided to become james bond , a role which heralds the end of an actors career the most important thing about this movie is the brilliant performance by daniel day-lewis and hugh o\\'conor as christy brown, guineas artist and fighter who despite of her physical condition overcame all the odds. as a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy, i can assure you that their performance were shockingly convincing. the enormous support that christy got form his family, low-income, working class dubliners, encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture depicted this support brilliantly have not read the book, but the dialogs were written wisely to capture christy brown\\'s witty arrogant personality. i do recommend this movie to everyone, especially to classic movie-lovers. i buy or at least watch every seagall movie. he came out with a handful of good movies then descending into poor stories, bad camera work and a walk-thru persona, he nearly lost me. a few movies ago he remembered how to make a decent movie. now he\\'s forgotten again. this film is seriously dark (on any level you care to name). there is a lot of slash & gash going on here with no discernible purpose unless it\\'s meant as a warning against the military. seagall may have had a stand-in for many of his scenes as it was often too dark to tell and someone else\\'s voice was used most of the time. sadly the only interesting character was the bad guy who killed his guard to escape custody & then proceeded to raise havoc all over the place. okay since when do we place an armed guard in the holding room with a prisoner? anyway this bad guy was at least colorful, and very focused. there\\'s lots of gore if you like that king of thing. it looked to me like the bad guys tore the same gash every time. i\\'m just glad they didn\\'t suck the blood from their hapless victims. i harken you back to my summary. basically it is a horror movie disguised as an action film.dec 6,2006 absolutely stunning, warmth for the head and the heart. the kind of movie western movie makers are too rushed, too frenetic to even attempt. my kids watched it, and they loved it too. what real people--goes to show you how cultural differences (the japanese setting) is less important than the human similarities. go see it, whether you like dancing or not. i recently saw this film at a 3-d film festival in hollywood. it was in polarized 3-d (gray glasses not red & blue) it was so much fun to watch this film with an audience, the print was excellent and the 3-d perfect. the performances were over the top and that added to the fun, the surprise ending (that we aren\\'t supposed to share with fellow movie go\\'ers, at least according to the movie trailer and poster) had people howling with laughter. by today\\'s standards this is probably more comedy than horror but with the added dimension of 3-d (complete with cobwebs and bats coming out of the screen) this film was an entertaining romp into 50\\'s horror. michael stearns plays mike, a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality. he has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men that\\'s when he loses it. he believes that when women actually have sex that\\'s when they lose any sense of \"innocence\" and/or \"beauty\". so he strolls through the hollywood hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance, ultimately shooting the men dead with a high-powered rifle with a scope. the seeming primary reason for this movie\\'s existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again. the \"story\" comes off as more of an afterthought. this is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as we\\'re treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity (the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes) and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation. of course, seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism. (for one thing, mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger.) this is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrack. those with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another. it even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds mike and renders him uncertain *how* to react. it unfolds at a very slow pace, but wraps up with a most amusing ironic twist. it\\'s a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewers glued to the screen. 7/10 i saw this film as a kid about 30 years ago, and i haven\\'t forgotten it to this day. i couldn\\'t say whether it\\'s a good picture. but in those days i instantly fell in love with jean simmons. the memories concentrate on the very erotic feel of the movie, but i still remember the plot. simmons was very young then, and there is another film that gave me the same feeling: david lean\\'s great expectations. and again it was the young jean simmons. it\\'s a pity that blue lagoon is not available on video; i\\'d like to correct my memories... feels like an impressionistic film; if there is such a thing. the story is well told, very poetic. the characters well developed and well acted by the interpreters (or interpreted by the actors :)). the film delights in its own sumptuous emotions at times and works well, unless you hate such emotion in movies - not so in my case. it\\'s a very humanistic film. the landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the displaced cook are very poetic in their own right. well done. a good classic for any good film collection. oh, how i laughed during those first couple of scenes. this silly little film about an 11 year-old who carries a gun, steals cars, robs stores, burglars houses, extorts money from other kids, burns houses, shoots rats, buys drugs, distributes drugs to his mother and his friends, and then kills a guy. what a great comedy! but it wasn\\'t intended to be a comedy. it was intended as a social drama. how can this be? the events in this film are absurd and ridiculous. the characters are all stereotypes right out of a 4 year-old\\'s comic-strip-induced immature imagination. the dialog is laughable; people talk like morons. it\\'s a very dumb film. the first scenes are indeed very funny, for all the wrong reasons. but the unintentional hilarity of the idiotic premise runs out after a short while, and after that the laughs come only rarely; by that time the viewer can\\'t believe what he is seeing and is alternately amazed and bored by what follows (if he has at least half a brain cell). a short film, but feels like an eternity. the film actually is a seriously-intended attempt to show the world of a young degenerate, while imitating movies vastly superior to it, like \"fun\". there is just such an air of phoniness about everything; the kids, the adults, everyone lacks credibility both in their actions and dialog. the kid in the lead mugs his way through the film as though he had seen all the jimmy cagney movies at least a hundred times. and, typically enough, the kid isn\\'t portrayed as a reservoir of evil, but, instead, as a misunderstood little artistic talent. but of course. every young hooligan is misunderstood - society made him bad. poor child. the film is embarrassing; a collection of stale, occasionally hilarious clichã©s put together to make a movie that lacks intelligence and meaning. the intellectual level of the film is zero. lackawanna blues is a drama through and through. it details the life of a strong woman by the name of rachel crosby (s. epatha merkerson). rachel is referred to as nanny by all who know her, but she could have just as easily been called wonder woman. she epitomized strength, will power, confidence and resolve. she owned a home that she used to house just about every type of person that society would reject. her tenants consisted of a lesbian, a psychotic war veteran, an amputee, and a host of other vagrants that made the home miles away from ordinary. each successive event rachel took in stride and handled flawlessly. she wasn\\'t a dictator devoid of compassion, but in fact she was quite the opposite. she displayed compassion almost to a fault by giving shelter and refuge to so many that she seemed to over-extend herself. merkerson did a good job, but i believe this role was right up her alley anyway. the movie had an even keel never straying from rachel. there were of course dramatic moments but they were to be expected. nothing was ever to shocking or profound other than rachel herself. san francisco is a big city with great acting credits. in this one, the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city. they didn\\'t even manage the most basic of realistic details. so i would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a san francisco movie. you will not be thinking \"oh, i\\'ve been there,\" you will be thinking \"how did a two story firetrap/stinky armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby?\" some of the leads used east coast speech styles and affectations. it detracts, but the acting was always competent. the stories seemed to be shot in three distinct styles, at least in the beginning. the chinatown story was the most effective and interesting. the plot is weak, ripped scene for scene from classy hong kong action movies. the originals had a lot more tension and emotional resonance, they were framed and paced better. but the acting is fun and we get to see james hong and other luminaries. the white boy intro was pointless. i think the filmmakers didn\\'t know what to do with it, so they left it loosely structured and cut it down. the father is an odd attempt at a berkeley liberal - really, folks, everyone knows it\\'s not \"groovy\" to live in the ghetto - but his segments are the most humorous. they threw away some good opportunities. educated and embittered on the west coast, a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they make in new york. they are equally intolerable but always distinguishable. that would have been interesting; this was not. the hunter\\'s point intro was the most disappointing. it was the most derivative of the three, and stylistically the most distant from san francisco. you\\'ve seen it done before and you\\'ve seen it done better. even the video game was better! despite the generic non-locality and aimless script, these characters have potential, the actors have talent, and something interesting starts to force its way around the clumsy direction... about ten minutes before the ending. good concept placed in the wrong hands. ps, there is a missing minority here, see if you can guess which one. no holds barred is that movie that when you were nine or ten was the coolest movie this side of arnold schwarzenegger. but then when you grow up and watch it you feel embarrassed that you were so gullible to have liked it. you feel cheated, embarrassed, and stupid. if you have a little brother and you show him this and he tells you it\\'s gay, give him a high five and take him to the strip bar for his eleventh birthday. this movie stinks majorly. the only reason i gave it a 3 was because the graphics were semi charming. it\\'s total disregard for a plot and the lack of even insubstantial surface character development made it seem like just a bunch of nice drawings. this is by far the worse anime that came out of japan. i can\\'t believe they actually put their names on this garbage. what a rip off selling this thing for $20. if you haven\\'t seen this don\\'t bother. if you have, i pity you. this is probably one of the best portuguese movies i ever saw... i absolutely enjoyed the plot, because by the way the story was developing, you would get more involved on how their world was really upside-down... there is just only one part that doesn\\'t really seem to fit in the movie, which is the girls\\' strip... it does not add anything important to the story, it looks like it\\'s just there for a men entertaining purpose. the ending is a bit unexpected, though, at the same time, somewhat expected. if you don\\'t understand, then follow me: after so many strange occurrences, the viewer is so used to oddities, that ending the movie with totally unexpected relationships (like mimoso and susana) sounds totally natural after seeing the rest of the movie. but, most of all, sorte nula is a movie that makes you think hard trying to solve the mysterious occourings, laugh your head off with their unlucky lives and mess with your perception of what can happen in just a few minutes, when you turn your back away from something... for all that, i rate it 8/10 considering the big name cast and lavish production i expected a lot more of this film. the acting for the most part is great, although the story they have to work with is mediocre at best. however the film still warrants watching because of the acting and the stars and some and up and coming young talent. hated it with all my being. worst movie ever. mentally- scarred. help me. it was that bad.trust me!!! there are two kinds of 1950s musicals. first you have the glossy mgm productions with big names and great music. and then you have the minor league with a less famous cast, less famous music and second rate directors. \\'the girl can\\'t help it\\' belongs to the latter category. neither tom ewell or edmond o\\'brien became famous and jayne mansfield was famous for her... well, never mind. seems like every decade has its share of bo dereks or pamela andersons. the plot itself is thin as a razorblade and one can\\'t help suspect that it is mostly an attempt to sell records for fats domino, little richard or others of the 1950s rock acts that appear in the movie. if that music appeals to you this is worth watching. if not, don\\'t bother. this show is wonderful. it has some of the best writing i ever seen. it has brilliant directing by dvid trainer who also directed another smart television series called boy meets world. this show is with out a dought one of the greatest. like three\\'s company, roseanne, and the famous cosby show this will be on television for a long time to come. from it\\'s perfectly crafted jokes to the great performances you would only dream of this is a wonderful show for people who lived in the seventies and the people who didn\\'t. this show appeals to the young and the young at heart. a perfect show. okay people, i have to agree with almost everyone else\\'s reviews here. the characters. are. stupid. they\\'re all stereotypical, and yet have nice clothes and are always skinny. don\\'t even get me started on jamie lynn\\'s role as zoey. zoey is a pretty, popular, tan, blonde young teen who everyone just loves! she has a \"rebellious\", great, personality that everyone agrees with no matter how dumb or extreme it is. most annoying of all: her voice is so darn bubbly and obnoxious. \"omg!\" take for example the first episode. the moment she steps onto the huge pca campus, everyone seems to love her. the boys want to ask her out, the girls want to be her friend, etc. thinking she\\'s all that, the episode plays out with zoey always being the center of attention; she is the so-called best player of the unofficial girls basketball team, confident, and has everyone pity her when she weakly gets hit in the face. oh boo-hoo. my favorite character by far is this whole series is a girl that appears much later into the show, lauren or something, who is the only person ever introduced in the show to hate zoey. and zoey doesn\\'t even seem to be very loyal to her friends sometimes. in one episodes she even calls her friend a freak without ever apologizing and doesn\\'t show the least bit regret in doing so. zoey is always the best: -desiging professional t-shirts and backpacks (which become a big hit) -coming up with very elaborate schemes by herself to teach a single person a lesson. -flawless grades -taking the blame for stuff that wasn\\'t even related to her just so everyone else could be happy. -coming up with a commercial that was so good it was put on tv. the list goes on and on... ugh. she has no acting talent. she\\'s always the perfect person. she acts snotty and rebellious and preppy and...ugh! can\\'t stand her. not only that, but everyone in the show always has great clothes. even the nerd! her wardrobe is better than mine, and mine is pretty freaking decent. no one cares if everyone at pca loves you, zoey, and would do anything for you, even if it meant giving their right arm. but regardless of these cardboard characters, the plots are creative. not everyday things. they\\'re interesting and amusing. the humor is usually good-natured and fun, but the characters are so paper flat that it\\'s hard to enjoy it. this show would be really good if dan schnieder put a bit more time thinking of the type of characters he wanted, because they are so typical, so boring that\\'s it\\'s lame and stupid. point: no one\\'s the least bit overweight, everyone has stylish clothes, zoey is the definition of mary-sue, the story lines are well-thought out, and the humor is laughable. but again, i want to emphasize that the characters taint the show. watch the show if you must, but don\\'t say i didn\\'t warn you if your eyes start to bleed. if alien, jurassic park and countless other sci fi horror movies are your cup of tea, add a lot of sugar and you\\'ll get this one down. the film begins in jolly old england around 1100ad and then jumps to present day california. our hero carver (dean cain) is the new security chief and military advisor for a science lab 400 feet underground. he arrives (carver is also a helicopter pilot) with the lead scientist and we soon find out it\\'s a cloning lab and they have something newly found to clone. is it a dinosaur or what? as with the above movies, all hell breaks loose and our characters start getting picked off. the special effects on the monster are pretty good for a \"direct to video\" movie and dean cain does what he gets paid for. but forget the rest of the group as we find out why we have never seen them before. again, don\\'t go in with high expectations and you\\'ll be ok. i\\'d like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot(!) for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest, crappiest movie i\\'ve ever seen! i have no idea what\\'s wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here (imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings)... the only thing i can imagine is that people must\\'ve voted during one or more conditions: 1. while being shitfaced / stoned out of their minds 2. they\\'ve received hard cash for the votes 3. under gunpoint i can\\'t believe i wasted a good 1 h 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie. if you want to watch a movie and feel good about watching it, then tigerland is the film for you. i love this movie from top to bottom. this movie\\'s picture-perfect scenes look so real; it\\'s almost like a documentary of something that happened in real life but with drama. boy, i tell you... real drama they actually real \"fought\" in one of the scenes (get the dvd listen to the commentary its not obvious). i see this film as a bunch of desperate young men trying to escape an ill-fated destiny, after watching saving private ryan i have an a appreciation of what an \"ill-fated destiny\" is and know exactly how the men in the film feel. i see this movie as a crossbreed between \"stand by me\" and \"saving private ryan.\" what do men do when they are with a situation that\\'s \"hard pressed\" in real life? some men go crazy, some men cry, some men through fists, others do drugs, some randomly sleep with hookers ruthlessly trying to eradicate the meaning of love from their life, some try drink the pain away, some jump off buildings or bridges, some feel guilty and others feel so much agony it makes them so sick they collapse - physically. this movie has all those desperate emotions rolled into one ball. but don\\'t get me wrong its not depressing movie, its realistic, its a very very humorous movie, the cocky and funny bozz (collin\\'s character) lights it all up, and on top of that there are about 5 female actresses in the movie; i\\'ll let you figure out what their in there for! with dialogue, war/action sequences, picture perfect scenes along with appropriate music; this movie has it all, like i said: from top to bottom. i don\\'t why tigerland is heavily under-credited. the best thing about owning the movie is that on the cover it says in big bold writing \"the best film of the year,\" and it absolutely falls nothing short of that. keep the rare gems coming hollywood, 10/10. this is one particular stooge short that actually uses satire in conjunction with slapstick, a rarity. as mentioned, the title and concept for this short was \"borrowed\" from a feature film from the same year with clark gable called \"men in white\". it\\'s basically about the trials and tribulations of interns and their sacred cause for \"duty and humanity\". i saw this recently and almost treated it like the stooge version because it does take itself a little too seriously. in any case, \"men in black\" is so well written, directed and not to mention original, it didn\\'t borrow a thing from chaplin or any of the others, that the motion picture academy nominated it for an award as the best short comedy of 1934. some stinky short called \"la cucaracha\" outdid it though and stole the award. some producer\\'s brother in law must have been on the academy\\'s voting board. \"men in black\" pokes fun at the whole concept of the medical profession much in the same way that the marx bros. always did at this time. may not be a fair comparison but i can see the marx bros. in this short. in fact in their feature \"a day at the races\", there is a scene where there\\'s \"medical things\" going on and they cause anarchy as usual. my guess that this particular short was judged along those lines and hence why it was nominated in the first place. try this in fact: watch this short first and then watch \"duck soup\" or \"day at the races\" with the marxes and then see if there isn\\'t the same great quality of comedy. i can name only a few movies that i have seen which were this bad. this movie has terrible everything: the dialog is corny and clichã©\\', the acting is poor for the most part with a few exceptions, the cinematography is nothing to cheer about, and the plot is silly (a fat woman stalks a suburban family because her daughter didn\\'t make the soccer team). this is so bad, it\\'s funny to watch. if you can catch this on lifetime, i\\'d recommend it highly as a comedy. as for being a serious movie, i\\'m afraid i\\'ll have to rate this a 2. don\\'t watch this film if you are a serious movie fan and looking for an interesting and challenging storyline, or good acting. there is none to be found. edit: hmmm... i think a group of people who work for lifetime must have written some phony reviews and voted all the negative ones down. don\\'t believe them. this is a really crappy movie. when i first read about \"berlin am meer\" i didn\\'t expect much. but i thought with the right people, the right locations, the right music and fashion you could at least make a trivial movie about the hip berlin everyone seems to be talking about. but eissler failed, it\\'s so ridiculously unauthentic. it\\'s a complete misrepresentation of what it is going on in berlin\\'s so called scene. of course it\\'s not all about hippness, but you should expect more from a movie that\\'s being sold as \"the definite berlin movie\". and apart from all the credibility stuff, it really is a bad movie. mediocre acting and a rather boring plot. interestingly some of the actors have proved in other movies that they are actually quite talented. so it really must be poor directing skills. don\\'t bother watching \"berlin am meer\" unless you are 17, come from some small town in western germany and want to move to the big city after you finished school. then you might actually find it enjoyable and totally cool. i got this thing off the sci-fi shelf because i remembered seeing the first of the series when i was a kid. i\\'d rented the second one and it was a decent \"b\" sci-fi. this one was out right obnoxious. the \"special\" effects on the cars looked like something my 4 year old cousin could have done. the two assistant female cyborgs were so terrible that i literally cringed every time they came on the screen. the plot left so much to be desired that it made me sick. i don\\'t know what anyone was thinking when they agreed to be a part of this movie but i\\'m sure that they\\'d have done better to have left it at 2 movies. the movies in this series are going from good to decent to terrible. i only hope that no terrorist groups have access to this movie as it makes an excellent torturing device. waste of my life, .... the director should be embarrassed. why people feel they need to make worthless movies will never make sense to me. when she died at the end, it made me laugh. i had to change the channel many times throughout the film because i was getting embarrassed watching such poor acting. hopefully the guy who played heath never gets work again. on top of that i hope the director never gets to make another film, and has his paycheck taken back for this crap. { .02 out of 10 } a good x evil film with tastes of \"james bond\", \"romeo and juliet\", and, maybe, even \"star wars\". the evil count von bruno receives an english gentleman as a guest for a very dangerous hunt. elga, the beautiful simple and well intentioned lady that was forced to marry the count provides the love triangle. the count missing eye points to a terrible past. the englishman is not what the count thinks and is a terrible treat to him. there is also the terrible hunchback, crocodiles and even the side appearance of some torture instruments. boris karlloff, here in a support role, makes an strong, but somewhat stiff, presence. the other actors (and direction) are the symbol of an era the strong representations of black and white movies. since the beginning there is no doubt of who is the evil guy, who is the good one. even traitors and stiffs can be identified somewhat easily. there is a scene in this film at about the 42 minute mark that is among the worst i have seen in some time. as f. scott fitzgerald (gregory peck) and sheilah graham (deborah kerr) are lounging on the beach, suddenly things become tense and sheilah begins to cry--at which point she tells her lover about her sordid past. this \"dramatic scene\" becomes so terribly overdone and histrionic i couldn\\'t help but turn to my wife and exclaim how stupid it all was...as dramatic music swelled on the television as it all came to a phony crescendo. no one experiences moments like this--no one. now how much of the rest of the film is true, i cannot say, but this particular moment was laughably bad and as fake as an $8 rolex--and leads me to assume that some of the other reviewers were correct--the film is a lot of bunk. however, i am not an expert on the life of these two people and the internet didn\\'t seem to clear this up, either. just who were f. scott fitzgerald and sheilah graham and what was their relationship really like? what i do know about fitzgerald, however, does seem different from what i saw in the film. was he the suave and decent man we initially see in the film? well, considering he was married at the same time he was carrying on with graham and drank like a fish, i\\'d assume he wasn\\'t. was he as obnoxious and boorish as we later see in the film? perhaps, but if he was this bad and yet ms. graham stayed with him, then this makes her out to be a complete dummy--and not someone you\\'d like to see featured in a film. and, if he wasn\\'t, then the film does a poor disservice to his memory. either way, it made for a painful and not particularly pleasant viewing experience. the sum total of this film appears to be a tale of two not particularly likable or healthy people. in a dark and salacious way, some might find this all very entertaining, but most are sure to see this as a train wreck with no surprises along the way! unpleasant but with glossy production values (especially the music, which was lovely but way over the top) it begs the question \"why did they even choose to make this in the first place?\". the bottom line--it\\'s a pretty bad film all around and probably not worth your time--even if, like me, you are big gregory peck fan. a powerful \"real-tv\" movie. very subversive and therefore remaining almost un-broadcasted ! (almost...thanx 2 arte in france). after you\\'ve watched this manhunt all movies filmed with the same concept (a documentary team following the events as they arrived) seem so weak. david this type of plot really does have a lot of potential, but it was butchered here. honestly, i sensed the cheese element in the beginning, but i thought it would get better after the grotesque birthing. whoa, i was wrong! so mad scientist makes a monster, wants to brag to his old cronies before he kills them, but of course they escape. after that, it\\'s really bad. i should\\'ve counted the times the rubber shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage, but i most likely would have lost count. pan down to the blood-dripping-from-severed-leg to show us how the shark-man finds the folks. i hate being spoon-fed every aspect of a horror film. oh, and after being nearly killed by a mutated shark-man and trudging around a jungle-esqe island, there\\'s nothing more cheerful than a middle-aged man reciting shakespeare... this is one where you\\'ll find yourself rooting for the monster... if you can bear to watch this poor excuse for a flick. at the end of my review of cache, i wrote that i was intrigued with haneke as a film maker. this is what led me to get the dvd for la pianiste, which i just finished watching about a half hour ago. it\\'s all been expressed, here at imdb and in many of the external reviews - the gruesomely twisted pathology that would \\'create\\' an individual like huppert\\'s erika, who is still trying, after years and years, to please her mother, at the expense of everyone and everything else in her life, beginning with her self. she\\'s repressed everything that would free her from her self-imposed bondage, including, of course, her sexuality, which has literally imploded, to the point of madness, to where she can no longer even begin to comprehend what a genuine loving impulse would feel like. this is a graphic portrait of a severe emotional cripple, one who never found the strength to get out of her childhood situation and become a functioning adult. i think this subject relates to all of us - we\\'re all striving for autonomy, but there are needs, so many conflicting needs, most of which are not even on the conscious level. it also deals brilliantly with the contrast between what one fantasizes about, sexually, and the reality of those fantasies, as well as the consequences of choosing to share one\\'s sexual fantasies with another human being. huppert\\'s character gets what she asks for in the course of the film, and it is hardly the emancipating experience she had imagined it to be. regarding the much-discussed scene in the bathroom: i really appreciated how this sequence had all the possible erotic charge (for the viewer, i mean) sucked out of it because of the prior scene, where she put the glass in the girl\\'s pocket. by the time she\\'s acting out her let\\'s-see-if-this-guy-is-worthy scenario in the bathroom, we\\'ve already found out that she\\'s dangerously disturbed and so it\\'s not a turn on, her little domination session with our poor unsuspecting dupe. i think another incredible achievement of this movie is how, about halfway through it, i completely forgot that it was not in english and that i was reading sub-titles. that has never happened before, in any foreign movie, and i\\'ve seen quite a few. in this film, like cache, the ending is not all wrapped up in a nice little tidy bow, but unlike cache, we do at least get some sense of finality, despite the fact that we do not even know for sure whether huppert\\'s character is alive or dead. after experiencing la pianiste, when it comes to michael haneke, i am, needless to say, more than a trifle intrigued. this series had potential, but i suppose the budget wouldn\\'t allow it to see that potential. an interesting setup, not dissimilar to \"lost\" it falls flat after the 1st episode. the whole series, 6 episodes, could have made a compelling 90 minute film, but the makers chose to drag it on and on. many of the scenes were unbearably slow and long without moving the action forward. the music was very annoying and did not work overall. there were few characters we cared about as their characters did not grow during the time frame--- well, one grew a bit. the ending was as terrible as the rest of series. the only kudos here is to the art dept and set dressers, they created an interesting look, too bad the writer and director lacked the foresight to do something interesting with that element independent film that would make hollywood proud. the movie substitutes good looks for good acting, a cryptic plot for a good story line, and self-absorption for character development. may be i missed something, go see it for yourself. most of you out there really disliked this movie... you were right. a small minority of you really loved the movie... can\\'t say you\\' re wrong. for me, this movie was too stupid. i have seen many dumb, silly comedies but this one surpasses every one of them. as i was watching i couldn\\'t stop rubbing my eyes, not believing what i was seeing and trying to decide if i should laugh or cry, as *really stupid* stuff were going on on the screen, and people were leaving the theater. according to the leading characters, time travel is accomplished, just enter any museum and you will actually travel to the past. plus, if you are seeking an after death experience, just go to the nearest planetarium, there you shall meet lord - sorry, loydd and be given important commands... all te above doesn\\' t really make sense, right? well, go ahead, watch the movie (i almost never regret the movies i watch), you probably won\\'t like it, but you will be intrigued by the writer\\'s ability in producing the ultimately stupid script... i\\' m giving it a 3 out of 10, not good, far from being the worse... despite all the hoopla about the trouble with tribbles episode, the balance of terror might just be the best episode of the series. and, while i have always loved a piece of the action because it is so much fun, i really do have to cast my vote as this romulan episode as being the very best. the movie, interestingly enough, is really like a wwii submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked romulan ship and the enterprise as it seeks to destroy the romulans before they sneak back across the neutral zone after a raid on federation outposts. in so many ways, the show is much like the film the enemy below--where the american captain (robert mitchum) and the german captain (curt jurgens) are shown in counter-point as they both try to outwit the other--and in the process develop a grudging respect for their foe. interestingly enough, only a short bit of the beginning of the episode takes place on a planet--and this is amazing because an episode on board ship could easily have been static and dull. but, because the writing was so fantastic and the main characters written and acted so well (shatner and mark leonard as the romulan leader). oddly, for the die-hard trekkers out there, they\\'ll recognize leonard as the same actor who later played spock\\'s father. the bottom line is this is simply a great and extremely engaging episode that will keep you on the edge of your seat. i will divide my review into following 5 categories each accounting a maximum of 100%(if perfect) ________________________________________________________________ visual pleasure:[100%] this is extremely pleasing movie visually. i had a great time watching it. golfing scenes are very well shot and the dramatic effects on the green were quite amazing. i also loved seeing the old wooden golf clubs and the bag. director\\'s work:[70%] bill paxton is more associated to acting but this film shows he\\'s got talent. did a decent job. acting:[90%] shia lebeouf was very good in his role of francis ouimet(this guy can act well). the rest of the cast was also good. entertainment value:[100%] i enjoyed every minute of it. it was overwhelmingly entertaining. script:[91%] based on a true story and therefore it makes the film that much more special. it was intriguing right from the start and loved every scene till the very end. __________________________________________________________________ my advice: definitely a must watch for all the sports lovers especially golf(you all will love it). anyone who is looking for a nice entertaining movie and doesn\\'t hate sports can watch it. _____ 10/10 after seeing this film i felt sick to my stomach and if i had seen one more minute i would have had to rush to the bathroom and vomit til dawn. a sick film that was not funny and was not worth the money, any money at all. if anybody ever wants to see this movie don\\'t! your kids will never forgive you and will claim sickness for a week. so if you value your child\\'s education and want to stimulate your child\\'s mind please don\\'t see this movie. i beg of you, don\\'t! this was one of my favorites as a child. my family had the 8-track tape soundtrack!! it took us years (until i was in my 20s) for us to get a video of the movie (my dad taped it from hbo or something). every summer when we go to the beach (my mom, brother, sister and i) we lay on the beach and sing all the songs from this movie!!! loved it!!! i have to confess that i know some of those involved, i was in the forerunner to the planet, evil unleased, however this was more than 10 years ago and i had since lost contact with them. i happened to be watching bbc scotland news and a piece regarding scottish cinema, this mentioned and showed clips from the planet and comments from it\\'s director mark stirton, this prompted me to order a copy of the film on dvd. now to the film, the level of acting, writing, directing and sfx is up there with some of the best around, ok it\\'s not star wars but i\\'ve seen many a hollywood product that is far inferior. it is very strange watching a film spoken in my local north east scotland accent but that soon passed. ^mild spoilers^ the planet draws on several sci-fi classics; star wars, alien, pitch black, forbidden planet and predator, a handful of the merchant crew of a deep space transport ship survive their craft being attacked and destroyed by unknown ships, they escape onto a deserted desert planet, one by one they are killed by invisible attackers, the ships only passenger, a mysterious prisoner also makes it to the planet, a battle ensues as the crew fight to survive. the planet is a brilliant piece of sci-fi film making that certainly hides it\\'s limited budget, well done to mark, mike and all those involved, i look forward to your next work. i purchased a dvd of this film for a dollar at the big dept store. that\\'s probably the best and kindest comment i have to offer on it. at least it didn\\'t cheat me out of the cost of lunch. the problem with \"chiller\" is craven\\'s problem as a director. the man has his apologists who claim his traveling papers prove he\\'s a really smart guy and all-around sharp conceptualist. but it\\'s no secret that, as a director, he has never possessed one iota of the visual and story-telling sense of a hitchcock. as vigorously attested by \"chiller\", he\\'s much closer to that legendary flat-foot hershel gordon lewis. what craven lacks as a director is the main ingredient that would lift him from director for hire to a higher plane of film- making. let\\'s be specific. the transitional moments of this film are sleek. the establishing shots give it the feel of a quality production. the film looks professionally put together, in the way a film shot by a tv commercial director would. (a thought: the films only visual distinction, these transitions that at least look professionally handled may very well be the work of some second unit directors.) it\\'s the parts between the bridges and smooth transitions -- the drama -- that fall flat. the core of the proceedings are invariably perfunctorily handled. the critical shots (after, say, the departing car drives into the well-positioned camera, then we cut to the night exterior of a hospital, then to the waiting area and hallway, then to the phone booth in the corner that will figure in the next bit of action) are quickly dispensed so we can hurry up and get to the next part. craven never comes anywhere close to exploding the dramatic or visual possibilities of any moment. the net result of all this misplaced attention to the least important parts, and the fumbling rush to keep things moving, is a film that feels like the work of the fledgling art student who sharpens all his pencils, fussily adjusts his easel and lighting set-up, grinds all his pigments, stretches and primes his canvas ...and then has nothing to say. craven, like the art student, never gets to the meat of the exercise. for craven apologists who will point out that this film was made for tv, i will point to spielberg\\'s \"duel\" and say no more. excellent. gritty and true portrayal of pioneer ranch life on the western plains with an emphasis on the woman\\'s role and place. a moving film, lovingly made, and based on real people and their actual experiences. low budget, independent film; never made any money. definitely not the romanticized, unrealistic hollywood version of pioneer life. i was taken to this film by a friend and was sceptical about a swedish film with subtitles. however, i thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this beautiful film. the unnecessary cruelty that man is capable of was portrayed confidently without overwhelming images - although animal lovers may have to shield their eyes for a brief couple of seconds somewhere during the first 10 minutes. a traditional story of humility versus brutality and hope versus tragedy was illustrated from a satisfyingly fresh angle using a spectrum of characters with very natural flaws and features. i particularly liked how the film managed to address multiple aspects of hypocritical human behaviour that concern bias, discrimination and sanctimonious pretence. an absolute gem of a film that i will promote to all who will listen. \"homeward bound: the incredible journey\" is one of those wonderful old movies about house pets. deserves a place among the great movies of its genre and even the cinema world in general, together with other animal movies like \"old yeller\", \"napoleon\", \"fluke\" and \"air bud\". this means it is more than just a movie about pets. can this possibly be just a \"remake\"? it is too good to be a \"remake\"! i know this one by heart, since my early teen years (when i was 12). it\\'s a family movie to treasure. it\\'s emotional, thrilling, adventurous, exciting, entertaining, humorous, charming, sweet, nostalgic, beautiful, heartwarming and sometimes dramatic. it\\'s one of those movies to put a smile on the faces of those who appreciate this kind of films. this movie does not lack qualities. it has a well thought story, enjoyable characters, excellent and relaxing instrumental soundtrack, dazzling sceneries/landscapes of the magnificent sierra mountains (in oregon). speaking of the vistas, it\\'s not all mountains: forests, trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunsets... in conclusion, all of pure nature\\'s wonders - truly a full panorama. the main human characters are nice, well developed and well portrayed by respective actors. robert hays is awesome as the kind-hearted dad, bob seaver. kim greist is good as laura burnford. veronica lauren is equally good as hope. kevin chevalia is conventional as the youngest and cute brother jamie (his appearance actually reminds me very much of kevin corcoran in \"old yeller\"). benj thall is great as peter burnford. when it comes to our quadruped pals, shadow is my favorite. shadow is the loyal, wise, mature, beautiful, caring and loving old golden retriever (brilliantly voiced by don ameche). chance, the american bulldog, is the opposite of shadow. he is carefree, silly, impatient, anxious, clumsy, hilarious and loves to play (voiced by the talented michael j. fox). chance just can\\'t stand still. sassy is the epitome of cats\\'s image: elegant, independent, very confident and self-proud, with a typical cat attitude but with a certain feline charm. sassy is a seal point himalayan cat, one of the most beautiful cat breeds. sassy is voiced by sally field, who also does a good job. our four-legged friends are, themselves, great \"actors\" by nature: ben as shadow, rattler as chance and tiki as sassy. it\\'s an underrated movie, but a classic by its own right. its sequel is clearly inferior. this should definitely be on top 250. to review this movie, i without any doubt would have to quote that memorable scene in tarantino\\'s \"pulp fiction\" (1994) when jules and vincent are talking about mia wallace and what she does for a living. jules tells vincent that the \"only thing she did worthwhile was pilot\". vincent asks \"what the hell is a pilot?\" and jules goes into a very well description of what a tv pilot is: \"well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. that show\\'s called a \\'pilot\\'. then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they\\'re going to make more shows. some pilots get picked and become television programs. some don\\'t, become nothing. she starred in one of the ones that became nothing.\" now to stretch on what jules was talking about, there are billions of television shows/pilots that were never aired because they simply were not...well, good. probably the most notorious pilot that comes to mind is \"w*a*l*t*e*r\", a spin-off to \"m*a*s*h\" with gary \"radar\" burghoff as the lead. hmmm, would somebody really want to be watching radar for a half-hour trying to solve crimes? hence, the show was never picked up. what many people don\\'t know (or what they thought they knew) is that pilots are hardly ever shown on the air, for they are made strictly for the television networks for them to decide. some have made they\\'re way past and got onto the air (the pilot for the animated series \"american dad\" comes to mind, as the show\\'s serial itself didn\\'t begin until nearly four months later. however, there are times were we should all be glad pilots never make it to air, and this here is why. \"black bart\", a supposed tie-in with the mel brooks comedy classic, \"blazing saddles\", is a stale and bland \"sitcom\" with little heart and no soul. \"saddles\" was a controversial comedy, nevertheless, with it\\'s racist humor and vulgar comedy, which comes to mind \"what idiot decided this would make a great television show for prime time tv?!?\" i say \"supposed\", because none of the memorable characters from the movie, aside from bart, on in this mess of a tv show. mel brooks wasn\\'t even involved with the production of the serial and this was the first mistake in a long line (in a related story, i recently found out about an unaired tv pilot for a series based on the movie \"clerks.\" that kevin smith was no involved in....you see what happens?!?). set somewhere around the same time as the movie (or at all), the story circles around the only black sheriff in the wild west, named appropriately \\'black\\' bart, who is this time played by future academy award winner louis gossett jr., obviously before his stint in \"real\" acting, whereas in this he is playing a \"g-rated\" richard pryor. most of the other characters are carbon (if not, really bad) copies of the characters in the movie: jim, the waco kid is replaced by a similar looking character named reb jordan, a former confederate soldier who is quick with the gun. lilian von schtupp is now belle buzzer, a more of a ripoff of the character being that she\\'s a show dancer and a german with a marlene dietrich-type accent and personality. while that\\'s pretty much the end in similarities, the lead \"bad guy\" in the story is fern malaga, played by noble willingham, who i assumed would\\'ve been hedley lamar if warner bros. secured the rights to the name (see trivia for \"blazing saddles\") and his son curley...i dunno, taggart i suppose? the story is a poor excuse for a sitcom, much less a pilot. bart deals with the mayor\\'s drunk son and he\\'s out-of-control behavior which has caused the town to spin. really, it\\'s a story that tries to introduce all the characters in the \"series\" and doesn\\'t focus on the variety and context that would make this an \"alright\" show. i can\\'t really call it a sitcom (and even if i wanted to) and that\\'s primarily the fact it was shot on the backlot at warner bros. studios and later added a laugh track, so the show is set up almost exactly like \"m*a*s*h\" (complete with a bland and dull \"laughing\" that is identical to the series). the acting is so-so, but there\\'s one part that always make me laugh, and that\\'s when the actor playing reb jordan almost seems to forget his lines and tries really hard to remember them while trying to sputter out a piece of dialogue. ha! the script is rather dull and is attempts to make racism more humorous than it was in the movie (surprisingly, they use the word \"n***er\" numerous amount of times through a 22-minute episode, rather touchy for it\\'s time period and even for today) and it gets repetitive. if you ever get your hands on this unseen piece of sssss...surly interesting novelty item, watch it just for the sake of the feeling for watching pilots (it\\'s on the collector\\'s edition of \"blazing saddles\", god knows why). there, yourself get a first hand chance for the reason why many movie tie-in pilots never air. oy vey... jurrasic park got corman-ized. as usual the plot is wafer thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are, to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs (i\\'ve seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes). and all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film. all the male actors are imbeciles (thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert, constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill) and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for fredrick\\'s of hollywood. the raptor itself is the worst thing since the hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the \"motion\" shots. if you want a good movie to sit around and heckle mst3k style, this is gold. if you want competent film making and good acting... don\\'t watch a roger corman film. acting gets a 4 out 10, some of the players upon this stage did try. story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad. special effects gets a 2 out of 10, i\\'ve seen worse, but not many. this film revolves around an arabian leader (amir) who dies and wants to live on. so a dr. lloyd trenton is being paid to transplant amirs brain into a \"willing\" participant. but in the doctors basement his dwarf assistant dorro (angelo rossitto) drains young girls blood for the doctors purposes. so meanwhile doctor llyod pays a man to kill the people who assisted amir into the country (which is reed hadley, grant williams, and various unknown bodyguards.). grant is the only survivor when his car crashes off the road. while this has happened the doctors other assistant gor is sent out to get a body for amir and hurts him so badly dr.llyod cant operate. meanwhile, grant finds amirs \"girlfriend\" regina carrol and tells her his story. grant sees the man who drove him off the road and dorro kills him. then since gor failed to get a body d.r llyod puts amirs brain into gors disfigured body. then grant and regina go to the doctors lab an ------------------------spoilers------------------------- find out his secret. soon amir (gor) are prancing around killing people and in the muddle of what i think is plot dr.llyod has a brain-ray gun which hurts amir on command. it turns out dr.lloyd wants a country in which all scientists can work without law. so then regina dies. and at the end amirs new body (i think) say that it shall be a new country blah blah. i still don\\'t get the ending but overall this was a very enjoyable piece of smelly cheese.this film features grant williams in his second to last film roll. i recommend it for any fan of al adamson or if you like brains. in his first go as a hollywood director, henry brommell whips an enthralling yarn that is all of penetrating relatable marital issues with melancholic authenticity, and lacing such with an equally absorbing subplot of a father-son hit-man business. the film is directed astutely and consists of a wonderfully put together cast as well as a swift, family-conscious screenplay (also by brommell) that brings life to an otherwise fatigued genre. as a bonus, \\'panic\\' delivers subtle, acerbic humorâ—an unexpected, undeniably charming, and very welcome surpriseâ—through its bumbling, unsure-of-himself, low-key star, whose ever-cool state is enticing, especially given his line of work. the forever-great william h. macy again captures our hearts as alex, a unhappy, torn, middle-aged husband and father who finds solace in the most dubious of persons: a young, attractive, equally-messed-up 23-year-old named sarah (neve campbell), whom he meets in the waiting-room at a psychologist\\'s office, where he awaits the therapy of dr. josh parks (john ritter) to discuss his growing eagerness to quit the family business that his father (donald sutherland) built. alex, whose lust to lead a new life is obstructed by the fear of disappointing his dictating father, strikes an unwise fancy for sarah, which ultimately leads him to understand the essence and irrefutable responsibility of being a husband to his wife and, more importantly to him, a good father to his six-year-old son, sammy (played enthusiastically by the endearing david dorfman). henry brommell\\'s brilliant \\'panic\\' is something of a rarity in hollywood seldom seen (with the exception of 2002\\'s \\'road to perdition\\') since its conception in 2000â—it weaves two conflicting genres (organized-crime, family drama) into a fascinating, warm hunk of movie-viewing that is evenly strong in either directionâ—and it\\'s one that will maintain its exceptional, infrequent caliber and gleaming sincerity for ages to come. after perusing the large amount of comments on this movie it is clear that there are two kinds of science fiction movie-goers. there are the ones who are well read, extremely literate, and intelligent. they know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what heights it can reach in the hands of a gifted author. for many years science fiction languished in the basement of literature. considered my most critic to be little more than stories of ray guns and aliens meant for pre-pubescent teenagers. today\\'s well read fan knows well this history, and knows the great authors asimov, heinlein, bradbury, and ellison, who helped bring science fiction out of that basement. in doing so they created thought provoking, intelligent stories that stretched the boundaries and redefined the human condition. this well informed fans are critical of anything hollywood throws at them. they are not critical for it\\'s own sake, but look upon each offering with a skeptical eye. (as they should as hollywood\\'s record has been less than stellar.) to these fans the story must take supreme importance. they cannot be fooled by flashy computer graphics, and non stop action sequences. when the emperor has no clothes they scream it the loudest. the second type of science fiction movie goer has little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre. (look at many of the above comments that state \"well i haven\\'t read the book or anything by this author...) their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the scifi channel. they are extremely uncritical, willing to overlook huge plot holes, weak premises, and thin story lines if they are given a healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effects. they are, in effect, willing to turn off their critical thinking skills (or maybe they never had them!) for the duration of the movie. case in point, i robot. while supposedly based on asimov\\'s short stories and named after one of his novels, it contains little of what asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations. (those of you that will run out and buy i, robot will be very much surprised-this movie isn\\'t even based on that story at all!) the film has enormous plot holes, that at some points are stretched to the limits of credulity. i won\\'t point them out. i won\\'t spoon feed you. you need to practice you thinking skills and discover them for yourself. the characters, which are named after many of asimov\\'s characters, do not possess the critical intelligence that was a hallmark of his stories. the plot itself with all it\\'s action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for. his belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds, not their fists, is vital to understanding his vision of the future. in short, other than the name, their is very little of isaac in anything about this movie. there will always be those uncritical (i.e. unthinking) who will state: \"the movie doesn\\'t have to be like the book. due to the medium, movies sometimes require that changes be made.\" but what about a case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book (or books) from the start? what if all they took from the written work was the title? this begs the question: why tarnish a great body of work by slapping it\\'s title on your vacuous piece of crap? save money and don\\'t buy the rights to the works. title it something else. don\\'t use the character\\'s names. believe me no one will accuse you of plagiarism. in fact it won\\'t matter what you title it to the unread moviegoer who accepts everything you throw at him. but it will upset those who read, who think, who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show. i, robot, like much of hollywood\\'s take on the genre, pushes science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago. hollywood could not do this alone. it takes an uncritical mindless audience that will accept puerile dredge like this. one of the few comedic twilight zones that\\'s actually really good. we have floyd the barber from andy griffith show,the stock in trade old geezer dude from many old westerns,and lovable old frisby. it also has that cool spacecraft interior that i believe was used in the sci fi classic forbidden planet.or else the day the earth stood sill.plus the new guys in town are driving an exotic renault(i think) sports car back in the days when european automobiles were known as \"foreign jobs\" in the u.s.. the whole idea of harmonica as weapon is a hoot.and the fact that frisby\\'s buddies love him despite being the fact he\\'s a total bs artist is a heartwarming moment. i was expecting a very funny movie. instead, i got a movie with a few funny jokes, and many that just didn\\'t work. i didn\\'t like the idea of bringing in sherlock holmes\\' and moriarty\\'s descendants. it was confusing. it would have been more funny if they just had someone new, instead of moriarty resurrected. some of the things were funny. burt kwouk was very funny, as always. mccloud on the horse was funny. the mcgarrett from hawaii 5-0 was not even mcgarrett-like. connie booth obviously is very good with accents. she is from indiana, but played english and a new yorker pretty well. unfortunately, she was not presented much into the script. i was expecting a more funny film. instead, i got a rather confusing movie with a poor script. rather ironic, since both booth and cleese were together on this one. maybe they were about to break up in 77. this movie is incredibly realistic and i feel does a great justice to the crime that many people do not understand because of a lack of experience. the many people who think they could fathom what goes through a victim\\'s mind are arrogant. as a victim, i feel that dawson did a fantastic job in her role of maya. i agree that this is an incredibly brave film. this looks at rape from a different, more realistic standpoint than any other movie i\\'ve ever seen on the subject. the end did drag on a bit long, but i know that many victims imagine this kind of justice, since the chances of an attacker being sent to jail for their crime is around 1%. it\\'s good to see a movie that sticks closer to reality than most would dare to. what i like about you\\' is definitely a show that i couldn\\'t wait to see each day. amanda bynes is such an excellent actress and i grew up watching her show: \\'the amanda show.\\' she\\'s a very funny person and seems to be down to earth. \"holly\" is such a like-able person and has an \"out-there\" personality. i enjoyed how she always seemed to turn things around and upside down, so she messed herself up at times. but that\\'s what made the show so great. i especially loved the show when the character \\'vince\\' came along. nick zano is very hot and funny, as well as \\'gary\\', wesley jonathan. the whole cast was great, each character had their own personality and charm. jennie garth, allison munn, and leslie grossman were all very interesting. i especially loved \\'lauren\\'; she\\'s the best! she helped make the show extra funny and you never know what she\\'s gonna do or say next! overall the show is really nice but the reason i didn\\'t give it a 10 was because there\\'s no more new episodes and because the episodes could\\'ve been longer and more deep. i am not an artistically inclined individual. i am a science minded woman and i felt that this movie was maybe one of those campy artsy type films on a budget. i watched part of it with my fiancã© and my future step daughter. we tried very hard to find something in this film to keep our interest. my fiancã© and his daughter voted it off and we moved on to ocean\\'s 13,but that is another story. not to be deterred i awoke the next morning and gave the movie another shot. i began again watching this movie in earnest. i just don\\'t get it,i thought i would get it.i thought the funniest part was the flushing of the ashes and the urn finding a spot by the fireplace being used as a vase for what appeared to be dead flowers. interesting and still it had dead stuff inside. it was an odd and bizarre movie. maybe this is what they were after,however i won\\'t be tricked a second time! -spoiles- lame south of the border adventure movie that has something to do with the blackmail of a big cooperate executive rosenlski the president of unasco inc. by on the lamb beachcomber david ziegler who\\'s living the life of reilly, or ziegler, in his beach house in cancun mexico.having this cd, that he gave to his brother james, that has three years of phone conversations between rosenlski and the president of the united states involved in criminal deals. this cd has given david an edge over the international mobsters who are after him. the fact that james get\\'s a little greedy by trying to shake down rosenlski for 2 million in diamonds not only cost him his life but put david in danger of losing his as well. ropsenlski want\\'s to negotiate with david for the cd by getting his ex-wife liz to talk to him about giving it up, rosnelski made a deal to pay off her debts if she comes through. david is later killed by rosenliski\\'s mexican hit-man tony, with the help of a great white shark, who just doesn\\'t go for all this peaceful dealings on his boss\\' part. tony had taken the cd that liz left for his boss at a local hotel safe and now want\\'s to murder james, like he did david, and at the same time keep the cd to have something over rosenlski. david who had secretly hidden the diamonds that james had on him at the time of his murder is now the target of tony and his men to shut him up for good. david also wants to take the diamonds and at the same time give his boss rosenlski the impression that the cd that david had is lost but use it later, without rosenlski knowing who\\'s behind it,to blackmail him. the movie \"night of the sharks\" has a number of shark attacks in it with this huge one-eyed white shark who ends up taking out about a half dozen of the cast members including tony. david who\\'s a firm believer in gun-control uses knives high explosives and molotov cocktails, as well as his fists, to take out the entire tony crew. even the killer shark is finished off by tony but with a hunting knife, not a gun. when it came to using firearms to save his friend and sidekick paco a girlfriend juanita and his priest father mattia lives from tony and his gang guns were a no-no with david; he was more of a knife and spear man then anything else. the ending of the movie was about as predictable as you can make it with david thought to be killed by the one-eyed shark later pops up out of the crowd,after rosenlski was convinced that he\\'s dead and leaves the village. david continues his life as a free living and loving beachcomber with no one looking to kill him and about two million dollars richer. to david\\'s credit he had his friend paco give rosenski back his cd but under the conditions that if anything happened to him his cousin, who rosenlski doesn\\'t know who and where he is, will shoot his big mouth off and let the whole world know about his dirty and criminal dealings. the turning point in \"the matador\" comes about half through the movie when danny, an unsophisticated man from denver, is sitting in the balcony of his mexico city hotel, enjoying a quiet moment. someone knocks on his door, and knowing it\\'s julian, the paid assassin, he refuses to answer. but did he really? richard shephard, the director of \"the matador\", presents us with a character, julian noble, who shows no redeemable qualities. in fact, we have already seen him in action, doing what he does best. when julian meets danny at the bar of the camino real in mexico city, he spills the beans and tells his new acquaintance what he really does for a living. danny, who has come to sell his program to a mexican company, but it seems he is competing against a local outfit that appears to be in the front for getting the contract. danny is a naive person who falls prey of the charisma and charm doled out by the smarter julian. it\\'s not until some time later, on a cold winter night that the killer appears at danny\\'s door asking his friend to repay a favor and accompany him on a trip to tucson. it\\'s at this point that the secret that binds them together is revealed in an unexpected way. pierce brosnan, acting against type, makes a great contribution with his irreverent julian noble. just to watch him walking through the hotel lobby in his speedo and boots gives the right impression about his character. greg kinnear, on the other hand, plays the straight part of this odd couple. hope davis appears only in a couple of scenes leaving us to lament why didn\\'t she stay longer. philip baker hall puts an appearance as the liaison between julian and his assignments. richard shephard directs with style working with his own material. the musical score is by rolfe kent and the crisp cinematography of david tattersall enhances everything. those who only remember the late sir peter ustinov as hercule poirot or a professional raconteur would do well to seek out this charming piece of late \\'60s satire. ustinov stars as a convicted embezzler (we first see him during his last day in gaol where he is preparing the prison governor\\'s tax return) who, sensing that the future is in computers, poses (by means of a deft piece of identity theft) as a computer expert and sets out to infiltrate an american multinational. ustinov (who co-wrote the script) is on top form, as is the delightful maggie smith, here unusually cast as an accident-prone cockney-sparrow dolly bird. bob newhart also puts in an amusing performance as a suspicious executive who has designs on maggie smith. in addition, karl malden is satisfyingly sleazy as ustinov and newhart\\'s womanising boss. what do i particularly like about this film? not only is it a well-thought-out \\'caper movie\\' but it\\'s also a touching little love story; ustinov and smith are very convincing as the two misfits stumbling into love (the whole scene involving the deck of cards is particularly effective.) so, what is there not to like? well, the script is no more computer-literate than most films (that is, hardly at all) even though it captures the feel of late \\'60s \\'big iron\\' business computing quite well. also there are a couple of small plot glitches that you\\'re not likely to notice until the second or third viewing, but i consider these to be minor niggles. as i said, this is a film which is well worth seeking out, and after you\\'ve seen it once you\\'ll want to see it again at regular intervals. absolutely wonderful drama and ros is top notch...i highly recommend this movie. her performance, in my opinion, was academy award material! the only real sad fact here is that universal hasn\\'t seen to it that this movie was ever available on any video format, whether it be tape or dvd. they are ignoring a very good movie. but universal has little regard for its library on dvd, which is sad. if you get the chance to see this somewhere (not sure why it is rarely even run on cable), see it! i won\\'t go into the story because i think most people would rather have an opinion on the film, and too many \"reviewers\" spend hours writing about the story, which is available anywhere. a 10! the influence of hal hartley in adrienne shelly\\'s \"i\\'ll take you there\" is not overt, but clearly has ties to his work (shelly has acted in two of hartley\\'s films). not only does her film exhibit a very tight narrative, but the hyper-stylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in a very real light. though this film is not ironic on the whole (thank god), the small and subtle ironies that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss. with beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies, \"i\\'ll see you there\" is a great indie-film that doesn\\'t stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotion. the film begins with bill\\'s life falling to pieces. not only has he sold his best friend ray a beautiful country home, but his wife rose has left him in order to join ray in the retreat. all washed up, bill wallows in his own gloom and doom until his sister lucy (played by the director adrienne shelly) brings him all kinds of surprises: a self-help book and a \"date\" for her traumatized brother. the unwilling bill tries to refuse, but the sudden appearance of bernice at his door leaves him no choice. no doubt bernice\\'s initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from his ability to \"rebound\" with her. however, her pseudo-hippie qualities annoy him so much that he lashes at her on their first date. and bernice is so traumatized by his derogatory remarks that she attaches herself to him, forcing herself upon him. to what end, we are not aware... except for maybe the fact that she is psycho. (and who better to play the psycho than ally sheedy?) aware that bill desperately wants to see rose, bernice offers her car, but on the condition that he take her somewhere first. on the way, she proceeds to hold bill prisoner with his own gun (a pinkerton detective, no less). an imbroglio of angst, resentment, redemption, passion and violence ensue as bill and bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of ray and rose... of course, with a few stops along the way. when in 1982, \"the thing\" came out to theaters everywhere, it had a cold reception and very poor box-office results, becoming almost a failure in john carpenter\\'s career as a horror director; however, time has proved that \"the thing\" was definitely not a failed project and that the disappointing commercial results were not the film\\'s fault. nowadays, john carpenter\\'s \"the thing\" has gained the appreciation it rightfully deserves and is considered by many horror fans as a horror classic, and not without a reason, as this new version of john w. campbell, jr.\\'s story \"who goes there?\" (previously adapted as \"the thing from another world\") is closer to the original tale and keeps a pessimistic feeling of dread and high doses of suspense in a masterfully crafted study about paranoia. the plot of \"the thing\", begins in the winter of 1982 in a u.s. research station located in the remote territories of antarctica, when the members of the crew notice a norwegian helicopter coming their way. the two apparently insane pilots of the helicopter are trying to kill a husky dog who makes its way into the american base. after the norwegians are killed accidentally, the americans try to figure out what made them to be insane. soon they\\'ll discover that the husky dog the norwegians were hunting was not a normal dog, but a creature able to mimic every living creature, and not only that, it has a tremendous hunger. director john carpenter earned a place in history when in 1978 he directed the seminal slasher \"halloween\", where suspense and atmosphere were above gore and shock. \"the thing\" could be seen as an evolution of that style, as even when carpenter makes great use of rob bottin\\'s special effects (which were labeled by critics as \"repulsive\" on its day), the film still focuses more on atmosphere and suspense rather than in the violent (and very well-done) displays of gore. the feeling of loneliness, as well as the \"bad karma\" between the members of the crew increase the feeling of paranoia as anyone could be the thing, even our main character, r. j. macready (kurt russell), ending in a situation where nobody can be trusted. this plot element was more faithful to the concept of the source novel, and was blatantly ignored by the previous version (not completely a bad thing, just a big difference), making this version feel less like a remake and more as a new conception of the source novel. bill lancaster\\'s script handles the characters with brilliant domain, giving us enough to distinguish them, but not too much to completely trust them, making them an essential factor in the film\\'s haunting feeling of dread that keeps running through the movie. the mystery and the suspense are at the max, as never one can tell who is the thing and who is normal, enhancing the paranoia and unpredictability of the plot with excellent results. the cast is very effective, and their performances as a whole so effective that one can almost feel the bad feelings between their characters as real. carpenter\\'s regular collaborator kurt russell as macready carries the film, and through his eyes we witness the madness and the horror the research station becomes as the situations goes worse. definitely one of his best performances. wilford brimley is also terrific as dr. blair, a scientist that goes insane after discovering the thing\\'s purposes. \"the thing\" is a film so wonderfully crafted that its flaws tend to go unnoticed, although they exist. the most notorious being the very low-key and at times unappropriated score by ennio morricone. it\\'s not exactly bad, but it just feels out of place at some scenes and it\\'s not one of the best works by the legendary composer. also, due to some misshapes with the special effects, some scenes were left out that actually fill some small plot holes, although nothing of big importance or actually annoying. when talking about john carpenter\\'s films, most people will almost instantly name \"halloween\" as his favorite film, but personally, i would go with \"the thing\", as i consider it carpenter\\'s greatest achievement so far, and one of the most interesting and actually scary horror films ever made. i would go as far as to call it one of the finest films ever made. 10/10 here\\'s one you can watch with a straight face, with a script so bad, even will ferrell wouldn\\'t be in it. there are two laughs in hot rod. 1. the punch-dance. rod \"needs to go to his quiet place\" and before anyone can say kevin bacon, he is footloosing a passionate, overwrought bodyswerve to the strains of a band who wishes they had the big-hair faux-metal chops of europe. 2. john farnham\\'s you\\'re the voice. in one of those epic sequences where the star and his cohorts do the slomo walk down main street and the townfolk follow on their heels in support, the soundtrack is the gag. how did the film-makers even come across this aussie recording artist? a major australian vocalist (and a genuine talent) who shot to fame in the early \\'70s covering raindrops keep fallin\\' on my head, then disappeared until 1986 for the big comeback with you\\'re the voice, john farnham\\'s anthem is so bewitchingly cheesy, it leveled mountains in switzerland. besides these two high points in the film - both ruined anyway with the slipshod writing - the rest of the film is like choking on someone else\\'s vomit. andy samberg is rod, a failed stunt jumper who has never made a jump. maybe it\\'s got something to do with the fact he\\'s driving a moped into the heart of darkness. or his fake mustache. yeh, someone actually thought that was funny. without one jump under his starry belt, he plans for a 15-bus extravaganza - which would surely kill a lesser bad comedian, like jason biggs or rob schneider - to win the day and save his stepfather and simultaneously wipe out cancer and whatever... who watches these movies for plot anyway? along the way (as usual for moronic leads in these comedies), he scores a salubrious chick (isla fisher), who must surely be retarded to consider swapping chromosomes with this loser. sissy spacek (carrie, 1976) has so little to do she almost phoned in her performance - then changed her mind and just hung up. ian mcshane must\\'ve lost a bet to be here. if you liked lock, stock and two smoking barrels, the chances are you\\'ll like this, too. although i guess a few of the british in-jokes (like calling two london characters dixon and winterburn, after arsenal soccer players) may be lost on some, this is still cracking entertainment, which veritably pumps with vitality. carlyle, miller and tyler are all excellent, bringing depth to their characters, and the interplay between the two protagonists is always well-judged. in fact scott\\'s direction is very assured, considering that this is his first feature film, and proves that he has his father\\'s talent for putting us at ease in unfamiliar surroundings. hell, i\\'ve convinced myself. i\\'m gonna see it again! don\\'t expect much from this film. in many ways this film resembles a film that doris day starred in in 1956,title, julie. in this film doris,who was a flight attendant,stewardess,in those days,landed the air craft after her derange husband,played by louis jordan shot the captain. she did a far better job,more convincing,than kim ojah,who took control of a 747 and manage to land it without much help from the control tower. i know a little about 747 aircraft,i use to be a flight attendant myself. like i said,do not expect much from this film,it was done on a cheap budget. the producers were to cheap to use a plane with the name of a airline on it. oceanic is one name that several movies have used. the only writing on this plane was the name of the company that made the aircraft. prom night (2008) directed by: nelson mccormick starring: brittany snow, scott porter, jessica stroup, and dana davis plot: three years ago, donna (brittany snow) witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher (jonathan schaech) who has a bit of a crush on her. now, she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friends. once there, they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn donna because apparently her prom is too important to interrupt. pros: i got a few good laughs out of the film due to the terrible dialog and the dumb character moves. an example: everyone decides not to tell donna that the man who is oddly obsessed with her (she doesn\\'t seem that great) has escaped from prison. their reason: they don\\'t want to embarrass her in front of all her friends. lol cons: let me start off by saying i\\'m a huge slasher fan. usually i can have fun with even the bad ones. i even like some pg-13 horror films. tourist trap (1979), one of my favorites, was originally rated pg. i also enjoy poltergeist (1982) and the grudge (2004). so the fact that this is a dumb slasher film that is rated pg-13 does not have anything to do with me not enjoying the movie. first of all, i had a big problem with the story. i like slasher films that don\\'t even have stories. at least they can be entertaining. this is about a teacher who falls in love with his student, so he kills her entire family. a few years later, he tries to make it up to her by ruining her prom and killing all of her friends ...? then there were subplots that i doubt anyone cared about. claire (jessica stroup) is fighting with her boyfriend, she has cramps, and i couldn\\'t care less. this should have been a lifetime feature, not a remake of prom night. and then ... this is a slasher film with terrible death scenes. i don\\'t even care that it\\'s not that gory, some of my favorite slashers (halloween, curtains, the original prom night) were not that gory but they still had effective murders. here, we have half the characters dying in the same hotel room off screen, a woman being stabbed several times with no stab wounds, and a closeup on a bad actor\\'s face as he screams in agony. i\\'m sure that 10 year-old girls were terrified, but not me. i also hated the characters. there was donna\\'s unrealistically sensitive boyfriend bobby (scott porter) and i can almost guarantee you will never meet a boyfriend that sensitive in your life, unless you are a gay male. then we had donna\\'s annoying friends claire (stroup) and lisa (dana davis), and the token mean girl chrissy (brianne davis). if you thought the characters in death proof were annoying, try watching this movie. and don\\'t get me started on ronnie (collins pennie) and the dj (jay phillips) who gave me flashbacks to usher\\'s performance in she\\'s all that. add to all that predictable plot turns, a terrible soundtrack and a big lack of respect to the original material, and you have quite a stinker. the is one of the worst spoofs i have ever seen. for one main reason: it isn\\'t funny! i laughed a handful of times. the acting is bad, the script is worse. and why those guys had baby pacfiers in their hair i will never know. and you can tell this didn\\'t have much of a budget to work with and it openly hurts the film. they had a good idea going in some parts but it never really came to past. and what was the point about the lead being older than his dad? 3 out of 10 a convict serving time comes forward to give the cold case unit information about the murder of a policeman, committed years before. the murder of sean cooper, a good cop, was never solved. naturally, the detectives believe the new evidence will help them put together all the pieces of the puzzle that frustrated their colleagues. in flashbacks we are taken to the baptism of james bruno\\'s baby. sean and jimmy were partners. there is tension as sean, who is the godfather, arrives disheveled and late for the rite. eileen bruno doesn\\'t appear to be happy being there. the real mystery is revealed by her. she caught sean, who was drinking with jimmy in the backyard, kiss her husband, and more shocking yet, jimmy responding willingly. somehow at the station the partners become the center of gossip. sean has not endeared himself to his superior because he discovered the involvement with a criminal in his area who controlled the drug business. sean realizes this man is in with the drug strong man because he always makes an excuse to free the scum bags sean and jimmy haul into the station all the time. the pressure is too much on jimmy. sean is comfortable in his homosexuality and wants to be honest about it. cooper\\'s own father doesn\\'t want anything to do with a queer son. even his superior mccree wants him out of his jurisdiction, but the case is complicated because cooper comes from a long line of irish men serving in the police force. sean is killed because his homosexual condition, and for knowing too much on his peers\\' involvement in taking dirty money. tom petit wrote this honest portrayal of the life of a police officer in the closet and his secret love with another fellow cop. we thought it was a frank account of a serious matter no one talked about in those days. sometimes the people involved with the show, fearing reprisals from sponsors, or the networks, don\\'t dare to present these real situations. jeannot szwarc, shows a sensitive approach to this thorny issue, which is dealt without the sensationalism the case might have been shown with a different team. there is a rare chad everett appearance as the older jimmy bruno. his take is right on target with a touch of sentimentality that doesn\\'t get out of hand. shane johnson makes an excellent contribution to the show as sean cooper. the cast is marvelous and it includes good all around performances from everyone under mr. szwarc\\'s direction. in this episode, nick vera, gets closer to his neighbor, the mother of the basketball player the detective took his ball away. nick is heading for romance with the woman! ayone who whines about how this movie was crap or that it had no plot must have been looking for \"jean de florrette\". hello! this film was made to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot in any way shape or form. i would also like to remind these whiners that if you are going to flay the crap out of this film that they seem to be missing the point. this film is clearly made for people who don\\'t appreciate the so called \"american humour\" which seems to me just a pile of smutty crap. the point is everyone has an opinion and you should be a bit more appreciative that some peoples sense of humour may not be in line with your own before shooting your mouth off. thankyou sex,drugs,rock & roll is without a doubt the worst product of western civilization. the monologues are both uninteresting and pointless in the rare monologue that captures the audience\\'s attention it is quickly lost through overly long repetition and unnecessary additions (the hells angels at mcdonalds comes to mind) i guess bogosian\\'s one man show needed some filler material to give a length that he thought justified the price of admission. i would rather sleep with my aunt and be hung upside down and drained of my blood than see sex,drugs,rock & roll again. 36. the hospital (comedy, 1971) a series of emergencies has gripped manhattan hospital. patients are dying left and right due to overcrowded conditions, and a ineptitude staff. when a resident doctor is caught up in the death count the chief medical examiner, dr. bock (george c. scott), is called in to investigate. having worked as a doctor for too many years, and going through a mid-life crisis of his own, dr. bock finds the going tough. he decides to commit suicide. but then he meets barbara (diana rigg), a young-hippie beauty. whose keen insights on life help the depressed bock. critique: black comedy features a \\'tour-de-force\\' performance from veteran actor george c. scott. he\\'s good at playing high-strung, serious characters whose strict morals are severely tested. first half of the film unfolds like a melodrama, giving a pretty good account of hospital life, and the shambles they sometimes are. but then, as things look set for a dramatic climax it skews into slapstick comedy. if paddy chayefsky\\'s script had maintained its dramatic feel i wonder if scott would\\'ve walked out with another best actor oscar (he had previously won it, \\'in-absentia\\', the year before). his breakdown (suicide) scene is one of the most gut-wrenchingly real in cinema history. quote: dr. bock: \". . .last night i sat in my hotel room reviewing the shambles of my life and contemplating suicide. i said \\'no bock don\\'t do it. you\\'re a doctor, a healer, you\\'re a necessary person, you\\'re life is meaningful\\'. then. . .i find out that one of my doctors was killed by a couple of nurses. . .how am i to sustain my feeling of meaningfulness in the face of this?\" our story: two u.s. navy deep sea divers search for silver coins hidden beneath the ocean off the filipino coast. our proof: extremely dull entertainment at its best, with no plot in sight. jim brown is completely wasted, provided his help in producing this 70s war turkey. richard jaeckel is in his usual form. don cornelius and richard pryor are among those who gave special thanks in their contributions! bombs away!!! definitely a movie for people who ask only to be entertained and who do not over-think their movies. lots of action, lots of great dialogue (e.g. fun to quote), a little intrigue, and stuff blowing up all over the place. samuel l jackson and geena davis had great chemistry. violent, but not gory. the fact that the female part was the competent action lead is a pleasant turn-about. have seen the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoy it enough to put it back in my favorite films rotation every 3 or 4 months. i initially rented the movie because samuel l jackson was in the film, but was caught up in the events surrounding samantha\\'s quest to regain her memory and have never looked back. all you cerebral folks out there -- suspend disbelief for once, take yourself a little less seriously -- you might actually enjoy yourselves! about your terrible movie copying beethoven. as a professional musician it\\'s my duty to watch every movie made about any composer and beethoven is one of my favorites. when hungarians and americans meet, it\\'s a terrible combination of empty over the top emotions combined with the worst taste possible. you proved it in your terrible b-movie. the only thing that carries the movie is the music. of course you didn\\'t bother to look further than the good but in my taste contrived performances of the tackacs quartet, but ok i have to admit that the performances at least have quality as contrast to the movie you\\'ve made. it starts of with the dying deaf beethoven who perfectly understands anna who is merely whispering. beethoven\\'s hearing during the movie get\\'s better by the minute, but that must be because of some vague divine thing. then there is the quite impossible semi-pornographic \"eyes wide shut\" double-conducting scene which is totally over the top with the luscious anna and the crying nephew in the end (who also cries in the deleted scenes with constant red eyes, my god what a performance). and as culmination the rip-off from amadeus, with beethoven dictating music to anna not in notes but in total nonsense, which she understands perfectly but no-one else in your audience even trained professional musicians will understand. of course your reaction will be that negative response is a response at least, but i can assure you that beethoven himself is turning in his grave because of your worthless creation and with reason. this so called homage is blasphemy and i am so sorry to have rented one of the worst movies ever made even though it\\'s about my favorite subject. ed harris and others, you cannot comprehend the greatness of beethoven in your wildest dreams and certainly not after a couple of lessons in conducting and violin playing. that\\'s the trouble with you americans: you think you can grasp everything even when it takes a lifetime of hard work. yeah we can do it anyway! remember that a good product comes with hard labor, talent, devotion and professionalism. all these you creators of copying beethoven lack. see you in kindergarten. samuel fuller is hardly one of america\\'s great directors. i\\'m not sure he qualifies as one of hollywood\\'s great craftsmen. but he certainly ranks up there with the best of hollywood\\'s true professionals who were willing to march to their own music. during the time he worked for hollywood studios, he knew how to take an assignment, shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its parts...on time and on budget. pickup on south street is a case in point. on the surface it\\'s one more of hollywood\\'s early fifties\\' anti-commie movies, complete with appeals to patriotism, a hard-boiled hero and a slimy (and copiously perspiring) bad guy. fuller turns this bag of hollywood clichã©s into a taut, exciting drama with any number of off-kilter twists. the hero, skip mccoy, is a three-time loser, a petty crook with soft fingers who doesn\\'t change his stripes until the very end. the girl in the caper, candy, has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if you\\'re so inclined. one of the most appealing characters, moe williams, is a stoolie. and in an unusual approach to hollywood\\'s battle against commies, the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears; the hero isn\\'t motivated by anything so ennobling. he just wants payback for a personal reason, and winds up becoming...at least for now...a good guy. plus, all the actors were mostly assigned to fuller by the studio. he had to make do. richard widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star, but jean peters is a surprise. she gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb, and no better than her boy friends...or her clients...want her to be. and richard kiley, who later would become a two- time tony award winning star on broadway, is convincingly slippery and cowardly. it\\'s hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us, i mean introduced to us, \"the impossible dream\" from man of la mancha, more than anything else, this tale of a pickpocket who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash, pursued by the feds and the commies, moves straight ahead with great economy. the whole enterprise, with a classic noir look, only takes 80 minutes to tell. the dialogue, with fuller as screenwriter, has that party corny, partly pungent hard-boiled pulp fiction style. \"that muffin you grifted...she\\'s okay,\" one character says to skip about candy. fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next. then fuller throws in the character of moe williams. all of a sudden the story ratchets up to a whole new level of interest, part comedy relief and part sad inevitability. the thing i like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies fuller\\'s talents and strengths. in 2 minutes and 15 seconds, starting right after the credits, fuller is able to instantly power up the movie, to establish for us what the story is about, and to show us what kind of characters -- skip and candy -- we\\'re going to be involved with. and he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot, packed subway car that we can just about feel fuller setting the hook to catch us. says glenn erickson, in my opinion one of the best of movie critics, \"in what should be an inconsequential story, sam fuller defines his peculiar view of americanism from the bottom up: stiff-necked, aggressive self-interest that when fully expressed recognizes what\\'s wrong and what\\'s right and isn\\'t afraid to fight for it. as always in his work, the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort.\" he\\'s right, and it makes for a movie still vivid after 55 years. i have to hold barney drilling my head every day; well.. i guess there must be reasons. first, i\\'m convinced that our kids are not stupids, they are just kids, but they know (my 1 and a half years old son \"selects\" what to see) what\\'s nice or disgusting. did you see the news? do you think your kids have to know the reality as it is? maybe..or maybe not; we (the adults) have the responsibility about what we want for our kids, and what to teach them. a film of drug dealers? news about massacres in middle east? of course, the kids must know there is a real life, but... they are kids; let\\'s give them some mercy. what do you want for them? if you wanna have kids trained on weapons or the best way to kill a neighbor, go ahead, impose them lethal weapon, kill bill, any manga\\'s anime, tell them santa\\'s a depraved who enters through the chimney directly to violate them. i want illusions for my son (don\\'t get me wrong, i\\'m not saying barney and friends is the best; in fact, the show have a lot of defects, i read other comments and i agree with most); maybe the happiness is made of dreams, or illusions. at least, i want to teach him to grow without fear but cautious, that learns to think and believe that everything is not serial killers or hijackers, whom they\\'re reasons to worth to grow. that, at least, he can be a little happy with his own dreams. so, parents, don\\'t underestimate your kids; they know what they want. last weekend i bought this \\'zombie movie\\' from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of \"land of the dead\". boy, was i wrong. it seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the cover-art, which is very misleading to fans of the zombie genre. we watched up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cell-phone. they actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him; but once they started driving the car, i couldn\\'t suspend my disbelief anymore. some people actually consider this a \"so bad, it\\'s good\" movie, they are liars. i didn\\'t finish the movie, but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie, which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way through. this is even worse than \"zombiez\" do not watch! i often feel like scrooge, slamming movies that others are raving about - or, i write the review to balance unwarranted raves. i found this movie almost unwatchable, and, unusual for me, was fast-forwarding not only through dull, clichã©d dialog but even dull, clichã©d musical numbers. whatever originality exists in this film -- unusual domestic setting for a musical, lots of fantasy, some animation -- is more than offset by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thought-provoking plot development. individually, june haver and dan dailey appear to be nice people, but can\\'t carry a movie as a team. neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal. they\\'re both bland. i like billy gray, but his character is pretty one-note. the best part of the film, to me, are june haver\\'s beautiful costumes and great body. recap: full moon. a creature, a huge werewolf, is on the hunt. not for flesh, not for blood (not that it seem to mind to take a bite on the way though), but for a mate. he is on the hunt for a girl. not any girl though. the girl. the girl that is pure (and also a werewolf, although she doesn\\'t know it yet). three, well check that, two cops (after the first scene) and an old bag lady is all that can stop it, or even knows that the thing killing and eating a lot of folks around full moon is a werewolf. this particular powerful werewolf, darkwolf, is closing in on the girl. if he gets her, mankind is doomed. now the cops has to find the girl, convince her not only that there is someone, a werewolf nonetheless, that wants to rape her, and perhaps kill her, but that she is a werewolf herself. and then they got to stop him... comments: this is one for the boys, the teenage boys. a lot of scenes with semi-nude girls more or less important for the plot. mostly less. well i guess you need something to fill some time because the plot is (expectedly) thin. and unfortunately there is little besides the girls to help the plot from breaking. one usually turns to two main themes. nudity. check. and then special effects. hmm... well there are some things that you might call effects. they\\'re not very special though. in fact, to be blunt, they are very bad. the movie seems to be suffering of a lack of funds. they couldn\\'t afford clothes for some of the girls ;), and the effects are cheap. some of the transformations between werewolf and human form, obviously done by computer, are really bad. you might overlook such things. but the darkwolf in itself is very crude too, and you never get to see any killings. just some mutilated corpses afterwards. and there is surprisingly little blood about, in a movie that honestly should be drenched in blood. i\\'m not sure what to say about actors and characters. most of the times they do well, but unfortunately there are lapses were the characters (or actors) just looses it. a few of these lapses could be connected with the problems mentioned above. like the poor effects, or the poor budget(?). that could explain why there is precious little shooting, even if the characters are armed like a small army and the target is in plain sight (and not moving). but hey, when you\\'re in real danger, there nothing that will save your life like a good one-liner... unfortunately that can\\'t explain moments when the cop, steve, the only one who knows how to maybe deal with the problem, the werewolf that is, runs away, when the only things he can be sure of, is that the werewolf is coming for the girl, who is just beside him now, and that he cannot let it have her. but sure, it let the makers stretch the ending a little more... but i wouldn\\'t mind seeing none of the lead actors/actresses get another try in another movie. well. to give a small conclusion: not a movie that i recommend. 3/10 i first heard about the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya from a reviewer on youtube. he literally slapped the show with a big bad rant, condemning it rubbish and confusing. curious, i decided to watch the show (once i got the order of the episodes right, thanks to those who made the lists), and i found it absolutely brilliant and enjoyable to watch. great memorable characters who are full of life and are absolutely lovable and hilarious; a unique and not over blowing plot that makes sense now that i\\'ve watched the show; and two of the best anime moments in history, in my opinion. plus the opening and ending themes are great. the anime, based on a collection of successful manga novels, follows a simple plot, once you understand it. while the show\\'s focus is on the main character, haruhi suzumiya, the point of view is from her friend kyon. kyon is a regular high school student who doesn\\'t really believe in supernatural stuff (e.g. santa clause, aliens, time travellers, ghosts, espers) but he soon ends up talking to haruhi, who is the most oddest girl in the school and would prefer to date an alien, considering all men worthless. she even joined every club in the school to find something interesting, but quit as quickly as she joined. upon \"advice\" from kyon, haruhi decides to form her own club with kyon\\'s club. setting up in the literary club room, haruhi forms the sos brigade - its mission to investigate supernatural cases (think scooby-doo minus the dog, the masked man and the mystery machine). haruhi \"recruits\" three extra members. the first is yuki nagato, a bookworm of sorts who speaks very little and spends most of her time reading and sitting. the second is mikuru asahina, a shy girl who is forced into the club by haruhi who thinks they need a cute mascot to get some things done. she is often forced into costumes by haruhi to further her cuteness. the third is itsuki koizumi, a friendly and sociable transfer student who is always smiling. while haruhi thinks her group is filled with normal people she couldn\\'t be more wrong. while kyon is as normal as you can get, the other three on the other hand are rather unique - yuki is an alien, mikuru is a time traveller from the future, and itsuki is an esper (a person who has esp). all three have come to watch over haruhi who may just have the powers of a god, and if she becomes bored, she may be able to discover her powers and create a whole new world, and kyon is involved somehow. the show is worth watching with great characters, music and some hilarious and wonderful moments. however, for parents, there is some sexual references including mikuru\\'s cleavage being exposed or touched several times, and several swear words used as well. apart from that, the show is one of the greats. well i\\'ve enjoy this movie, even though sometimes it turns too much to a stereotypical situation. i didnt understood at this time if the \"punishment park\" has exist in the past, but i think the matter isnt really here. you have to look at this movie in a different manner. it shows how much violence you can find in our world. it reminds us that we live in a world who is lead by violence and that nobody can escape from it. if anyone refuse to \"take his responsabilities\" then you will be thrown out of our society...all our history is made by wars, we should never forget this. in fact its only when we will finally accept the truth that, maybe, we will change and understand that our \"intellectual skills\" have improve. so we could use them to find others ways to resolve our problems. in 2 words this movie is a must see, maybe it will help us to accept the truth... when i first read armistead maupins story i was taken in by the human drama displayed by gabriel no one and those he cares about and loves. that being said, we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of hollywood... writer armistead maupin and director patrick stettner have truly succeeded! with just the right amount of restraint robin williams captures the fragile essence of gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel life(jess) and the world around him(donna). as we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably. the request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward. it\\'s to bad that most people will avoid this film. i only say that because the average american will probably think \"robin williams in a serious role? that didn\\'t work before!\" please give this movie a chance! robin williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people. like his movie one hour photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art. oh and before i forget, i believe bobby cannavale as jess steals every scene he is in. he has the 1940\\'s leading man looks and screen presence. it\\'s this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now!! s~ i waited until the 4th of july to write this because . . . well . . . because it just feels right to be doing it on this day. in 1924 d.w. griffith needed a hit, he had not had a big one since orphans of the storm (1921). he\\'d been working steadily since then but his movies had been smaller in scope and had failed to hit the right chord with audiences. he was planning a film about patrick henry when he was contacted by members of the daughters of the american revolution (dar) who asked if he might expand his ideas to encompass more of the american revolution. this movie is the result. by the time he had finished he had a 14 reel history lesson and there wasn\\'t a trace of patrick henry anywhere. we all know the story of the revolutionary war but griffith threw in a love story with patriot farmer nathan (neil hamilton) falling in love with tory aristocrat nancy montague (carol dempster, a leading lady for griffith for many years). complicating matters is the fact that nancy\\'s father hates nathan . . . well not just nathan, he hates all rebels. it does not help matters when, during a skirmish on the streets of lexington someone jostles nathan\\'s arm causing him to discharge his gun and accidentally wound nancy\\'s dad! paralelling the love story is the (mostly true but partially embellished) story of capt. walter butler (lionel barrymore) a renegade british officer who feels he owes allegiance to no one. with thousands of indians form the six nations on his side he hopes to crush the colonials and become monarch of his own empire. comparisons with birth of a nation (1915) are inevitable. the montague family might just as well be the cameron\\'s from the earlier film while nathan could be a part of the stoneman family. the sequence of the battle of bunker hill is staged very similarly to a scene in birth of a nation with the attacking army, in this case the redcoats, storming a trench packed with patriots. the only thing missing is henry walthall charging across no man\\'s land to stuff a flag into the muzzle of a cannon. amazingly enough the battle scenes in america seem to lack the energy of the battle scenes in birth and fail to draw the audience in. something is clearly missing. it isn\\'t scope, g.w. \"billy\" bitzer\\'s camera work is quite good. maybe what is missing is . . . dare i say it . . . sincerity? the brutality of capt. butler and his men is well underscored although much of it happens in long shot or offscreen. don\\'t expect any heads to be lopped off in closeup like we saw in intolerance (1916). in one scene butler\\'s second in command, capt. hare (louis wolhiem) gouges out the eyes of a captive colonist. we see only the beginning of the deed, for the remainder the camera focuses on hare\\'s face as he obviously has a good time doing this. lionel had been working with griffith on and off since 1912. a story goes that he approached griffith for work and d.w., knowing the reputation of his famous family, said \"i am not hiring stage actors.\" to which lionel replied \"and i am nothing of the kind, sir!\" he makes a very good and quite believable villain. louis wolhiem appeared with lionel\\'s older brother john three times; in sherlock holmes and dr. jekyll and mr. hyde (both 1920) and later in the tempest (1927). as capt. hare his wild staring eyes and disheveled hair not only mark him as a villain but make you think he is quite mad also. neil hamilton later remarked that america was his first time on horseback and \"i was scared to death.\". he hides his displeasure very well though and we can believe he was quite the equestrian by the time shooting was over. mr. griffith was very much in love with carol dempster and at one point asked her to marry him. she refused and soon left his stock company, after which her star status gradually waned. speaking of horses, one accidentally amusing moment which had to be unscripted came during the depiction of paul revere\\'s ride. he rides his horse right up on the front porch of a family to announce \"to arms! the regulars are coming!\" but as he tries to leave the horse cannot negotiate the steps backwards and stumbles spilling his rider on the ground! i am amazed griffith did not do another take. so is america a classic? yes! don\\'t wait for july 4th to see it, it is enjoyable anytime. this is a tongue in cheek movie from the very outset with a voice-over that pokes fun at everything french and then produces a rather naif but very brave hero in fanfan la tulipe. portrayed by the splendid gerard philippe, the dashing young man believes utterly in the fate curvaceous lollobrigida foretells - notably that he will marry king louis xv\\'s daughter! problem is, la lollo soon find outs she too is in love with fanfan... propelled by good sword fights, cavalcades, and other spirited action sequences the film moves at a brisk pace and with many comic moments. the direction is perhaps the weakest aspect but the film is so light and takes itself so un-seriously that i could not give those shortcomings a second thought. look out for noel roquevert, a traditional heavy in french films, trying to steal la lollo, making himself a nuisance, and feeding the script to the fortune teller that reads la lollo\\'s hand! and what a gem marcel herrand is as the megalomanous and lust-driven king louis xv! that is not all: so many beautiful women in one film makes me wish i were in france and on the set back in 1952! the film may have come out that year but its verve, cheek, superb narration, immaculate photography and the memorable gerard philippe ensure that it remains modern and a pleasure to watch. i would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren let alone to anyone who loves movies in general and swashbucklers in particular! do see it! robert wagner is the evil boss of digicron, a telecommunications company with a virus that kills people. \\'so you\\'re saying that the software virus has become a real virus that can kill people - that may be medically possible but not possible from my system\\' \\'i\\'m having to write some new virus software of my own to trap it - it may take some time\\' \\'but it\\'s not going after software, it\\'s killing people\\' watch out for the \\'i\\'m into virology\\' love moment and perhaps first ever film plot to feature death by braille keyboard hello, looking for a movie for the family to watch on a friday night? can\\'t find what your looking for? i thought this was an extremely enjoyable movie. good for the whole family. i found that it had a remarkably rare combination of it being appealing to both adults and children alike. it was brilliant, to say the least. bruce willis\\'s acting was top-notch, there was a lot of humor in it and overall, a great movie. in my opinion, it\\'s a must-see movie. and i don\\'t think that about a lot of movies, believe me when i say it takes a lot for a movie to get me to think that. it\\'s clear that there was much work done by bruce willis and cast to get this movie done. excellent story, good acting, and again, overall a thoroughly enjoyable movie. an amazing piece of film that was well-conceived and kept me on the edge of my seat. brilliantly orchestrated in its timing, and the comedy kicked in exactly when the tension needed a release. the acting was generally well-done (the \"director\" should\\'ve asked alec guinness for acting lessons), and the shot selections were impressive (as in elongating the hall as billy tries to race to the door in the studio). this movie didn\\'t let up since the opening scene... damien o\\'donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into schmalz. this is a fantastic film, its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently. tell everyone you know to go see it now- fantastic! the acting is excellent, and dublin plays a starring role. this film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema. i can\\'t wait til it comes out on dvd. really, truly, abysmally, garishly, awful. but actor clayton moore (the movie lone ranger) acquits himself competently as an actor. he\\'s the only one. a rare treat, for five minutes, if you want to plumb the depths of grotesquely transparent special effects, southern california as \"the moon\" (again and again and again), and acting so woodenly inept that it may be a spoof . . . except that it\\'s clear that it isn\\'t--no humor here, except unintentionally. the dialogue may be worse than any of these other aspects, and the costumes . . . well, enough said. plot? what plot? bad guy (well, head bad guy) and his henchmen, including his earthly agent called krog (listen carefully or you\\'ll suspect it\\'s a spoof on the name of mcdonald\\'s founder ray kroc)and his unbelievably inept gunsels (who, however, have handguns that never need reloading; as does commando cody, so there are numerous firefight standoffs). enjoy. as you can see, i loved the book so much i use the title for my internet alias and have for over 15 years. (okay, so it had to be spelled phonetically to fit the name character limit for the bbs at the time but what could i do?) if anyone every finds this movie, i would absolutely love to see it! janet mcteer is great in everything else i\\'ve seen of hers. i think she would have made a great prue. and it even features early clive owen - from before chancer (a great series itself). what\\'s not to love? i hope the powers that be wise up and make this available on dvd soon! with some of the true dredge they pout out, it\\'s about time well executed productions make it on the market too. is there anything that happens in this movie that is not predictable? i think not. basically the movie is clichã© after clichã© and really nothing ever comes as a surprise. it makes the movie extremely predictable and because of that the movie is also seriously lacking in tension. so for a thriller it is not tense and unpredictable enough but also as a drama it\\'s a failure. this is because the movie its story is highly unlikely. i mean, no way this could ever happen in real life, as in the same way as the events occur in this movie. so the movie has a real suspense and credibility problem. but it truly are the clichã©s that killed the movie. it was cringing stuff at times. everything is so formulaic in this movie. the predator is portrayed as a cool heartless, almost psychopath like sexual frustrated boy and the victim as a naive young woman, who acts like she didn\\'t see any of this coming. everything that happened in the movie was so obvious and all seemed to happen for a reason. such as the sequence in which the \\'predator\\' fixes the \\'victims\\' broken car. that has got to be one of the oldest clichã©s out of the book. i knew what the movie tried to achieve after that point. i tried to look as if the teacher and the student were really growing toward each other trough the eyes of the other persons around them. it was so incredibly obvious and cheap that i almost wanted to stop watching the movie after that point. the movie is filled with moments like these. the title might suggest that this is a cheap porn movie but this in fact is a sappy made for tv movie. which means that everything is slowly happening and the movie spends halve its time on character development and unnecessary sub-plots to make the movie even more drama like. i\\'ll admit that elizabeth berkley is pretty good acting in this movie. she makes some of the clichã©s and events look even almost realistic at times. her hollywood career is as good as over after appearing in the paul verhoeven movie \"showgirls\", so unfortunately she will probably only still appear in movies- and television series like this one. it\\'s a waste of her talent and she surely deserves better. all of the other characters are a disappointment. corey sevier plays the clichã© pretty \\'untouchable\\' rich boy and the way the husband of the main character is portrayed is even worse. he looks more like a sexual frustrated predator than the true predator of the movie. he basically tries to have sex with his wife in every sequence. he wakes up, he wants sex. before he goes to sleep, he wants sex. he gets home, he wants sex. it might be a realistic thing but i don\\'t know, it just didn\\'t feel right for a movie like this one and the story in general. a clichã© filled movie and i can\\'t think of any reason why anyone should ever watch this movie. it\\'s predictable and therefor also lacks in suspense and credibility. not an \\'horrible\\' movie and it certainly is a watchable one at times but all the weak and clichã© elements in the movie also make this far from a recommendable one. 4/10 i was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews i saw on the web, i thought cinderella 2 (as well as 3) is a very cute and funny sequel for everyone - kids and adults...like me, i am 22 years old. i also find it and very informative film, it shows lessons on being true to yourself and following your heart. i thought it has great animation, and the voice casting was very good; the songs performed by brooke allison too. since this film has been divided into three flashbacks/stories, my favorite out of the three, is the story of when jaq the mouse, became a human for a day, thanks to fairy godmother and her magic. i found this movie to be extremely delightful.i am biased i suppose.i happen to adore kathy bates.i found her singing an added pleasure.she has a very nice voice. ms bates plays grace beasley.the film takes you from her doledrums married life in chicago to england,the home of her recently murdered singing idol victor fox.there she meets his three surviving uppity sisters.she also discovers that victor leaves behind a male lover,dirk simpson. the story leads you on to some surprisingly comedic and heartwarming situations as grace and dirk develop a true fondness for each other,after an initial rather rude rejection,on his part.they return to chicago where they team up with grace\\'s pint-sized,hilarious daughter-in-law,maudie,to find the serial killer who murdered victor. everyone in the picture did a fine job.particularly enjoyed julie andrews,lynn redgrave and barry manilow.this movie was fun.it makes you cry.the music is absolutely charming. other posters here who found problems with any parts of this movie,just don\\'t have a clue. quirky, independent, theatrical, christian slater--these are all teasers that made me look forward to spending an hour or so \"discovering\" a jewel of a film. boy, was i disappointed. julian po never gets over itself. the film is relentlessly self-conscious. i found myself unable to suspend disbelief for even a moment. the overdone, obviously theatrical sets, the overdone, obviously theatrical acting, the overdone, obviously theatrical directing -- well, you get the idea. allegories do not need to be delivered sledge hammer style. and it\\'s hard to feel much of anything for julian po because we never know much about him. the ridiculous girlfriend, the annoying townsfolk, the idiotic clergyman, the bratty kids -- why would anyone, particularly anyone with a life long ambition to get to the seaside (slater\\'s character), decide to stay in such a dismal place? zoey 101 is basically about a girl named zoey who transfers into an all boys boarding school during the first year that they integrate girls into it. that raw plot line is, i\\'ll admit, a pretty good idea. although this show was meant for children, a five year old could probably point out its fatal flaws. first, zoey is a clichã© character, her being super popular, super attractive, super smart, and there;s nothing wrong with her; no girl is like that. it feels like the show was put the spotlight on jamie lynn spears and increase her fame. dana, who appeared at the beginning of the first season, is just plain mean. however, in my opinion, she was probably the most realistic character of them all, which is sad seeing that dana is never nice. nicole is too peppy and acts like a complete airhead, but mysteriously gets straight a\\'s. lola seems to be able to fool anything with her emmy-deserving acting skills. quinn is supposed to be super smart, and although she is able to create the most unrealistic things, she is also made out to be weird, and she never gets any guys although she is both beautiful and smart, while zoey, lola, and nicole get guys and they\\'re all beauty and no personality. chase and michael are very similar, and i even sometimes get them confused. logan is unrealistically rich, and hands out millions like they\\'re dollars. nobody\\'s that rich. i\\'ve also noticed that every character on the show is mean to that stacy girl, who does nothing but act nice to them. that\\'s not funny! that\\'s mean and it just influences young girls to act mean to totally nice people. finally, the school itself adds the frosting to the unreal cake by providing the students with 5-star amenities such as a scenic location, sushi bar, hot lounge equipped with free soda machines, pool&jacuzzi, movie theater, and the allowance for boys and girls to freely go into the other sex\\'s dorm rooms. at most boarding schools, if a boy were to go into a girl\\'s dorm or vice versa they would be expelled. in conclusion, zoey 101 was poorly written and should have spent a few more years in the drafting process. this movie is terrible, it was so difficult to believe that katie became a heartfelt teenager with the power to save the pity chinese people, the movie didn\\'t show any convincing argument to prove that. and the rest of the plot didn\\'t make any effort to show us more than a cheap common sense... the plot is ridiculous and the only thing we can extract from it is that it demonstrate how arrogant a human can be. katie must have inherited her arrogance from her mother, the most annoying character i have seen for a long time. the acting and scenery were ok, but the plot ruins everything, full of cheap clichã©s and hypocritical scenes, i expect not to see this movie again in my life. skip this one! the only thing serious about this movie is the humor. well worth the rental price. i\\'ll bet you watch it twice. it\\'s obvious that sutherland enjoyed his role. 2005 was one of the best year for movies. we had so many wonderful movies, like batman begins, sin city, corpse bride, a history of violence.....coming up we also got brokeback mountain, king kong....but if this year the only great movie that came out was everything is illuminated, then we wouldn\\'t miss all this year has brought. the first movie as a director of the talented liev schreiber is a delightful, heart-warming, touching drama that also brings one of elijah wood\\'s best roles. he is perfect as jonathan, a curious man that heads for ukraine to find the woman who saved his grandfather in world war ii. liev schreiber, who also writes the movie, conducts a masterpiece, with memorable scenes and (a lot of) funny quotes. this here is a genuine mixture of comedy with drama, bringing a movie that will be commented years from now. a serious oscar contender, everything is illuminated is a powerful, original, and, why not say, illuminated movie. but there\\'s one thing you should remember while entering the movie: leave normal behind. this is special.------9/10 according to john ford\\'s lyrically shot, fictional biopic of abraham lincoln\\'s life his greatest faults may have been an obtuseness with woman and an ability to dance in \"the worst way.\" ford\\'s camera has only praising views to reveal of mr. lincoln\\'s early life. but for what the film lacks in character complexities it makes up for in beauty and depth of vision. uncharacteristically beautiful compositions of early film, what could have been a series of gorgeous still frames, ford has a unique eye for telling a story. the film sings of the life of a hopeful young man. henry fonda plays the contemplative and spontaneously clever lincoln to a tee, one of his best roles. the film concerns two young men, brothers, on trial for a murder that both claim to have committed. in classic angry mob style, the town decides to take justice into their own hands and lynch the pair of them, until honest abe steps into the fray. he charms them with his humor, telling them not to rob him of his first big case, and that they are as good as lynched with him as the boys lawyer. what follows seems to become the outline for all courtroom- murder-dramas thereafter, as abe cunningly interrogates witnesses to the delight and humor of the judge, jury and town before he stumbles upon the missing links. the film plays out like many john ford movies do: a tablespoon of americana, a dash of moderate predictability, a hint of sarcasm that you aren\\'t sure if you put in the recipe or if ford did it himself. despite the overtly \\'hollywood\\' feel of the film, and overly patriotic banter alluding to lincoln\\'s future presidency, the film is entirely enjoyable and enjoyably well constructed, if you can take your drama with a grain of salt. where to start... if this movie had been a dark comedy, i would say it was fannn-tastic! unfortunately for me, and anyone else with free time and a buck to spare (mind you that was the price i paid, got it from wal-mart), this movie was meant to be a thriller. the only thrill i got was watching kirkland\\'s lousy rendition of anne wilkes from misery sans snowy woodland area. if you want a good laugh, on a rainy friday night with some friends, then i highly recommend this movie. but if you want to watch something at least half way decent, then don\\'t even bother. i for one enjoy crappy films, the worse the better in most cases. but wow... i meant wow!! the only person in the entire film that didn\\'t stink it up was the little boy, played by vincent berry. the only reason why i even give it 3 stars is because it gave me something to do. oh dear god. this was horrible. there is bad, then there was this. this movie makes no sense at all. it runs all over the map and isn\\'t clear about what its saying at all. the music seemed like it was trying to be like batman. the fact that \\'edison\\' isn\\'t a real city, takes away. since i live in vancouver, watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable. why didn\\'t they make it a real city? the only writing that was decent was\\'tilman\\' in which john heard did a fantastic job. he was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy. it was actually a shame to see john heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time, and the movie be a washout. too bad. hopefully someone important will see it, and at least give john heard credit where credit is due, and hire him as lead bad guy again, which is where he should be. on the a list. yes, bad acting isn\\'t only one thing to mention. bad script,not so bad music. unfortunately. nice girl and nice boy with perfect bodies and super teeth just isn\\'t enough for me and for you too. first thing in the morning after crash they go to swim to the sea, to have some fun !!! smiling ... they find everything in the sea. i mean things like fishing-net, knife, scuba dive things, ropes, bottles, husband ... woodoo stuff , are you kidding. stupid. they are so happy on the island, they are going to die, and they are happy. love, peace. love. just stupid. terrible, skip this one please. i don\\'t think that many films (especially comedies) have added memorable, quotable dialog like moonstruck. i won\\'t illustrate it - you can see a remarkably long list of quotes on this thread - but any film that can make subjects like the defense of using expensive copper piping rather than brass for plumbing purposes into memorable dialog is amazing to me. it is not the only line that pops up and makes an imprint on our memory. how about a restaurant waiter who regrets a planned marriage proposal because it will mean the loss of an old bachelor client? or a nice, elderly dog fancier encouraging his pack to howl at he moon? or perry (john mahoney\\'s) description of a female student\\'s youthful promise as \"moonlight in a martini\" (my favorite line). moonstruck is a wonderful example of brilliant script, first rate direction, and a good ensemble cast that fits perfectly. there are other examples (the drama the ox-bow incident is another example, but a grimmer one). cher, olympia dukakis, vincent gardenia, nicholas cage, john mahoney, and danny aiello are all involved in plots and cross purposes that examine the nature of love, and how to handle it. is it a good thing to be totally in love? cher and cage, at the end, seem to think so, but dukakis knows that real love drives the individual crazy (and cage gets a glimmer of realization of this too, when he and cher argue outside his home after they return from the opera la boheme). is infidelity by men a way of avoiding thoughts of death. dukakis believes so, and (oddly enough - although he is not totally convinced) aiello. chance reveals infidelity - dukakis realizes early that gardenia\\'s odd behavior is tied to unfaithfulness, and cher literally stumbles onto gardenia and his girlfriend at the opera (but gardenia also stumbles onto cher\\'s similar unfaithfulness to aiello). but chance also causes misunderstandings: fyodor chaliapin stumbles on dukakis walking with john mahoney and thinks that she is having an affair. there are lovely little moments in the film too. cher\\'s observation about flowers leading to receiving one. her hearing the argument in the liquor shop and it\\'s resolution. but best is the sequence of louis guss and julie bovasso as cher\\'s uncle and aunt raymond and rita cappomaggi and rita\\'s charming and kind comment to raymond about the effect of the moonlight on him. it is the sweetest moment of the entire film. it is close to a flawless film. after seeing it over a dozen times in as many years i can only find two points that do not seem as smooth as they should be. when cher is at cage\\'s bakery, his assistant chrissy (nada despotovich) mentions how she is secretly in love with cage, but has been afraid to tell him. earlier she was slightly snippy towards cher, who put her in her place quickly. yet nothing seems done with this potential rivalry. at the same time, the fact that cher forgets to deposit her uncle and aunt\\'s daily business profits is brought in momentarily in the concluding seven minutes of the film - but just as quickly dropped. was there supposed to be some plot lines that were dropped, besides one about cher and vincent gardenia working at a homeless man\\'s shelter as penance? it is a small annoyance, but i think it is just based on a desire to see more of this film because it is so very good. one has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film a script existed that made any sense. was the rough cut 3 hours long and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives? why would anyone finance this mess? i will say that tom wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he can with the dialogue and dramatic (?) situations he is given. but characters come and go for no apparent reason, continuity is non-existent, and the acting, cinematography, and direction are (to put it politely) amateurish. not one sleeps is an unfortunate choice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyone actually attempt to actually watch this film. this time around, blackadder is no longer royal(or even particularly close to being any such thing)... instead, rather a butler to the prince regent, portrayed by hugh laurie(who replaces tim mcinnerny, who presence is sorely missed, and that hole is never filled... his character had an innocent charm... while he was a bumbling and complete moron, we can\\'t help but care for him, which isn\\'t at all true of his replacement) as being intolerably daft(which he apparently was, according to the trivia page), not to mention loud-mouthed and utterly non-threatening. edmund can now do just about what he pleases, and does so. why is he so frustrated and angry(honestly, it gets depressing at times)? yes, his master is a buffoon, they always are. he doesn\\'t seem to lack money, nor is he in any danger. in the second series, the queen was mischievous and childish, and would cut off someone\\'s head - or marry them - on a whim. here there is simply never enough at stake for any of the conflict to be exciting and interesting. there is still commentary and even a little satire. too often, it seems as if they thought that the history was funny enough on its own, so they merely restate it, not bothering to actually turn the facts into jokes or gags. and i can\\'t tell you how many of them i figured out before they were done, literally more than a minute away. it\\'s not usually a positive when you know the punchline before it is delivered. baldrick doesn\\'t change from last season... he\\'s still rather pathetic and stupid, leading to \"silly\" humor. frankly, the amount goes through the roof. don\\'t get me started on the gross-out stuff. the sarcastic, verbal wit can still be great, though much less of it is than before. i\\'d say about half of the episodes were rather amusing and downright funny, while the other three didn\\'t really get me into them at all. i was disappointed in how predictable some of the plots and developments thereof were... i could see many of such coming a mile away. some of the material tries way too hard to be funny and winds up coming across as incredibly forced. this continues with the tradition started by \"ii\" of letting the plans work out occasionally. the theme is the worst of the bunch, the credits sequences the least creative. all in all, this is, by far, my least favorite of the four. i recommend it to fans of the franchise and of british comedy in general. 7/10 an awful b movie at best with video quality similar to dead alive. i challenge anyone who is a \"aliens (james cameron 1986)\" movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage. cast members such as r. lee ermey and ray wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead \"jack scalia\" was really absolutely horrible. i think they cast him for his massive cleft chin. i was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set john toles-bey who must look at this movie and just wonder. look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies. but on this movie: the script as i said earlier was a rip-off of aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine \"thriller\". it included such lines as \"i got a bad feeling about this\" and \"kill me\" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the \"alien hop\" just before it pops out of his stomach. there is also a rip-off of the classic \"get some!\" via bill paxton. we also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls. even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie \"aliens\". and the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood). there are many more major examples. so if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics alien and aliens (with sigourney weaver). you\\'ll have a more enjoyable time. the plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing. camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn\\'t very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email. many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not. the whole command structure between crew and capt. was poorly done. i\\'m not even sure if there are captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs. in general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..). if you like horrible movies or are a big fan of alien and aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you. as for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently. now this is what i\\'d call a good horror. with occult/supernatural undertones, this nice low-budget french movie caught my attention from the very first scene. this proves you don\\'t need wild fx or lots of gore to make an effective horror movie. the plot revolves around 4 cellmates in a prison, and each of these characters (and their motives) become gradually more interesting, as the movie builds up tension to the finale. most of the action we see through the eyes of carrere, who has just entered prison and has to get used to living with these 3 other inmates. i won\\'t say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen. there a few flaws though: the fx are not that good, but they\\'re used effectively; the plot leaves some mysteries open; and things get very confusing towards the end, but malefique redeems itself by the time it\\'s over. i thought his was a very good movie, 8/10 this is a voice of a person, who just finished watching the second season of rome, almost at one go, and grabbed the opportunity to see \"what happened next\" - this film conveniently takes off where rome ends. if you find rome an abomination, a foul mouthed screw-fest of little historical accuracy, then you might enjoy imperium: augustus. but, if you feel rome is a good thing, if you enjoy the complicated intrigue, the ambiance of decadence and the work of the actors, then imperium will obviously appear to you as an overly timid, superfluous and tedious soap opera with not many redeeming factors. there are some actors who for my taste look somewhat better than these in rome. i especially disliked rome\\'s image of cleopatra as a drug-soaked sex addict. there must have been a great deal of strength and dignity in that woman, and the actress in imperium suits the part much better. o\\'toole and rampling are good, and so are some others. but then... if you have come to know - and love - atia as the super cool bitch, you\\'ll find the depiction of her in imperium - as a tear-jerking mother goose in an apron - absolutely ridiculous. there are supposed to be some bitchy characters in imperium, but these actresses rely heavily upon staring at the men and nothing much more. you\\'ll find no interesting female characters in this epic. there\\'s also the painfully comic maecenas, whom we see as a screeching drag queen, even though there is little historical evidence that he was such (he\\'s once referred to as \"being effeminate in his pleasures\" in the annals). the interiors are rather meager and rely on clichã©s upon clichã©s. cleopatra\\'s big hall looks like something out of a computer game or a children\\'s play room in an egyptian theme park. there\\'s a looooooooot of really poor 3d graphics, not up to 2003 standards. the action is presented as a series of flashbacks the aged augustus is reliving. so we get a quick look at some historical events, some of which are presented well, whereas some are not. an disproportional amount of time is wasted to show livia as the \"eternal flame\" of augustus. this affair doesn\\'t sizzle for even a moment, the dialog is superlame and everything is seasoned with tacky tear-inducing musical score. whatever amount of reality the show aims to capture, every last shred of it is destroyed by the dry synchronized dubbing (most of the actors are non english speakers). everything is lukewarm in this epic. true, there are more historical accuracies than in rome, but dramatically speaking, it\\'s plain boring. the characters lack depth and the dialog sharpness. camera-work is often reduced to static shots, and lighting offers nothing to please your eye. there\\'s really no-one to love and no-one to hate in imperium. regardless of whether you liked or disliked rome, there are much better films and miniseries around. ancient rome: the rise and fall of an empire would be one thing i recommend. this review is dedicated to the late keith moon and john entwistle. the original drum and bass. there seems to be very little early who footage around these days, if there is more then lets be \\'aving it, now-a-days it tends to be of a very different kind of who altogether, a parody, a shadow of their (much) better years. to be fair, not one of them has to prove anything to anyone anymore, they\\'ve earned their respect and with overtime. this concert footage for me is one of their best. to command an audience of around a 400,000 plus strong crowed takes skill, charisma, wit and a whole lot of bloody good music. we all know of the other acts on the bill, the doors (their last ever show weeks before jim morrison died), moody blues, hendrix, taste, free and many more. the point being that whoever were there it was the who that the majority had come to see. this show was one year after the great hippie fest of the 1960\\'s; woodstock. the film and record had come out and so had the who\\'s greatest work to date, tommy. the ever hungry crowd wanted a taste, to be able to experience their own unique event, to be able to \"grove and love\" in the knowledge that this gig was their own. to do this you needed the best of what rock \\'n roll had to throw at the hungrily baited crowd. at two \\'o clock in the morning in late august 1970 the m.c. announces, \"ladies and gentlemen, a small rock \\'n roll band from shepherds bush london, the \\'oo\". john entwistle\\'s body suit is of black leather, on the front is the out line of a human skeleton from neck to toe, roger dressed in his traditional stage outfit of long tassel\\'s and long flowing hair, keith in a white t-shirt and jeans, as pete had his white boiler suit and doc martins that he\\'d preferred to wear. the who never stopped their onslaught of high energy rock for over two hours, performing theirs and other artists\\' greatest tracks such as young man blues, shaking\\' all over, and then as on queue, keith baiting the crowed to \"shut up, it\\'s a bleeding opera\" with tommy, the rock opera. the crowed went wild. this is what they had come to hear, and the who didn\\'t disappoint, straight into overture and never coming up for air until the final note of \"tommy can you hear me?\" amazing. to capture a show of this magnitude of a band of this stature at their peak at a festival that was to be the last of its kind anywhere in the world was a fantastic piece of cinematic history. the english dvd only comes in a soundtrack of english/linear pcm stereo, were as in the states, i think, you can get it with 5.1 at least, \"check local press for detailsâ…\" on that, okay. the duration of the dvd is 85 minutes with no extras, which is a disappointment. yes, for a slice of rock and festival history this dvd would send you in a nostalgia trip down memory lane the moment you press play, for some of the best who concert footage as it was meant to be, live, raw and in your face! i would have given this dvd ten if it wasn\\'t for the lack of 5.1, and some extras would have been nice. thanks roger, pete, john and keith. this film has some pretty gorey parts like a boob getting bit off and a other big bites. castle freak himself is a good monster. i would be scared to pieces if he was coming after me. however, the movie had some dumb parts about it. a husband goes drunk driving and kills his 3 year old son and blinds his teenage daughter. i suppose death is a greater damage than blindness, but you\\'d never know that the parents actually feel bad about their daughter being blind. all they care about is that \"j.j.\\'s dead!\" while their teenage daughter walks around running into things and talking about how she\\'ll never be able to drive a car. the parents are like - \"honey, stop walking around without a guide, you know better than that,\" and then they cry and don\\'t ever stop being depressed because jj\\'s dead. sounds like favortism to me. the lines of dialogue are not very realistic or well done. for example, when a giant crash is heard in the castle, everybody runs down into the basement to see what it was. it was a huge mirror that crashed to the ground and shattered. the husband runs to the broken mirror in horror and plainly says, \"the mirror broke.\" i don\\'t know, i would say a little more than that if a giant mirror mysteriously crashed to the ground in my castle. the husband and wife have some major relationship problems and it\\'s funny to watch how dumb they are with each other. no one ever believes the blind girl. advice: if a blind girl says she hears things, believe her and don\\'t tell her to shut up. i think this is the moral of the story. listen to people when they tell you things or else you might end up killing yourself to prove your point. lastly, i thought the best character was the main police officer. he was the best actor and character. everyone else (besides castle freak) was pretty run of the mill. 3/10 from the first scene, i was really excited. \"i can tell this is going to be awesome!\" i thought. the acting was so good, i felt as though i was eaves-dropping on these peoples\\' lives. the music too was exquisitely unsettling. the plot started with a sudden event and then drifted forward (one could sense) toward some irrevocable fate. the build was slow, but i personally love that kind of thing, as long as the quiet tension stays on track and doesn\\'t get derailed before it\\'s ready to pay off. so everything\\'s going fine, and then the fireworks begin, and before you know it, the credits are rolling. \"what?!!!\" was all i and my movie-night companion could say. if you understand the director\\'s intentions, the blunt ending does make sense (for those of you who have seen the movie already, check out the very fascinating and hilarious interview with larry fessenden at filmcritic.com), but i can\\'t help saying it was not pulled off quite right. this probably could have been resolved with as little as ten more minutes of material before the climax. in any case, it\\'s too bad. those ten minutes could have made all the difference in the world. (but for those of you who don\\'t write or make films, you should know that crafting a story arc with the proper timing is a huge pain in the butt, and i am certainly not making this critique from any kind of pedestal!) wendigo feels to me like a masterpiece that was given up on before it was finished. but hay, i\\'d take a blunted masterpiece any day over an over-produced piece of dog-poo over-compensated with too many digital effects (like most horror movies these days). one other comment. some of the monster scenes left me confused as to whether i should be scared or laughing. i don\\'t know how to explain it, but there was a distinctively monty python feel about this monster in his more blatent \"monster\" forms. although this may sound like a terrible criticism for a horror movie--i don\\'t know, it still worked for me in some crooked way. i will never look at deer antlers in the same way again! :) what if a platoon of g.i.\\'s from the japanese army were to be send back in time 400 years right in the middle of the feudal wars that led to the formation of the tokugawa shogunate? great pitch right? the movie does exactly what it says on the tin. thankfully the writers didn\\'t bother to explain the, usually ridiculous in sci-fi movies, scientific mumbo jumbo of time transport. no how\\'s or why\\'s. they just did. however the time transport sequence itself is trippy as hell and quite beautiful, if not a bit dated. not as silly as one would imagine. the rest of the movie follows the premise to a t. but while it loses a bit of steam with the various subplots that follow the g.i.s arrival to medieval japan, it picks up with a devastating battle sequence. undoubtedly it\\'s the main order of the day. the whole concept and by extension the movie itself, was probably originated from this simple pitch: what if g.i.\\'s equipped with the latest in modern warfare were to fight samurais? and boy does it deliver. the main battle sequence that spans more than half an hour is probably one of the best of its kind in 70\\'s action/war movies. not only is it relentless and exhausting in pace and length, it\\'s also a terrific mish-mash of styles and techniques that only unique premises like g.i. samurai can deliver. i mean, where else would you get the chance to feature tanks, ninjas complete with shuriikens, a helicopter and samurais in the same shot? the g.i. platoon led by lieutenant iba tears literally through hundreds of extras, gunning them down with machine guns, mortars, grenades and tanks. this mish-mash of styles is with one foot firmly rooted in the sprawling jidai-geki epic of kurosawa\\'s kagemusha or hiroshi inagaki\\'s samurai banners, while the other is in western action and war movies. there are stylistic touches (like the wonderful slow-motion shots and bloody violence) that bring sam peckinpah or enzo g. castellari circa keoma to mind. japanese cinema has always been influenced by westerns and other hollywood works and vice versa, and g.i. samurai effortlessly turns this east-meets-west melting pot into an exciting film. the film-makers thankfully take the whole thing seriously and the movie benefits immensely from it. not that tongue-in-cheek mentality is completely absent, it\\'s just that it doesn\\'t try to pander to so-bad-it\\'s-good audiences that enjoy laughing at their movies. the budget was probably hefty, as it is evident in the hundreds of extras, elaborate costumes (very decent for a production that is not a traditional jidai-geki) and special effects. the camera-work and editing are all top notch, almost better than a movie with no higher artistic ambitions deserves. it\\'s not withouts its flaws either of course. there are many \"song\" scenes, where all sorts of 70\\'s japanese rock, disco and country songs play over montages (there\\'s a bonding scene, a love-interest scene, a \"war is hell\" scene etc). the songs themselves are pretty lame and corny and detract from the whole thing. although it clocks at a whooping 140 minutes, it flies like a bullet for the most part. still some scenes, flashbacks and subplots in the first half could have been clipped for a tighter effect. the cast also deserves a mention, featuring such prominent names as sonny chiba, isao natsuyagi (goyokin, samurai wolf), tsunehiko watase (the yakuza papers) and hiroyuki sanada, all of them hitting the right notes. manipulative drama about a glamorous model (margaux hemingway) who is raped by a geeky but unbalanced musician (chris sarandon) â€“ to whom she had been introduced by her younger sister (played by real-life sibling mariel), whose music teacher he is. while the central courtroom action holds the attention â€“ thanks largely to a commanding performance by anne bancroft as hemingwayâ€™s lawyer â€“ the film is too often merely glossy, but also dramatically unconvincing: the jury ostensibly takes the musicianâ€™s side because a) the girl invited assault due to the sensuous nature of her profession and b) she was offering no resistance to her presumed aggressor when her sister arrived at the apartment and inadvertently saw the couple in bed together. what the f***?!; she was clearly tied up â€“ what resistance could she realistically offer? the second half of the film â€“ involving sarandonâ€™s rape of the sister, which curiously anticipates irreversible (2002) by occurring in a tunnel â€“ is rather contrived: marielâ€™s character should have known better than to trust sarandon after what he did to her sister, but margaux herself foolishly reprises the line of work which had indirectly led to her humiliating experience almost immediately! the climax â€“ in which sarandon gets his just desserts, with margaux turning suddenly into a fearless and resourceful vigilante â€“ is, however, a crowd-pleaser in the style of death wish (1974); incidentally, ubiquitous italian movie mogul dino de laurentiis was behind both films. itâ€™s worth noting how the two hemingway sistersâ€™ lives took wildly different turns (this was the film debut of both): margauxâ€™s career never took off (despite her undeniable good looks and commendable participation here) â€“ while mariel would soon receive an oscar nomination for woody allenâ€™s manhattan (1979) and, interestingly, would herself play a glamorous victim of raging violence when essaying the role of real-life â€œplayboyâ€\\x9d centerfold dorothy stratten in bob fosseâ€™s star 80 (1983). with the added pressure of a couple of failed marriages, margaux took refuge in alcohol and would eventually die of a drug overdose in 1996; chillingly, the hemingway family had a history of suicides â€“ notably the sistersâ€™ grandfather, celebrated author ernest, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1961. this all-but-ignored masterpiece is about the monkees becoming aware that they are fictional characters in a movie (head), and that everything they do or say had already been written in an (unseen) script they seem to be following. head was written by jack nicholson, rafelson, and peter tork during a three-day lsd trip in a suite at an expensive hollywood hotel. the other three monkees only acted in it. they fight this every way they can by doing things not in the script. they deliberately flub their lines, walk off sets, tear up scenery, punch other actors for no reason; and ultimately, commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. for instance, in the rapid flashes of a psychedelic party scene, if you watch frame-by-frame, you can see rafelson sitting next to the camera and cameraman, very deliberately shooting into a mirror. he is revealing that the party is actually fake and is being shot in a studio with actors who suddenly drop out of character and walk away in the middle of a conversation when the director yells \"cut!\" the monkees, however, never drop out of character because those characters are also who they really are. that ends up being the core of the revelation soon to come. at every turn, they realize their increasingly-bizarre actions were exactly what they were supposed to do in the scripted film they can\\'t escape being in. you say they went crazy and walked through the sky (which turns out to be painted on paper and hung from the ceiling as the set\\'s background)? no problem! hey, hey, they\\'re the monkees, and those wacky guys just keep monkeying around! in the end, even their deaths did not set them free. that was how the movie was supposed to end, and their motionless, waterlogged bodies are fished out of the river, put in another box, and stacked in a film studio warehouse until the characters are needed again for another studio production. this is made all the more poignant by the fact that the monkees really are fictional characters who forced themselves into the real world. they did it through the power of their music. ironically, near the end, peter tork has what he rightly sees as a hugely profound revelation that solves their problem, but unfortunately, no one listens. peter realizes: \"it doesn\\'t matter if we\\'re in the box (the film)\". he means that it doesn\\'t matter if will is free or illusory, and that \"the only important thing is that you just let the present moment occur and occur... you need to just let \\'now\\' happen, as it happens\", without analyzing or evaluating or judging whether the experience is \"valid\" by some abstract definition. when you can\\'t even tell the difference, will being free or not doesn\\'t matter--tying to figure out if you are the \"real\" you is just a pointless waste of time. i saw this film at a very important time in my life. i was trying to figure out how to escape being just \"that geeky, creepy nerd girl\" by thinking about it intensely instead of just having fun (i.e., sex) like everyone else did. but the revelation in head broke my self-imposed recursive trap and helped me more than rafelson or nicholson or tork will ever know. for decades, i\\'ve watched \"head\" and wished i could thank pete. was this a good movie? uhh, how about, like... ==< yes >== i thought the movie was a poor documentary. nothing of substance was discussed. it seemed to cheapen the ideas and did not provide anything new. the film lacked wonder or romance or anything that would really drive one to science. most scientists appeared \"stereotyped\" and sometimes weird. a woman said that her awards didn\\'t matter a whole lot, only children that were helped. she said that after a 10 minute scene where she explained all her awards. playing \"humble scientist\", are we? \"i have equations dancing in my head,\" another said. i don\\'t see how that explains anything to us. it hasn\\'t covered significant effects of science on our culture. politics of science were barely touched. not a bad flick for a 10-14 year-olds. other than that, i felt it was boring and unrevealing. 4/10 this movie is yet another in the long line of no budget, no effort, no talent movies shot on video and given a slick cover to dupe unsuspecting renters at the video store. if you want to know what watching this movie is like, grab a video camera and some red food dye and film yourself and your friends wandering around the neighborhood at night growling and \"attacking\" people. congratulations, you\\'ve just made \"hood of the living dead\"! now see if a distribution company will buy it from you. i have seen some low budget, shot on video films that displayed talent from the filmmakers and actors or at the very least effort, but this has neither. avoid unless you are a true masochist or are amused by poorly made horror movies. don\\'t bother trying to watch this terrible mini series. it is a six hour bore, an unbelievable love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other. there is no heat in this story, no real passion, no real romance. it is a dry, boring, drawn out, and uninspired as they come. and it doesn\\'t even meet the expected level of technical proficiency. take those six hours of your life and use them for something more worthwhile. there is a bit of a spoiler below, which could ruin the surprise of the one unexpected and truly funny scene in this film. there is also information about the first film in this series. i caught this film on dvd, which someone gave as a gift to my roommate. it came as a set together with the first film in the \"blind dead\" series. this movie was certainly much worse than the first, \"la noche del terror ciego\". in addition, many of the features of the first movie were changed significantly. to boot, the movie was dubbed in english (the first was subtitled), which i tend to find distracting. the concept behind the series is that in the distant past a local branch of the knights templar was involved in heinous and secret rituals. upon discovery of these crimes, the local peasantry put the templars to death in such a manner that their eyes can no longer be used, thus preventing them from returning from hell to exact their revenge. we then jump to modern times where because of some event, the templars arise from the dead to exact their revenge upon the villagers whose ancestors messed them up in the first place. of course, since the undead knights have no eyes, they can only find their victims when they make some sort of noise. the templars were a secretive order, from about the 12th century, coming out of the crusades. they were only around for about 150 years, before they were suppressed in the early 1300s by the pope and others. because they were secretive, there were always rumors about their ceremonies, particularly for initiation. also, because of the way the society was organized, you didn\\'t necessarily have church officials overseeing things, which meant they didn\\'t have an inside man when things heated up. and, because of the nature of their trials, they were tortured into confessions. the order was strongest in france, but did exist in portugal and spain, where the movies take place. where the first movie had a virgin sacrifice and knights drinking the blood directly from the body of the virgin (breast shots here, of course, this is a horror film after all), and then, once the knights come back to life, they attack their victims by eating them alive and sucking their blood; in this sequel, this all disappears. you still have the same scene (redone, not the same footage) of them sacrificing the virgin, but they drain the blood into a bowl and drink it from that. thus, when they come back, they just hack people up with their swords or claw people to death, which i have to say is a much less effective means of disturbing your audience. there\\'s also a time problem: in the first film the dating is much closer to the templars, where here they are now saying it is the 500 anniversary of the peasants burning these guys at the stake, which would date it around 1473. and the way that the templars lose their eyes is much less interesting as well. in the first, they have them pecked out by crows. now they are simply burned out, and in quite a ridiculous manner. oh yeah, and maybe it was just me, but there seemed to be a lot of people from the first movie reappearing in this film (despite having died). not really a problem, since the movie is completely different and not a sequel in the sense of a continuation, but odd none-the-less. the highlight of this movie is the rich fellow who uses a child to distract the undead while he makes a break for the jeep. the child\\'s father had already been suckered by this rich man into making an attempt to get the jeep, so he walks out and tells her to find her father. it comes somewhat out of the blue, and is easily the funniest scene in the film. of course, why the child doesn\\'t die at this point is beyond me, and disappointed for horror fans. i couldn\\'t possibly recommend this film to anyone. it isn\\'t so bad that it becomes funny, so it just ends up being a mediocre horror film. the bulk of the film has several people holed up in a church, each making various attempts to go it alone in order to escape the blind dead who have them surrounded. when the film ends, you are not surprised at the outcome at all; in fact, quite disappointed. if you are into the novelty of seeing a spanish horror film, see the first movie, which at least has some innovative ideas and not so expected outcomes. the film had many fundamental values of family and love. it expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story. the script was clear( it was very easy to understand making it perfect for children)and was enjoyable and humorous at times. there were a few charged symbols to look for. the cinematography was acceptable. there was no sense of experimentation that a lot of cinematographers have been doing today(which quiet frankly is getting a little warn out). it was plainly filmed but had a nice soft quality to it. although editing could have been done better i thought it was a nice movie for a family to enjoy. and the organization of information was just thrown at you which was something i didn\\'t like either but in all it was a good movie. an ear-splitting movie, a quasi-old-fashioned screwball romp designed to showcase singing star madonna\\'s comedic attributes. she does indeed go far out on the proverbial limb here playing a beyond-vivacious parolee attempting to prove she was framed for murder (a body was found in the trunk of her car after she ran a red light...big laughs). after an energetic animated credits sequence--which is much more fun than the rest of the picture--we have nothing to look at but madonna\\'s black mascara and red lips set off by her platinum hair and pale complexion. what else is there? griffin dunne seems defeated playing maddy\\'s keeper, while the poor-choice supporting cast struggles to get laughs with lousy dialogue. it\\'s an unfortunate set-back to the talents of director james foley, who unwisely allows his star to run rampant in the spirit of the nutty slapstick films from the 1930s (but even katharine hepburn in \"bringing up baby\" had a human side). wretched. * from **** a murder investigation goes on back stage while the vanities, on its opening night, plays on to an unknowing audience. odd combination of musical and murder mystery is worth a look for its cast, its production numbers, and the sheer novelty of the film. gertrude michael has the showy role of a bitchy actress intent on stopping the marriage between the show\\'s stars, kitty carlisle and carl brisson, as well as starring in the infamous \"sweet marijuana\" number (which was also on a 70s bette midler album). so while the chorus girls shuffle around backstage, bumbling detective victor mclaglen ogles the girls while he tries to solve the backstage murder of an unknown woman. we quickly learn that the maid (dorothy stickney) loves brisson from afar, that the wardrobe lady (jessie ralph) is brisson\\'s mother, and that the stage manager (jack oakie) butts into everything. lots of plots twists among the musical numbers. the show\\'s best-known song is \"cocktails for two.\" kitty carlisle also sings the haunting \"where do they come from?\" and there\\'s a weird rhapsody that erupts into a harlem specialty number featuring duke ellington! quite the cast. some terrific acting here, especially gertrude michael and dorothy stickney. kitty carlisle is quite good as well. brisson is a total zero though. charles middleton plays homer, toby wing plays nancy, donald meek plays the doctor, and also see if you can spot ann sheridan and lucille ball among the show girls. daft potboilers don\\'t come much dafter than this, but it\\'s a douglas sirk movie which makes everything alright. except in this case it doesn\\'t. based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious lloyd c douglas, (he wrote \"the robe\"), and already filmed in 1935 with irene dunne and robert taylor, it\\'s got more uplift than a cantilever bra. rock hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making jane wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight. to make amends he takes up medicine, becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it. (no, it sin\\'t quite that daft; he had planned to become a doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy). in between times, they fall in love. try as i might i can\\'t quite find the redeeming social commentary and critique of american mores that are supposed to lie just below the surface of sirk\\'s films, (this one isn\\'t too deep). on the plus side rock hudson isn\\'t half bad, (i think i am rediscovering him), and, of course, it looks great, (in sirk\\'s films people live in rooms the size of cathedrals). nothing in this film matches the best of his later work and even in soap-opera terms this is definitely daytime tv. if you don\\'t mind having your emotions toyed with, then you won\\'t mind this movie. on the other hand, if you enjoy british crime mysteries, following clues and seeing how they all logically fall into place at the end, you\\'ll be very disappointed. here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to that disappointment: * while the police utilize the cctv cameras early on to gather clues about the mystery, the huge truck that stopped and blocked the children\\'s view just before her disappearance doesn\\'t get caught on camera. this is a critical piece of the mystery. it\\'s inconsistent to have the car the children were in caught on camera and not the big truck that is so critical to the mystery. * the movie goes to great lengths to show the sophistication of the equipment in tracking down the children\\'s movements but misses the opportunity to utilize the same sophisticated equipment is tracking down vehicles that may have entered the crime scene from camera-visible locations adjacent to the crime scene as part of developing clues. * in england, driving is on the left. the director goes out of his way to have the car at the crime scene park on the right, several meters away from the flower kiosk, when it could have easily parked immediately behind, or even on the side; as the huge truck did. * the police forensics team is so meticulous as to find a discarded cell phone in a sewer drain several miles from the scene of the crime, but can\\'t find any blood evidence from the head injury right at the crime scene, even though they secured the scene just hours after the disappearance and with no intervening rainfall. * search dogs were not used at all to find the missing children; this from the country that is well known for developing the hound dog for search and hunting. * it is illogical that such a highly publicized news story would not turn up the presumably innocent truck driver that stopped at the flower kiosk. * it is illogical that the mother would go to such extremes and expend so much effort to leave carpet fiber clues under her fingernails for her eventual murder investigators â–even coaxing her daughter to do the same-- while she simply could not have crawled out of the unguarded mobile home. if she had enough sense about her to ask her daughter to get carpet fibers under her nails, she could of just as easily asked her daughter to call out for help or even leave the mobile home that was in a crowded residential park. * the suspect that abducted the little girl was portrayed as mentally slow/dimwitted --justifying his unknowingly drowning of the motherâ— but, he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and also fully exercise his rights not to self-incriminate. there are more inconsistencies like this that will lead to a true sleuth aficionado\\'s disappointment. \\'five days\\' is a very weak british crime story. what is this!! its so bad. the animation looks so terrible , it looks like a ps1 type game. the actors are awful, they just cannot act to save their lives. i sat through all of this film an then at the end i was annoyed when i realised i had wasted 3 hours of my life. i\\'ve not heard of this film, did it ever actually come out in the cinema or did it go straight to dvd? a girl got shot?! what is up with that, it was just a stupid film. they totally copied \\'the day after tomorrow\\'. its got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen. i would definitely recommend to people to not waste their time with this. you could spend your time watching \\'the day after tomorrow\\', its a lot better. well thats what i think of the film. actually why have i wasted my time writing about it, ah dam!! its really annoying me, its wasted 3 hours and 10 minutes now. redundant, but again the case. if you enjoy the former snl comedian and his antics (in this case, schneider), then you should go. basic comedyâ….man\\'s life is saved by having various animal organs transplanted into him. unfortunately, he takes on each animal\\'s characteristics. former survivor colleen looks pretty good here, now that she doesn\\'t have open sores on her legs, and a little makeup on her face! d for only doing a few movies with his life the late great chris farley. farley died at the end of 1997 and will be missed mostly by his co actor in tommy boy, david spade. from the lame police academy 4 spade really has done good with his career in films. tommy boy is a classic and we will always remember chris farley when we watch it. from appearing on saturday night live to doing tommy boy, black sheep, beverley hills ninja, almost heroes, billy madison, and dirty work. i think chris farley had a short and successful career. tommy boy was his best in my case and i would watch over and over again and laugh at the same part each time. thank you chris farley. tashan - the title itself explains the nature of the movie. this type of movies are actually made for flop. what a shame that yash raj films produces such movies those are worthless than c-grade movies. or even some c-grade movies have better and pleasing story than tashan. the much hyped and over-confidently promoted tashan poorly bombed at the box-office which it certainly deserved. in my view, this is the worst movie ever made from honourable yash raj films\\' banner. how come they handled such a heavy project to new vijay krishna acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick? he tried to imitate sanjay gadhvi\\'s ways of making like dhoom but he suffered at last. the action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiences. the story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences\\' hearts. in most scenes anil kapoor reminds me of southern tamil star rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions. i am not a fan of neither saif nor akshay, but the award of kareena should have finally gone to saif\\'\\'s hand instead of akshay. just from the starting point i expected of it, but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth. saif is the main behind the whole adventure, while akshay joins in the midst. in any movie, the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit. and tashan loses in this way, and unexpectedly failed to become a hit. akshay\\'s has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies. he seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again. in between saif did a great job in race, and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie. but he has fully developed himself in the acting field. and last but not the least about kareena. she looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean. but i myself don\\'t think so, instead she became slim. yes slim!!! it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people (or say, male). beside them it is nice that saif\\'s son ibrahim appears in the beginning & last as young saif. i hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his career. those who like this tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood, or say want to be admitted in an asylum. thumbs down to debutante director vijay krishna acharya who mishandled the project offered by yash raj films. in future he should experiment and study the script minimum of 5 years before going into practical directions. sorry, i don\\'t like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies. i was so happy to learn that hari om will finally be theatrically released in 2007. i saw this film three years ago at the vancouver international film festival and have been waiting for it\\'s release ever since so i could send everyone i know to see it. it\\'s like taking a trip to india....colorful, magical, thought provoking. aside from one rather strange hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic. this is not a bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor. the interactions between the indian taxi driver and the french tourist are a good reflection on the fundamental differences between eastern and western life styles and philosophy. the characters are a little broadly drawn but the acting was very good. visually this movie is a treat as you really do get a sense of what driving through rajasthan is like...dreamlike. sometimes it\\'s hard to believe everything you are seeing and experiencing is real...the movie has that same quality. great soundtrack too! i still can\\'t believe that wes craven was responsible for this piece of crap.this movie is worse than \"deadly friend\".the plot is stupid,the acting is mediocre and the film is deadly dull.i don\\'t know why wes craven hates his debut \"last house on the left\"-an absolute masterpiece of the genre and likes(probably)this turkey.don\\'t get me wrong,i really like some of his movies,but it was a real torture sitting and watching this. i had my doubts about another love story wherein disabled individuals find meaning and redemption through honest communication. and it\\'s still not at the top of my list. but the performances from helena bonham carter and kenneth branagh and exemplary, almost stunning, and rescue this from being just another tear-jerker. carter\\'s depiction of an als victim is strong, perhaps even overdone at times (sometimes her dialog dissolves into undistinguishable mutterings). but the overall effect is commendable and rewarding. branagh may be the perfect compliment to her performance. i\\'ve been a jennifer connelly fan since phenomena, and after i heard about seven minutes in heaven, i saw it as soon as i could. the movie is not only a comedy if you think a lot of these things most of us went through as kids and are currently going through not only was the movie terrific led by the phenomenal jennifer connelly it captivated my attention that this movie was terrifically written directed and acted out it was one good deal i loved it and have watched it again and again and for those of you who enjoy a good laugh or love jennifer connelly you to can not put off seeing this movie!!!! warning: does contain spoilers. open your eyes if you have not seen this film and plan on doing so, just stop reading here and take my word for it. you have to see this film. i have seen it four times so far and i still haven\\'t made up my mind as to what exactly happened in the film. that is all i am going to say because if you have not seen this film, then stop reading right now. if you are still reading then i am going to pose some questions to you and maybe if anyone has any answers you can email me and let me know what you think. i remember my grade 11 english teacher quite well. his name was mr. krisak. to me, he was wise beyond his years and he always had this circuitous way of teaching you things that perhaps you weren\\'t all too keen on. if we didn\\'t like shakespeare, then he turned the story into a modern day romance with modern day language so we could understand it. our class room was never a room, it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book at our own leisure time. this was his own indelible way of branding something into our sponge-like minds. i begin this review of vanilla sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us an assignment that has been firmly etched in my mind, like the phone number of a long lost best friend, and it finally made some sense to me after watching the matrix. now if i didn\\'t know better, i would have thought that the wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher mr. krisak. but giving them the benefit of the doubt, we\\'ll assume it wasn\\'t him. but that was the first time this assignment was anything more than impalpable. he had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that were real. show me how you can tell that you are real. this got the class spouting off all of the usual ideas that i\\'m sure you can imagine. everything from pain, to sense of touch to sense of loss to sense of hunger were spouted off to our teacher to prove to him that we were real. after every scenario that we gave him, he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechless. \"what if you are nothing but someone else\\'s dream?\" what if you were someone else\\'s dream? what a messed up question that is. this was a question/scenario posed to us about 15 years ago, before the astronomical use of the internet and rapid advancement of computers. how possible could it seem back then? but if you look at today\\'s technology, now ask yourself, what it you were a part of someone else\\'s dream. another brilliant but surreal film this year, david lynch\\'s mulholland drive explored similar areas. but vanilla sky goes deeper than any other film could hope to. in short this is one film that will literally (if you let it) blow your mind from all of the possibilities that surround you. open your eyes. tom cruise plays david aames, a young, hot shot, righteous, full of himself publisher and owner of several magazines. he inherited this from his father and although he has talent and business savvy, his board of governers, the seven dwarfs, think he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth. they feel he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them. early in the film we meet one of david\\'s gorgeous toys named julie gianni, played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by cameron diaz. david and julie play a good game, both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the slightest bit interested in a monogamous, committed relationship. this is the type of relationship commensurate with david\\'s other flings he\\'s had in the sexual prime of his life. and although both talk a good game, we can tell that only one is really telling the truth. next we meet brian shelby, played with a stroke of genius by kevin smith\\'s good buddy jason lee. brian is writing a book that david is going to publish but they are also very good friends. this is something that david has very little of in his life and you can sense a real caring for one another early on in the film. brian has one famous line that he keeps telling david over and over again. and that is \" the sweet ain\\'t so sweet without the bitter.\" he goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all of the floozies who inhabit his bed for a night or two. at david\\'s huge birthday bash, (so huge that the likes of steven spielberg wish him a happy birthday) brian enters with his date, sofia sorrano, played of course by penelope cruz with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress. this is a bash by invite only and at first david and sofia seem intrigued with one another. and in typical david fashion, despite his best friend being there, he begins to flirt with sofia. to complicate things, julie shows up uninvited and begins spying on david. david then spends the night with sofia, but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another. there is no hanky panky. the next day, as david is leaving sofia\\'s apartment, he is greeted by julie, who offers him a ride and from there.......well, i think we have all seen the commercials. that is all i will really say about the plot, because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is blurred perception. we are introduced to a character played by kurt russel and a few other shady characters that all play a part in this labyrinth like haze. there is a subtext of death and possible panacea-like cure-alls that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life. this is just one of the intriguing possibilities the movie offers us, but it doesn\\'t end there. like many movies seem to thrive on today, this film has a secret. sixth sense may have began this craze, but look even further back and you can maybe thank angel heart for starting the craze. regardless of how it originated, vanilla sky has one of it\\'s own surreptitious gut busters. and what makes this one so much fun is that the film gives you many obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the gauntlet of truth and lies you have just put yourself through. i have seen this film four times and every time it has been because i want to see if there is something more i can pick up, something more i can understand. to be able to work your mind in the theater, to enable it to open up to new possibilities is something rare in a film. all of the ersatz so called \"best pictures of the year\" have been good but nothing spectacular. they lack substance. a beautiful mind was intriguing but flat, the royal tenenbaums was interesting but uneven. vanilla sky is a rarity because it is a film that leaves you yearning for more yet guarantees your satisfaction because the film and those that made it care about it. i know this film has received mixed reviews but i just think that those who don\\'t like it don\\'t quite understand it. this is what film making is supposed to be like. this is what a film is supposed to do to you. it is supposed to make you feel something. most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces. this one isn\\'t. 10 out of 10 the best film of the year. i would love to see this get nominated for best picture and i would love to see cruz up for best actress, diaz for best supporting, cruise for best actor and jason mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor. cameron crowe should there as well. none of this may come to pass, and that is a shame. this is one film that should not be missed. and on a final note, i am quite sure mr. krisak would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question. can you prove you are real? or are we just a figment of someone\\'s imagination? are we artificially transplanted for someone else\\'s bemusement? this is a film that spawns more questions than it does answers. and i\\'m sure that is just fine with him. open your eyes i saw this film yesterday.. i rented the dvd from blockbuster.. in fact, i know one of the actresses from the film.. i won\\'t say who..! (that\\'s kept under wraps..) but i must admit, it wasn\\'t as good as i thought it would be.. tom savini? hats down to this guy.. but it\\'s a shame he wasn\\'t in the film for long.. what lacks the film is the idea, the script, sound, etc.. it may look like a good movie.. but it wasn\\'t that entertaining.. well, i\\'m glad my sister paid â£10 for renting 3 dvd\\'s from blockbuster.. i chose this one.. and i was disappointed. anyway, thumbs down for me..! not my cup of tea! 0 out of 10! i would reccomend this film to everyone. not only to the fans of the rocker luciano ligabue, but to all film-buffs. because it\\'s sincere, moving, funny and true. because ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover, and every frame of his film is made with love and care. because his characters are loved and ask to be loved. because most of the italian debut films are lousy and this one, done by an outsider, is a real joy to watch and to listen at. because stefano accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of andrea pazienza, who was, like freccia, beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin, that ligabue shows as it is, unglamorous and ugly, without indulging in easy moralisms. because it\\'s a film that speaks to our heart, our ears, our souls. and because i lived the experience of the fm radios and it was exactly like that. thanks, luciano! recognizing the picture of the diner on the cover of the dvd made me realize that this was a local movie. the word detroit in the title furthered my suspecions and i did some looking up of things and yes, a local movie it was. so i picked it up. someone i knew actually knew some of the producers/director (dont remember which) and said the producers/directors got people to pay to be in this movie. brilliant! what a great idea. the movie makers get some capital to do the movie with, thanks to their cast and crew. then the investors (cast, crew, others) get some of the profits, i\\'m imagining. profits! um anyways. this film totally underwhelmed me. the special effects were special as in special children who ride the small buses to school. the acting was very amusing, not intentionally however. there\\'s a great line where a guy says \"well? this bone aint gonna smoke itself!\" as a pickup line. unfortunately that is the only fun part of the whole film. the story? well, i sort of followed it about 3/5 of the way in, then everything stopped making sense and as we were sitting there watching it, it suddenly ended. i mean as in,..no resolution of anything..like they ran out of time. \"sorry folks, out of time, goodnight!\" we sat there baffled and booing, and threw in another film. then about 20 minutes later a neighbor of mine showed up..with one of the guys from the movie! we threw it back in and he (the actor) gave us a running commentary, which was awesome because he totally ripped on the movie! what more could you ask for?? the most absurd scene for me was a motorbike chase scene were it was so dark that it could have literally been a guy running past with a flashlight and not a motorbike at all. that and the jaw droppingly in your face sudden ending is enough to make you howl. in pain! the zombies looked less like zombies than my coworkers do. and i dont work at the morgue either. so, i recommend seeing this if you can get someone from the movie to come over and give you a running commentary as to all the things that went on behind the scenes and make sure this person hates the movie because that just adds to the fun. otherwise, give this one a pass. rent something like feeders if you want a jaw droppingly bad in a funny way movie... one hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds into this flick and i decided it was pretty lame. that was right after hopalong (chris lybbert) drops on his horse from a tree to rejoin the good guy posse. i was pretty mystified by the whole hopalong cassidy/great bar 20 gimmick which didn\\'t translate into anything at all. obviously, the name coppola in the credits couldn\\'t do anything to guarantee success here, even with more than one listed. if you make it to the end of the film, you\\'ll probably wind up asking yourself the same questions i did. what exactly was the hook with the gloves? what\\'s up with the rodeo scenario? who was the stranger supposed to represent? why did they make this film? i could probably go on but my energy\\'s been drained. look, there\\'s already a western called \"the gunfighter\" from 1950 with a guy named gregory peck as the title character. watching it will make you feel as good as watching this one makes you feel bad. that one i can recommend. caddyshack ii is nothing compared to the original caddyshack. but, there are legitimate reasons for it. (1) rodney dangerfield was supposed to be the ace of this film but he didn\\'t like the script, wanted to change it, his request was denied, so he didn\\'t do the film. (2) it was low budget, bill murray had grown to superstar status. ted knight passed away in 1986, and chevy chase the \"so called ace\" of the first movie (although it was rodney all the way)couldn\\'t\\'t be on more than 5 minutes, because it would cost too much to pay him. but you had dan aykroyd, robert stack, randy quaid and jackie mason, all serviceable substitutes, who none had their best performances. the youthful group in \"st. elmo\\'s fire\" who just graduated from college barely seem able to make it through high school much less four years at any prominent university. for the most part, these kids are irresponsible, selfish, greedy and stupid, yet co-writer and director joel schumacher appears to hold them up as touchstones for a generation. with a now-outdated cast of \"up and comers\", a background score that sounds awfully similar to that of \"terms of endearment\", and writing which lords the smugness of this circle over us, \"fire\" is a paltry blaze, one that gets even more embarrassing as the years pass on. *1/2 from **** the plot of the thinner is decidedly thin. and gross. an obese lawyer drives over the gypsy woman, and the gypsy curse causes him to lose and lose weight... to the bone. ok, gypsy curses should be entertaining, but the weight-losing gone bad? nope. except stephen king thinks so. and michael mcdowell, other horror author and the screenwriter of this abysmal film, does so, too. the lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible, he is fat too, haha! the thinner is like an immature piece of crap for a person who moans how he/she has never seen anything so disgusting than fatness. hey, i can only say: well, look at the mirror. american pie has gone a long distance from the first. at first i believe the actors don\\'t have a clue what their doing and instead it\\'s just a remake of a college party gone nuts. story sets out as two freshman college guys (featuring the young stifler) setting out the dreams of attending college just to experience the late night parties, sex and of course the booze. the plot is stupid and comes along way away from the original pie. in fact they didn\\'t once again feature an apple pie somewhere in the film. luckily i work in a video store and can rent for free. but please remember it is a waste of time unless you enjoy brainless sex films with absolute nudity and insane drinking. i\\'m a teen myself and i believe even evan almighty would\\'ve been a better choice instead. the best movie about friendship! especially between an aids infected person and a \" normal \" person. this is a great movie for everyone to see even though there is strong language used. i have seen it 25 times. revolt of the zombies has no redeeming features. i\\'m tired of people arguing that it\\'s not that bad, and that the effects must have packed more of a punch in 1936. i suspect this isn\\'t true: it\\'s not like iq\\'s have risen sharply in the last 7 decades. the average viewer in 1936 was probably just as bored by this rubbish as the average viewer today. why? just try watching the first scenes, and count the pauses between things happening, the awful choice of when to cut to close-up, the slapdash editing that seems to include an extra two seconds on every shot to pad out the running time. pay attention to the utterly redundant dialogue: \"i\\'m going to make some tea/go outside/read my book now.\" \"are you?\" \"yes, i am.\" that sort of exchange happens several times. normally i would love that, being a huge fan of bad movies, but watch the listless actors mumbling their trite and tedious lines, and all desire to laugh at the movie slowly fades away. this sort of disinterested, pot-boiling time-waster is far worse than energetic, imaginative mind-blowers like plan nine from outer space or santa claus conquers the martians. those who claim that this is \"better\" than those more interesting movies have a backwards idea of entertainment. this movie is not bad in the sense that your jaw hangs open in astonishment: it\\'s bad in the sense that your eyes slowly close in boredom. which is far worse. hilariously inept - like \"she wore a yellow ribbon\" remade by five-year-olds. spoilers ahead: despite its title, and the high bodycount, \"slaughter trail\" is in fact a musical with injun battles instead of dance numbers. if you ever wondered what ed wood might have done with a b-movie budget, this film should answer your question. some decisions may have been bad only in retrospect, such as filming in the short-lived cinecolor process, which resulted in faces changing hue within the same shot. but there was definitely some ill-advised skimping on the film\\'s main set, a cavalry fort that seems to be partly a norman castle. terry gilkyson, who later wrote the \\'the bare necessities\\' for disney\\'s \"the jungle book\", supplies a score full of original ditties which would have been wonderful for a cartoon but which fit western action like a fuzzy slipper stuck in a stirrup. one song tells how \"horse hooves pound, and their melody sounds, like the hoofbeat serenade\"...during a dead-serious scene of a cavalry patrol. other songs literally narrate the story shot by shot, introducing characters, describing their moods and gestures - as they happen on screen - and even stop to advertise the cinecolor process(!) the script sends ferocious navajos on the warpath to avenge the killing of two of their band by an outlaw trio. by the end of the film, what looks like a hundred navajos and cavalrymen have bitten the dust (thanks to repeated footage of the same characters dying over and over.) but the chief is satisfied once he sees the trio of badguys have been slain. as the singer helpfully informs those of us who weren\\'t paying attention, the navajos ride away, their battle called off. the cavalry captain, surrounded by the corpses of his fallen comrades, cheerily waves his appreciation. the direction could most charitably be described as wooden, or more to the point, wood-en. navajos are consistently shot off their horses in pairs -- never just one. virtually every red man on foot dies by throwing his hands in the air and keeling over. the film also employs the most cautious stuntmen in hollywood, who crouch before dropping off a one-story roof (and still fail to stick the landing) or turn to look behind them as they slide, \"dead\", down a rocky slope. the star is brian donlevy, who surely deserves an oscar for not blushing. after the endless final battle scene -- \"climax\" is scarcely the word -- he scans a list of the dozens of his troopers killed, and shrugs, \"it could\\'ve been a lot worse.\" trooper andy devine gets to sing and robber/murderer gig young laughs at andy\\'s antics...which leads a character who had been held up by masked bandits to rat gig out: \"i\\'d know that laugh anywhere!\" and lest anyone forget just what a nasty piece of work howard hughes could be, recall that as head of rko, hughes was first in line to blacklist original star howard da silva when huac denounced him. it would take hughes another six years to finish running that once-celebrated studio into the ground, but it didn\\'t help things when he insisted on reshooting da silva\\'s every scene for this film, substituting donlevy. it was nearly a decade before da silva was able to work in hollywood again. but all things considered, for getting him out of \"slaughter trail\", he should have sent hughes a thank-you note. oh man. if you want to give your internal crow t. robot a real workout, this is the movie to pop into the ol\\' vcr. the potential for cut-up lines in this film is just endless. (minor spoilers ahead. hey, do you really care if a film of this quality is \"spoiled?\") traci is a girl with a problem. psychology has developed names for it when a child develops a sexual crush on the opposite-sex parent. but this girl seems to have one for her same-sex one, and i don\\'t think there\\'s a term for that. it might be because her mother dana is played by rosanna arquette, whose cute overbite, neo-flowerchild sexuality and luscious figure makes me forgive her any number of bad movies or unsympathetic characters. here dana is not only clueless to her daughter\\'s conduct; she seems to be competing for the gold medal in the olympic indulgent mother competition. it\\'s possible that dana misses traci\\'s murderous streak because truth be told, traci seems to have the criminal skills of a hamster. it\\'s only because the script dictates so that she manages to pull off any kind of a body count. a particularly hilarious note in this movie is the character of carmen, a mexican maid who is described by dana as around so long she\\'s like one of the family although she dresses in what the director thought would say, \"i just fell off the tomato truck from guadalajara.\" carmen is so wise to traci\\'s scheming, she might also wear a sign saying, \"hey, i\\'m the next victim!\" sure enough, traci confronts carmen as carmen is making her way back from mass, and bops her with one of those slightly angled lug wrenches that car manufacturers put next to your spare as a bad joke. i rather suspect than in real life those things are as useless as a murder weapon as they are for changing a tire. in another sequence, arquette wears a flimsy dress to a vineyard, under cloudy skies, talking to the owner. cut to her in another flimsy dress under sunny skies, talking to the owner\\'s brother. then cut to her wearing the first dress, in the first location, under cloudy skies - but it\\'s supposed to be later. you get the picture. we\\'re talking really bad directing. as for skin, don\\'t expect much, although traci does own a nice couple of bikinis. for those looking for a trash wallow, 8. for anybody else, 1/2. this is an excellent, suspenseful, murder-mystery movie. not only was the plot full of suspense and intrigue but you get to see gorgeous ryan gosling for a couple hours, what\\'s not to love! also, sandra bullock is good in this movie - i\\'ve always been a fan of hers, (i just wish she hadn\\'t decided to be in \"the lake house\" which was horrible, but that\\'s another story altogether). obviously since there are thousands of other murder/horror movies out there, there are bound to be similarities between them, no need to bash this movie for having some similarities to at least a few that have already been made. anyway, this is a great movie for those of you that actually enjoy \"scary\" movies, it\\'s a little dark and twisted but overall a great movie!!! brides are dying at the altar, and their corpses are disappearing. everybody is concerned, but nobody seems to be able to figure out why and how this is happening, nor can they prevent it from happening. bear with me. bela lugosi is responsible for this, as he is extracting spinal fluid from these young women to transfuse his ancient wife and keep her alive. continue to bear with me. finally, the authorities figure out that somebody must be engineering the deaths and disappearances, but of course, they can\\'t figure out the improbable motive. let\\'s just ignore the ludicrous pseudoscience and move on... if you can get through the first twenty minutes of this mess, you will be treated to lugosi whipping his lab assistant for disrespecting one of the brides he has murdered, explaining that he finds sleeping in a coffin much more comfortable than a bed, and other vague parodies of real horror films (the kind with budgets and plots). anyhoo - a female journalist follows her nose to the culprit (and remarkably the inept police are nowhere to be seen!), and then the fun really starts. the cinematography and acting are ok. there are a lot of well dressed, very good looking people in this film. the directing is fair, and the script is a little better than the material deserved. nevertheless, this film fails to sustain the interest of all but the most hardened b-film fan. the best thing about it.... it does eventually end, but not soon enough. on first watching this film it is hard to know quite what has happened, but on a subsequent viewing it become more clear. i enjoyed this movie. dean cain was excellent in the role of bob. lexa doig\\'s character was confusing to understand, at first, she was out to trap bob but i really believe she landed up loving him although by then she had broken his heart. dean cain\\'s performance was an usual excellent. he gets better with every film he does. my only question at the end of the film was what happened to bob, camilla and the baby. it was left for the viewer to decide the comments already left for this show are way more funny than the show itself and they are all accurate. i feel exactly the same way, that i am very disappointed at how far rick mercer has fallen when he used to do some really great things on this hour has 22 minutes but now he is just clowning around, going places and talking to people. he does some bits in the studio about things going on in the news but they are never funny at all, just really sad and predictable jokes about headlines. most of his show is him going somewhere to talk to people, for example this week he is going to a rodeo and the video pieces are all of him making funny faces and acting scared of the wild horses, etc. he used to be funny but has gotten way less funny since leaving this hour has 22 minutes and that show is also not funny at all any more. now that air farce is off the air (finally thank goodness!) mercer and this hour has 22 minutes have got to be next in line for the axe, just old tired predictable comedy that almost nobody finds funny any more. it\\'s sad really considering rick mercer used to be the funniest man on canadian tv! wow,this is in my opinion the best sitcom since friends. if you have had a crap day just sit yourself down with a beer (if you are old enough that is.if not a root beer will have to do.) and watch a couple of episodes,it\\'s the perfect recipe for happiness. the thing i like most is that everybody in the show is very funny and they all have fantastic comedy timing. after a while you become attached to the characters and really care about them. i think the secret to the shows success is that they have an enviable life. doug is fat but still happy with it,he loves his wife his job and his friends. the father in law is the fly in the ointment but hey nothings perfect. \"ah ritchie\\'s made another gangster film with statham\" thought the average fan, expecting another snatch/lock stock; expecting perhaps a couple of temporal shifts, but none too hard for \"me and the lads\" to swallow after a few beers. ah, pay attention, you do need to watch this film. no cups of tea, no extra diet cokes from the counter, no \"keep it running\" shouts as you nip to the fridge - watch the film! no laughs other than those you may make yourself from the considerable violence (and if that floats your boat, so be it) but sharp solid direction, excellent dialogue, and great performances. my favourite - big pussy from the sopranos, always a reliable hood. i saw the glacier fox in the theatre when i was nine years old - i bugged my parents to take me back three times. i began looking for it on video about five years ago, finally uncovering a copy on an online auction site, but i would love to see it either picked up by a new distributor and rereleased (i understand the original video run was small), or have the rights purchased by the family channel, disney, etc. and shown regularly. it is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the life struggle of a family of foxes in northern japan, narrated by a wise old tree. the excellent soundtrack compliments the film well. it would be a good seller today, better than many of the weak offerings to children\\'s movies today. would you be surprised if i told you this movie deals with a conspiracy? no? how about if i told you the ringleader was a shadow puppet. what? you don\\'t believe me? ... ok. yes, i made that up. it\\'s too bad, this movie could have used a sense of humor. i understand charlie sheen doing this at the time - another movie equaled more money - as for donald sutherland and linda hamilton ... why? don\\'t even get me started on stephen lang. he was so much fun as the party crasher in \\'the hard way\\' and now this junk. ah no matter. everyone involved should feel ashamed. if you aim to make a bad movie and succeed - it\\'s twisted - but i seriously doubt that was what they were aiming for here. flat out, the story stinks and we\\'re actually supposed to take this yak seriously. makes you wonder if this movie even had a glimmer of hope. seriously, i doubt it and in an industry so tight with the purse strings how this got green lit in the first place is beyond me. maybe even more scary is how this dog pile made it\\'s way to theaters!? oh ... sam waterson, how great you are in law & order. why are you here? demoting yourself to the role of the president of the united states who might i add gets to be shot at by a remote control biplane controlled by the gonzo assassin. then again this is a masterpiece of work from george p. cosmatos who\\'s \"directing\" credits include rambo: first blood part ii amongst other gems. hmm.... case in point? this film was absolutely...ugh i can\\'t find the word oh wait... crap! i mean when it started i was like yeah this looks good and then after it was so boring. i nearly fell asleep and it had nothing to do with the fact that i caught a late showing because it was utter filth. ram gopal varma has tried his best but the cast could never live up to the cast of the original sholay i mean what was he thinking doing a remake. what was he trying to do? be like sanjay leeli bhansani and win all the awards next year like he did for black? ajay and that other guy were good especially the other guy who played raj because out of all of them he was the one to look at. what was amitabh doing? he\\'s destroying his own dignity by doing all these stupid films. first nishabd then cheeni kum then jhoom barabar jhoom and now this i mean hes got to gather a bit of his money and move as far away from bollywood as possible before he loses all his respect and i\\'m telling you he\\'s already past half his way. i mean all this is really good for the other actors like shah rukh khan who\\'s getting a really good name now because of the recent downfall of amitabh. i never really liked him because he thinks he\\'s god and i just knew abhishek was going to be in that movie. if you want to save your â£17.75 and spend it on something good go watch heyy babyy because that\\'s just the funniest movie ever and it\\'s number one in the charts! french cinema sucks! down with all these psychiotric visions with their my-god-am-i-cultivated distinguished attitudes! pestilence to conceited symbolic film-language and impervious chiffres! i\\'ll no longer have a mind for that! lã©os carax, did you ever think about, that a dialogue in a film could be natural and vivid??? maybe i\\'m too common to understand you? or had it been your task to confirm all the clichã©s of a frenchman the world can have? guillaume the to-be-guilliotined comes to his home-palace, mme. deneuve, not in the picture, plays the flute: \"here am i, darling!\" in this moment, i knew, that she\\'s in the bathtub, and we`ll see her lying in there soon. don\\'t misunderstand me, i\\'m not prudish, and the incestous sex scene was the climax of the film. but this is, in berlin, we say \"etepetete\", what means something like \"ãªtre-peut-ãªtre\", a snobistic, self-satisfied, and, the worst, seen that often in french movies i can tell! other example: she, beautiful and willing, is looking at herself in a mirror, combing her hair, and her wild-bearded, dirty young guru rushs into the room, breathless shouting: \"there\\'s no escape, there\\'s no escape!\" forty years after existencialistic sartres and consorts- what\\'s new, what\\'s exciting about? my god, there\\'s that woman and she loves and admires you, what would be more natural to be happy with your life? and when you\\'re not, please explain much better, why!! born french means you have to live a life in extravaganza, no escape, is that the point? in the 2nd of his historical martial arts films, chiba portrays his real life sensei mas oyama. the film even recreates oyama\\'s incredible feat of killing a raging bull with his bare hands (oyama did this feat over 50 times in real life). dynamic fight choreography featuring authentic kyokushinkai techniques. ironically this is one of the rare sonny chiba films in which he doesn\\'t tear out or rip off body parts of opponents. a must see for sonny chiba fans definitely one of his top 5 films sure, we all like bad movies at one time or another, and we in fact enjoy them, this however, wasn\\'t even a guilty pleasure, it was just crap. some guy, vince offer, who is conceited enough to make himself the main character while probably got drunk/high--probably both--and thought it was a great idea to make a movie. he then proceeded to show his script to equally high/drunk individuals. overall, this movie was so bad, predictable, and unoriginal i couldn\\'t get through 20 minutes of it before i turned it off. it makes you got served look like citizen kane. bat man? wtf...some guy that walks around with a bat, real original. almost as good as calling him fat man, and having a fat guy walk around in a superhero outfit. a comedy that worked surprisingly well was the little british effort \"the divorce of lady x (1938)\" . it marks the first pairing of laurence olivier and merle oberon, before that little film about uncontrollable passion on the 19th century english moors. and while olivier and oberon are not particularly well-suited to screwball comedy, it all flows along nicely. oberon is leslie, a young woman who ends up in priggish divorce lawyer logan\\'s (olivier) hotel suite by way of a nasty english fog preventing travel. she does everything possible to irritate him--but, in the crazy way films go, he falls for her. and she falls for him. but a serious case of mistaken identity occurs when oberon\\'s \"lady x\" (that\\'s all she leaves oliver in a note) is thought by olivier to be a married woman. to make matters worse, and more amusing, lord mere (ralph richardson) goes to olivier wanting a divorce from his wife whom dear larry thinks must be oberon! there is some nice battle-of-the-sexes dialogue, and fun exploration of sexual politics. you can see that olivier is not too confident with the comedy, but in true olivier he\\'s a consummate professional, and delivers. and he handles the screwball twists and turns, maybe not with ease, but with gusto. oberon was no great shakes as an actress, but she was usually competent enough, and despite their reputed off-screen dislike of her, worked well with olivier. this was filmed in early technicolour that looks very primitive today (everyone looks even whiter than michael jackson), but perhaps the print needs cleaning up. this movie is one of the most provocative jesus movies i have ever seen. it does not seek to tell the whole story, but only to portray an interpretive expression of the last day of jesus christ. it is darkly witty, playful and seriously faithful to elements of the jewish tradition and to modern scriptural interpretation. judas is much more ordinary than other portrayals, not the dark and sinister evil that we sometimes imagine, but a grossly mistaken man, horribly misguided in his zeal. chris saranden\\'s jesus is playful and serious, faithful and committed--very human while also divine. the final dialog is thoughtfully done and serves as the kind of small talk that two powerful men might do when they have just committed an atrocity. i would watch this movie again and recommend it to others. this is one of the most ridiculous westerns that hollywood ever made. gary cooper plays \\'reb hollister\\', a former confederate officer wanted by the law. he meets up with a moron named weatherby, played by leif erickson, who is a u.s. marshal with no knowledge of firearms. weatherby is on his way to dallas to see his fiancee, tonia robles, played by ruth roman. senor robles, tonia\\'s father, has plenty of men, but they can\\'t seem to be able to keep an eye on his cattle, which are regularly rustled by the marlow brothers. will marlow, played by raymond massey, has financed the loan on the robles estate, making things completely absurd. he even has the power to call for mortgage payments before they\\'re due, simply because he feels like it. since weatherby is a boston boy who can\\'t fight, since he only became a marshal so he could visit his fiancee, tonia, (just another instance of more plot nonsense. are we to assume that you only have to pass a written test to get this job? wait a minute, this guy couldn\\'t pass the written test either.) he switches identities with reb hollister, who of course is an expert gunman. reb takes the liberty of greeting weatherby\\'s girl with a passionate kiss, while weatherby looks on like an idiot. gary cooper, hollywood\\'s number one stud, is in fine form here as reb. before the movie\\'s done, not only does he take weatherby\\'s job, he steals his fiancee also, and ruth roman as tonia, falls for him so hard and so fast that she gives chump leif erickson the brush-off before the films little more than half over. there isn\\'t a shred of plot credibility in the whole film, so despite the good cast and lush photography, the film is a dud. and cooper\\'s character is a complete heel to boot. the film also stars barbara payton as brant marlow\\'s girl, a beautiful and talented actress who squandered away her chances, unfortunately, by making too many headlines for the wrong reasons. i strongly suggest you pass this one up. this kind of \"inspirational\" saccharine is enough to make you sick. it telegraphs its sentiments like the biggest semaphore on earth. it removes from the audience its own interpretation and feeling by making the choices for it. the big finish is swimming in weeping orchestration that must supposed to work like jumper cables on a dead car; i guess you\\'d need such prompting to feel if you\\'re stupid enough to watch a film as simple-minded and sappy as this. streep glows and you wonder if she really has the depth of feeling on display or if it\\'s just that---a display, switched on and off like a light. because i can\\'t for the life of me see how she could possibly find life in such a dud of film. even though it\\'s based on a true story, and an inspirational one at that i\\'m sure, the set-up, execution and performances play like a third-rate tv movie or half-witted high school drama. true love, i truly enjoyed and loved this movie. it was fun, funny and inspirational. i just saw it on dvd. how did i miss this one it\\'s a winner! i mean flex was \"that guy\". i wanted to marry him. this was my 1st time seeing him as a straight leading man and he pulls it off. i thought tangi miller was the best ever and i was a felicity head too. a fearless woman who only fears her nana. thank you for giving women of color range in your work and she looks great! tasha smith was a blast! aloma wright was priceless as nana. this cute romantic comedy is \"a must see\". oh and the new comer marcus patrick is worth the surprise ladies...true love. karen i had watched snippets from this as a kid but, while i purchased blue underground\\'s set immediately due to its being a limited edition, only now did i fit it in my viewing schedule - and that\\'s mainly because bakshi\\'s american pop (1981) just turned up on late-night italian tv (see my review of that film below)! anyway, i found the film to be a quite good sword-and-sorcery animated epic with especially impressive-looking backdrops (the rather awkward rotoscoped characters were, admittedly, less so) with a rousing if derivative score. the plot, again, wasn\\'t exactly original, but proved undeniably engaging on a juvenile level and the leading characters well enough developed - especially interesting is the villainous ice-lord nekron and the enigmatic warrior darkwolf; the hero and heroine, however, are rather bland stereotypes - but one can hardly complain when bakshi and frazetta depict the girl as well-endowed (her bra could be torn off any second) and half-naked to boot (her tiny panties are forever disappearing up her ass)! still, it\\'s clearly an action-oriented piece and it certainly delivers on this front (that involving darkwolf being particularly savage); the final showdown though brief, is also nicely handled and sees our heroes astride pterodactyls assaulting the villains\\' lair inside a cave . in the long run, apart from the afore-mentioned frazetta backdrops, the main appeal of this movie for me now is its nostalgia factor as it transported me back to my childhood days of watching not just films like conan the barbarian (1982) and the beastmaster (1982) but also animated tv series such as blackstar (1981-82) and he-man and the masters of the universe (1983-85). as for the accompanying the making of \"fire and ice\" (tv) (mark bakshi, 1982) **1/2: vintage featurette on the sword-and-sorcery animated film which is only available via the washed-out vhs print owned by ralph bakshi himself! it goes into some detail about the rotoscope technique and also shows several instances of live-action \\'performances\\' (in a studio) of segments from the script - which would then be traced, blended in with the backgrounds and filmed. still, having watched several such behind-the-scenes featurettes on the art of animation (on the disney tins and the looney tunes sets, for instance), it\\'s doesn\\'t make for a very compelling piece... i play final fantasy 7, and this movie is excellent like the game, all fans of final fantasy will love this movie. the music are fantastic and the history is good, but, the best of this movie is the visual effects, are amazing. the characters are equal to the game and that detail are good for the fans. you don\\'t need play the game to like this movie, all the people can enjoy the film, because the history is some different and is easy to understand. i buy the dvd because is excellent, is 100% advisable, if you don\\'t see this film, what you waiting for? believe me,you will fascinate like me if you are under 13 or above 13 and pretty intoxicated, you\\'ll enjoy d-war. if you are a seriously dedicated fan of all kinds of brainless action films, you\\'ll enjoy d-war. otherwise, don\\'t bother! i saw the movie today with my nephews and 3 of their friends. they really loved it and that made me feel good. after the movie was over, all the kids(my nephews and their friends)could not stop thanking me for taking them to the theater. the cg is good. acting and directing are horrible. storyline is extremely simple. but, since the half of the audience was kids, they were screaming, shouting and cheering every time the dragons appeared on the screen. this made the viewing experience far more exciting than it should have been. it\\'s a good movie to take your kids to, but except for the final battle sequence, d-war is disappointing. i give this film 7 out of 10 mainly because the kids loved it so much. no wonder pamela springsteen gave up acting to become a full-time photographer; it\\'s a much better idea to have her behind a camera than in front of one. while this movie is not without its interesting elements (mullets from hell, etc.), it is outweighed by flaws. for one thing, angela, the murderous counselor, appears to be about the same age as the campers. having an older, more threatening camp director would have done a lot for the film. and then you have the murder scenes. the budget was apparently too low to execute most of them properly (no pun intended), although drowning someone in an outhouse toilet is certainly original. but overall, there are a ton of movies out there that are scarier/more fun to spend an hour and a half of your life watching. this has to be, by far, the absolute worst movie i have seen in the last 20 years. when i saw that michael madsen was in it i figured it couldn\\'t be too bad a movie since he has been in some pretty decent films, and he was a pretty fair actor. wrong! no one should waste their time on this film. i fast forwarded through 80 percent of it and i don\\'t feel that i missed a thing. had ned kelly been born later he probably would have won a victoria cross at gallipolli\\'. such was ned\\'s bravery. in australia and especially country victoria the name ned kelly can be said and immediately recognised. in greta he is still a hero, the life blood of the town of jerilderie depends on the tourism he created, but in mansfield they still haven\\'t forgotten that the three policeman that he \\'murdered\\' were from there. many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing. from the old melbourne gaol where he was hanged, to the post office he held up in jerilderie. a cell he was once held in in greta is on display in benella and the site of ann jones\\' hotel, the station and even the logs where he was captured in glenrowan can be visited. evidence of all the events in the movie (except for his love interest) can be found all over victoria, in police records and even in the sash that ned was awarded with for rescuing dick shelton from drowning. none of this is wrong, and whats left out would further justify neds actions. the horse that ned \\'stole\\' was actually stolen by wild wright (the man who ned boxes with after getting out of jail). ned was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen so he couldn\\'t have stolen it. the jerilderie letter is more than what has been stated before. it is not self justification it is ned\\'s biography, an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting. so go ahead and read it, watch the movie and then make up your mind about what ned stood for. \"feast of all saints?\" where...? when...? was the feast of all saints storyline and theme edited out? what a waste of a wonderful title! there is never anything in the story that has the remotest connection to the \"feast of all saints.\" nor is there anything in the story about \"all souls day\" which the term is referencing. why bother to use this title if you never intend to including any kind of storyline or theme about \"all souls day\" or the \"feast of all saints\"? embarrassly bad script & amateur writing how did they attract such great talent to this clunker? the writing is so amateur--characters that have known each other all their life go into big long speeches about their life history for the sake of the audience. not at all the way people talk to each other. what was the director thinking? the directing is equally bad! the forced and overly deliberate style feels amateurish. in one scene, a character is yelling \"take your hands off of me\" and no one is touching him! the most badly directed scene however, is the incredibly over-the-top battle scene at the beginning of the film. excessive gore in a very fake, silly battle scene there are so many dead people in the most fake battle scene. it looks like a saturday night live skit!! you can see extras waiting for their cues to walk across camera. everyone plays their death scene like 4th grade boys--exaggerating every little gasp and twitch. the blood on battle victims is so excessive and carelessly applied it looks like someone used a ketchup dispenser and just squirted straight lines of red on the costumes. this whole battle scene comes off as the spoof of a really cheesy war movie. you almost expect someone like will ferrell and mike myers to ride up on a horse and deliver the punchline. who in real life would ever behave this way?! the most ridiculous bit of writing, directing and casting is actually the focus of the scene: a little girl is standing under the dead body of her hanging father--who is terribly mutilated, and literally dripping blood form his gaping wounds. even a totally idiot would know he is dead! yet she is--very monotonously--repeating over and over \"daddy, daddy...\" while looking at someone off-screen. she delivered it with about as much believability and passion as you could expect from an non-actor kid that had been repeating the line for the cameras all day. even if the poor kid had any acting skills, the scene is completely unbelievable. the little girl wouldn\\'t even be in the middle of the battlefield after hours of carnage--surrounded by hundreds of dead bodies, while she calmly stands there!! natural instincts would had the kid screaming and terrified, running away from the bloody carnage! are we suppose to be horrified or laugh...?! one particularly goofy detail, that gives the scene an snl satire tone, is the father hanging, with a huge hook through his mouth and cheek. he looks like a fish on a hook! the unintentionally funny details, make the whole scene come across as fake and silly. in fantasy la-la-land, mothers and daughters are the same age! another funny detail, is that you see a central character--the little girl\\'s mother--at the end of the scene and in the next scene, that occurs 20+ years later, she looks exactly the same! she is still young and beautiful, and now the same age as her daughter! i almost turned the movie off right there because the direction and writing were obviously awful--but i tried to stick it out because i wanted to see the louisiana settings and i like all the actors. i don\\'t know what these fine actors were thinking when they accepted these roles! who was the targeted audience? the excessive amount of blood and badly acted violence in the opening scene are weirdly out of place with the soap opera storytelling tone that follows. it is also a strange way to start a movie that, for the rest of the time, seems targeted to romance novel reading females. weird inconsistency in tone! i now that these days, some people wan\\'t see a movie without movie styling, so much dogma, lars von, watchosky brothers, are changed what we expect in a movie, perhaps, casomai is no-one-more-independent-non-american movie, the movie take all movies resources and language to tell us a simple history about love and marriage, but much more .. fully of views, lectures and let you thinking ... and i\\'m sure, you can\\'t fell boried any second of a long 116 minutes. i calculate that don\\'t have a single scene longer that 3 o 2 1/2 minutes. okay. i really tried to tap into the (so called) silly & surreal humor that this film sets out to be. i\\'m told that the japanese version of this film is much shorter than the one shipped to america (go figure!), and has less political references. apart from all that, i found this sexual/political farce just as boring and pointless as standard porn. the central female lead is easy on the eyes, and could actually act. i would love to see her in a non pink film where she could actually flex her acting muscles (and no,not the ones you\\'re thinking of). it\\'s obvious that japan can (and does)produce just as much crap as other countries. i couldn\\'t recommend this to anyone, with the distant possibility of someone who has a jones for asian porn. go see a real japanese film. australian fred schepisi (a cry in the dark) directs this comedy/ romance that is fun, relaxing, and set in the spring. you will laugh while watching this movie. tim robbins (shawshank redemption, dead man walking) is an auto mechanic, ed walters, with a high iq, which gets higher with the help of albert einstein, walter matthau (grumpy old men) and his academic friends nathan, kurt and boris. you can tell them by their preppie shoes. meg ryan (sleepless in seattle, you\\'ve got mail) is catherine boyd, einstein\\'s niece who is a competent, but not so confident mathematician. perhaps it is because she is surrounded by all that genius. she thinks that if she marries someone with a high i.q. her kids will have a high i.q. as well, but she does not knows what she wants. between tim robbins cute smile and meg\\'s cuteness this is a refreshing movie. i love sweet stories. people all ages should enjoy this movie. catherine is engaged to the jerk james moreland, who works in animal behavior, but is very stuffy. this is a love a first sight type situation, between the mechanic and the mathematician. witty lines and subliminal lines! the cinematography is nice. princeton, new jersey is beautiful in the spring. with much help from all those brilliant men catherine falls for ed, without knowing that he is an automobile mechanic. favorite scenes: ed taking a multiple choice test in front of a crowd with the help of einstein, nathan, kurt, and boris. ed and einstein riding on the motorcycle. nathan, kurt and boris letting all the research animals free! favorite quotes: albert einstein: \"don\\'t let your brain interfere with your heart\". ed walters: \"when was the last time he said \"wahoo\"\"? catherine boyd: \"well i\\'m sure i don\\'t know\". this is a refreshing movie, i recommend it. i have the tape and every once and awhile i will watch it again. this one is a great one! robert de niro and cuba gooding have teamed up to make a powerful and very influential film. this is the true story of the first black us navy diver and the obstacles he faced in attaining his certification at the hands of a racist master diver. along the way, he must also face plain old bigotry from all of his classmates, none of whom want him in their class. they move out of the barracks when he arrives. ultimately, he becomes certified and goes on to have a great career as a us navy diver. watch this one! it\\'s a great tale of courage and honor. as the story unfolds, we get to watch racism slowly dissipate and everyone begins to respect men one at a time. i don\\'t really consider myself a conservative, so i wasn\\'t personally offended by this film, but it was pretty clear that the plot and the characterization in this film were secondary to the message. and the message is that all conservatives are either evil or stupid (or both). the characters are one-dimensional -- either good, freedom-loving americans, or brainless, greedy, evil conservatives. there\\'s nothing clever or creative, just anti-conservative. i don\\'t really mind the political bias itself, but it shouldn\\'t be the only purpose behind the movie. and clearly it is. on the positive side, the cast is wonderful and chris cooper\\'s impression of w is funny the first two or three times, but after that it\\'s just the same old joke being told over and over again. so if you really hate the conservatives, you\\'ll probably enjoy this film, but if you\\'re looking for something with realistic characters and a story that\\'s less black-and-white, then you\\'d be better off watching something else. this is really good. original ideas in the film and a great terrorist action film. only second to die hard and die hard with a vengeance, this film has suspense and a good plot. i would recommend it to anyone with a taste in films like mine; action, terrorism and gangster/mafia. rajkumar santoshi without any doubt has directed the greatest movies and biggest box office hits of indian cinema. this movie falls short of all expectations as this movie stars two great actors mr. amitabh bachchan and akshay kumar and when you have these two actors in the same movie you have to make a magnum opus. in the later part of the movie you can make out that amitabh bachchan\\'s voice has been dubbed by some other person which was due to his illness. still the movie did\\'nt had proper character development plus cinematography was\\'nt good too and one thing that bollywood should learn is that they should use visual effects only when it is needed and when applied should be done with a high budget.the script had so many flaws which gives the viewer excuses to attend his phone calls rather than watching the movie. the new comer shakes the leg well but could not act well but where the movie loses big time is the storyline screenplay and cinematography. a talented actor like bhoomika chawla has been wasted in the movie as well as sushant singh. but every director once in a while in his career makes a bad film. so watch it only if you are a fan of multi-starrer flop movies. a poetic examination of the human condition performed without dialogue. the anti-hero, the man builds a contraption to escape a band of marauders, out of the wastland of what was once a civilization, to the ruins of the city to scavenge for his survival. there he crosses pathes with the brute, brilliantly played by jean reno, of \"the professional\" and \"mission: impossible\" fame. the man is rescued by a crazy old genius who lives in a fortress of his own design. by using their wits, the man and the old genius are able to keep the brute and his ilk at bay, but they realise it is only a matter of time before their defenses are compromised, so they make a break for it. this is a strongly understated tale of the desparate struggle for life, with excellent action scenes and clever humor. of all of the movies of its kind, like \"road warrior\", \"omega man\", and even \"ultimate warrior\" (featuring yul brenner as a buff knife-fighter), \"le dernier combat\" is the most artfully crafted. copies of the video are hard-to-find, i would give my left eye ball for one. if your local art house ever has a revival of this film, i heartily recommend that you break any engagement to able to be able to see it big. it\\'s true that you always remember what you were doing at a point when disaster or tragedy strikes. and none more so that september 11, 2001, a date which changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorism. no, this documentary didn\\'t set out to be dwelling on the events leading to 9/11. rather, the filmmakers, brothers gã©dã©on and jules naudet, set out to do a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a rookie new york firefighter. they had gone to the academy and done some shoots of training, and had handpicked their \"proby\" (probation firefighter) to join them in an ny firehouse, home to ladder 1 and engine 7. but their production was to develop and contain at that time, believed to be the only shot of the first plane slamming into the world trace center. i was traveling back with a friend on the train from a night of lan gaming, and received a call at about 850pm local time from my dad, who informed me of the above. few minutes later, he told me there was another, and that the wtc was under attack. by the time i arrived home, the upper floors of the twin towers were ablaze and in smoke, and to my horror, they collapsed, under an hour. the filmmakers had two cameras running that day, one who had followed a team out on a routine call, and which immediately raced to the wtc upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it. we follow what is possible the only filmed sequence of events in the lobby of wtc1 where the first responders of firefighters, paramedics, and police had to make sense of what happened, and to quickly develop a plan of action. the other camera, held by the other brother, was making his way to wtc to look for his sibling, and along the journey, captured the many expressions of new yorkers, as well as the sense of chaos in and around manhatten. peppered throughout the documentary are numerous interviews with the men from ladder 1 and engine 7, which miraculously, did not suffer any casualty. but being survivors also brought about its own set of psychological turmoil, as they struggle to come to terms with the event. through the events that unfold, we learn of the strong camaraderie amongst these men who risk live and limb each day on their jobs, to save lives. we began with what the documentary was supposed to be, before events of the day totally swung in and became the focus, right up to the rescue phase where hopes of finding survivors under the rubble were kept alive by the men who work round the clock in making sense of the collapsed steel structures. it\\'s not a film that is fabricated, and what you see here cannot be recreated in any other documentary (and heavens, not sound stages for hollywood blockbusters). it\\'s as close as you can get to that day, witnessing the event up close, from safety. code 1 dvd contains a separate extra hour of 4 sets of interviews with the men of ladder 1 and engine 7. oh, my. oh, this is a *really* bad movie. the acting is absolutely atrocious, the script is god-awful, and the photography is simply dreadful. what does make this movie stand out, however, is that you never once care about a single soul-- good guy or bad guy, living, dying or dead-- in the entire 87 minutes. \"oh, s/he died? huh... figured they would\" was the best reaction i could muster after each murder. characters are so black-or-white that with the volume turned off, you could still figure out who was who. while the cast\\'s voices had an odd monotone quality throughout, their faces give the impression that you\\'re looking at an old silent movie with a lot of eyebrow waggling, exaggerated frowns and \"pensive looks\". each character is a humorless, passionless, one-dimensional one-trick pony; once they fulfill whatever their particular role in this fiasco demanded their creation, they are summarily dismissed. it vaguely made me think of what would happen if thomas borch nielsen (director/writer of \"skyggen\", american title: \"webmaster\") decided to do a low-budget version of \"american psycho\" and got kind of distracted along the way. this isn\\'t a particularly gruesome movie; the cold, passionless cast ensures that. it isn\\'t an offensive movie; the director plays it so safe that no one could possibly find it so. it is, simply and after all, a bad movie. avoid it. we were not so fortunate and actually paid to watch this bomb on pay-per-view. as part of my penance, i\\'m writing this review. enough said. i was in my mid teens when i saw this movie, and i was struck by the beauty of the young stars as well as the loving cinematography and the simple sweetness of the story. it amazes me to learn that alvina has recently died, that bury apparently has not worked in the film business for almost 30 years, and that both would be in their 50s. the elton john soundtrack is amazingly beautiful and supports the air of protected innocence the characters experience in seclusion. i have seen the movie poster, billing it as \"deux enfants quis\\'aiment,\" which apparently means something like \"two children who like each other\"--the english language distributors were wise to abbreviate the title! paul, the ignored 15-year-old son of an english businessman living in paris, meets michelle, an orphan, at the zoo. the two take what they intend as a day-long holiday to michelle\\'s late father\\'s rural cottage, but end up staying there for a year, isolated from the outside world. they fall in love, michelle gets pregnant, and they have the baby alone at home. after the baby\\'s birth, the police come to paul\\'s work place and take him away. \"blue lagoon\" comes to mind as another film that almost captures the theme of innocence protected in an isolated paradise. so sad that \"friends\" has never been released on dvd. when braveheart first came out, i was enthralled, and was admittedly one of the most rabid fans of the film. when rob roy came out, i was intrigued, and although i enjoyed the film i did not think it was a great film. however, as time has gone by, my appreciation for rob roy has grown, and my enthusiasm for braveheart has diminished. braveheart is great entertainment, to be sure, but there are flaws as well. the most significant, in my view, is the unflattering portrayal of robert the bruce, who was without a doubt scotland\\'s greatest king. another is the historical inaccuracy of the film, which tarnishes the film in proportion to the many historical distortions. i think i am also bothered by the fact that it was in this film, seen only (at least by me) in retrospect, that the beginnings of mel gibson\\'s egomania can be seen clearly for the first time. in contrast, rob roy has grown on me over the years. partly because it largely avoids the faults i mind most in braveheart. but also because rob roy is like fine wine, growing more mature and complex with each viewing. the french either make pro-marxist films or anti-marxist films - with a few in between. \"merci pour le chocolat\" is the latter of this genre. from the opening credits telling the viewer what music is going to be played and by whom it was who composed you know that you are going to be swathed in middle class pretension. it is an old man\\'s film with an excess of 40\\'s plus people. it is also directed by an old man along with an old crew who have nothing to say about life to the viewer. the plot is not only banal but preposterous. how many films reveal the plot through dialogue only to repeat the same message via flashback some five minutes later? maybe the director and actors had a low retentive capacity? in truth their is no tenable plot at all. it is riddle with holes like a good piece of french cheese. whether intentional or not, it is a film about the bourgeoisie. at least a third of the film focuses on the piano and the pretentious twaddle espoused in each scene. i concede it has some well framed shots though they couldn\\'t have used a steady-cam in this film - it would have woke them all up! other than it being a nonsense story, the film allows the upper middle class to parade their values and vanity in a very comfortable swiss location. a telling line of the film is when rodolphe pauly tells anna mouglalis that she need not lock her car while in the resort! oh dear me. on the dvd, miss huppert makes a comment about shedding a false tear for a scene. smirking she says: \"like they do in the american actor\\'s studio!\" i think miss huppert and the rest of the cast could learn well from the actor\\'s studio. if there is one statement that stand out in my mind it is when huppert remarks \\'we are having friends for the weekend and all the servants are away\\'. no doubt they had all escaped from the mind numbing set lest they be associated with such an appalling film. safety medical note. in the film they show a hot water scald being covered with ointment and a bandage. this should never be done. only cold water should be used. minus 10 marks. a gem of a british caper-comedy. poor american schlub pinky green (richard jordan, playing another bad guy but this time an adorable one) gets out of a british jail and tries to go straight, but his maintenance man job in a bank is too attractive for his never-reformed criminal friends, headed up by a really nasty ivan (david niven in one of his last roles). pinky resists, but the lure of all that money is just too much for him. things unravel and reravel and it\\'s all joyous to watch. jordan must have played 20 bad guys in his career, but he never played the same one twice - this one is just too lovable to hate. niven never played a slicker bad guy, oil all over. two fine actors we\\'ve lost that i wish we had back. how this has not become a cult film i do not know. i think it has been sadly overlooked as a truly ingenious comedy! \"runaway car\" attempts to pass itself off as a fast-paced thriller, but taking the quality of acting (good god it\\'s bad), the storyline, the practicalities of the car\\'s demonic possession and the baby evacuation scene into account there is nothing you can really do but laugh. and laugh you will. films are made to entertain us, and the degree to which they do this can be an indication of a film\\'s worth. this film is the pinnacle in entertainment, i laughed from beginning to end. at one point i got short of breath and nearly choked, it really is that funny at some points. when the baby was airlifted out of the sunroof in a holdall by a helicopter with a robot pilot who managed to maintain a constant velocity identical to the car and a perfectly flat flight plain that meant the grapple hook didn\\'t rip the car roof to pieces, i was laughing hysterically. but when the baby starting swinging around in the air, nearly hit a bridge and almost got tangled up in a tree, tears were running down my face. it also occurred to me that the black cop was the guy who played jesus in madonna\\'s \"like a prayer\" video. he seems to get everywhere. skullduggery is a strange, strange film based on the novel \"ye shall know them\" by vercors. to unleash criticism at the film feels really unkind, since it is a movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity, and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance. but in spite of its honourable intentions and its well-meaning tone, skullduggery simply isn\\'t a very good film. for me, the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which can\\'t make its mind up how best to convey its message. the first half of the movie is like watching a standard jungle expedition flick of the tarzan ilk; later it teeters into sci-fi fable; by the end it slips into courtroom melodramatics. the differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great, too jarring, to overlook. they stick out like a sore thumb and remind you constantly that you\\'re watching a muddled, disorganised movie. an archaeological expedition into the jungles of new guinea is led by adventurer douglas temple (burt reynolds). one of the main archaeologists involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist dr sybil greame (susan clark). after an arduous trek they stumble upon a tribe of strange ape-like creatures. these primitive, long-lost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man. there is some evidence that they may the ancestors of early man â– the \"missing link\" in the evolution of apes into humans. or perhaps a race of humans who simply look and behave differently from usual? or even a race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics? the archaeologists call the tribe \"the tropi\" and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery. but things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist vancruysen (paul hubschmid) declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers. he questions whether the tropi are truly \"human\" and takes his argument to the courts, where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continued. this was a very early film in reynolds\\' career, and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like he\\'s in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously. not that reynolds can be blamed â– he has an impossible role, asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a tarzan flick. his character and the film are not relevant to each other. clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist, and there are nice supporting roles for british actors edward fox, alexander knox and wilfrid hyde-white. a major shortcoming in skullduggery is the lame and ineffective make-up used to give the tropi their strange hairy appearance. rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids, the stuck-on hair merely makes them look unintentionally comicalâ…. and that\\'s just not the right idea. we\\'re meant to feel great sympathy for these creatures, but that\\'s awfully hard when they look so unconvincing. skullduggery is a failed attempt to tell a story that could have been poignant, philosophical and stimulating. the honourable intentions are there for all to see, but the end result doesn\\'t do them justice. a worthy failure it might be but a failure nonetheless. why is it that in the \\'50s and \\'60s, italians made so of the best movies, and then during the \\'70s and \\'80s, made nothing but zombie and cannibal movies? probably because art films didn\\'t make any money. , the cannibal movie, unlike the zombie movie, which was created by americans and `exploited\\' by italians, is a purely italian creation, designed as a mondo exploitation showcase, and to make as much money as possible (no artistic integrity getting in the way here). eaten alive came during the cannibal movie heyday. the director, umberto lenzi, hadn\\'t even hit his stride yet; his genre classic, cannibal ferox, was still a year away. in plotting similar to (read: ripped off from) ruggero deodato\\'s seminal cannibal classic, cannibal holocaust, a woman (janet agren) receives word from the police that they\\'ve received a 8mm film from her sister. she\\'s gone missing in africa, and it\\'s suspected that the tribal ritual depicted on the film may have something to do with it. mel ferrer, as a professor of somethingoranother, tells her that a man named jonas (ivan rassimov) has started a jonestown-like cult in new guinea, and that\\'s where the sister is. the woman hires a guide (robert kerman) to take her through the jungle to find the cult and her sister. and, wouldn\\'t you know it, the jungle is full of cannibals. one sentence should sum it up: if you\\'ve seen on cannibal movie, you\\'ve seen them all, mostly because these films steal shamelessly from each other (lenzi copied cannibal holocaust to make this film, and retooled this to make cannibal ferox; deodato copied parts of this for hit and run). and because they all share the same material, they all feature the same traits: awful photography, boring scenery, terrible dubbing, overacting, and exploitation, exploitation, exploitation. genre fans will have a ball since everyone in it is a genre veteran. rassimov and kerman have a scenery eating contest. agren exists solely to be naked, raped, or in peril. plenty o\\' gore for all the sickos out there. the cannibals, who do actually appear to be native cannibals, eat lunch met disguised as human flesh. and, in the grand tradition of cannibal movies, any live animal shown onscreen is usually killed shortly thereafter. overall, really not a good experience, but i\\'m sure there are psychopaths out there who find this excrement entertaining. i know i did. one of the most magnificent movies ever made. the acting of charles buchinski (later known as bronson) is simply outstanding. this is the crown on the career of director winner, who himself was often quoted saying this was his masterpiece. the plot has been copied many times, but it\\'s never been topped. wildey j. moore, the gun manufacturer, many times claimed his brand\\'s growth since the mid 80s can be fully credited to dw3, and rightly so. this is not just a movie, this is art that many generations will admire and appreciate. although this movie has never been fully appreciated in the usa, it has found a huge following in europe and asia, where the movie is regularly shown at film schools and it is still a popular hit in student cinemas all across europe. all in all, a true classic. i just caught \"wild rebels\" on one of the \"mystery science theatre 3000\" archive compilations, and this movie was so bad even the mst3k crew couldn\\'t make it entertaining. there are some mst3k \"targets\" that were films whose concepts were so dippy they couldn\\'t possibly have been good movies (like \"the green slime\"), and others whose basic premises could have been made into genuinely entertaining films if their filmmakers hadn\\'t bobbled them in the execution. \"wild rebels\" is a film whose basic premise did make a good movie three years earlier, when don siegel directed his remake of \"the killers\" at universal. both films are about a failed racing driver who\\'s seduced by a femme fatale into driving the getaway car in a robbery masterminded by the woman\\'s boyfriend -- only in \"the killers\" the driver was john cassavetes, the woman was angie dickinson and the criminal mastermind (cast wildly but successfully against type in what turned out to be his final film) was ronald reagan. steve alaimo, bobbie byers and willie pastrano are quite a comedown! but what really makes \"wild rebels\" an awful movie is the direction by william grefã© (note the accent over the final \"e,\" present in his on-screen credit), which has absolutely no sense of pace whatsoever and seems to let every shot run at least half again as long as it needs to to make its dramatic point. it\\'s only a pity that someone didn\\'t do a mocking commentary on this movie now (in 2009); the comparison between steve alaimo\\'s hairdo and rod blagojevich\\'s would have been irresistible! spoilers: this movie has it\\'s problems, but in the end it gets the message across. i liked it because it ends the way things really do. the nice guy tries and tries, gets his heart broken several times, but in the end there is no typical hollywood ending. it ends the way such things always end, or at least always have in my own and friends\\' experiences. anyone who thinks that the ending to this isn\\'t how it really happens, as the first comment seemed to, believing that the girl would come around, realize she\\'s dating an asshole who treats her bad because he doesn\\'t care about her at all is either naive or lives in a more perfect world than i. i give it 7/10, extra points simply because it wasn\\'t afraid to end on a down note, give no real resolution, just the main character left heartbroken, confused and alone as so many men of countless generations have been before. thirty per cent of this movie appears to be the prototype for the map channel. you see a giant map for about ten minutes, then they unleash the stock footage big time while droning(droning, get it?)on about radar. apparently there\\'s a lot of radar stations in the far north, protecting north america\\'s borders from attacks by deadly polar bears. the bears never show up, but a giant mantis does. it was frozen in the ice for over a million years or so, until it was released by an earthquake somewhere else in the world(yeah, right. for my money, it was released by global warming). it is a huge prehistoric insect, and it needs lots of food. since there aren\\'t any cows in the frozen north, it decides to feast on the most bovine-like creatures it can find up there. i.e., human beings. it starts attacking radar stations, probably because the humming from the radar dishes was getting on its nerves. enter col. joe parkman, the resident smarmy guy of the film. he\\'s investigating a plane that went down, and is puzzled why there are no bodies in the wreckage. the only thing he finds is one of the claws of the mantis. apparently it decided to trim its nails while it was snacking on the plane\\'s crew. parkman takes the claw tip back with him to be analyzed by a thousand year old scientist. grandpa scientist can\\'t make heads or tails of the claw, mostly because he\\'s missed his naps so his mind isn\\'t functioning too well. so he calls in a smug paleontologist played by the guy who was the p.i. in perry mason. he and his friend, a transvestite photographer, fly north because he\\'s decided that the claw must have come from a praying mantis. just one the size of a commuter train. it\\'s luke warm love at first sight when col.parkman first sets eyes on the she-male photographer. the men at the base, obviously having been deprived for many years, think she\\'s the hottest thing to come along since granny clampett. smug science guy and smarmy soldier guy start working together to track the path of the mantis, which has devastated some stock footage of an eskimo village. it comes to the base looking for an after dinner snack, and crushes some cheap sets quite effectively. then it flies south and disappears. now comes the tense hours when the civilian ground observer core are called on to sweep the skies looking for anything large flying overhead. i doubt that in reality they would have been told that they were looking for a giant flying mantis that eats human beings, since that would haver caused a panic. probably they were told to look for a giant 727 that was painted green and hummed because its engine was out of tune. col. parkman goes up in a plane to try to shoot the mantis down, and botches the mission. the mantis lands in new york city, probably because it wanted to take in a show on broadway or visit sex world in times square. the army corners it in the tunnel, and parkman and his men don stupid suits that they borrowed from the orkin man to go in and try to blow the mantis up. success! well, almost, since the mantis is still twitching enough that it almost kills the mannish eve arden photographer lady. there\\'s a tepid love scene at the end, and the paleontologist takes a picture of the dead mantis because colonel hair grease and ms. gender unspecified are busy smooching. so kind of a nauseating ending. the dereks did seem to struggle to find rolls for bo after \"10\". i used to work for a marine park in the florida keys. one day, the script for \"ghosts can\\'t do it\" was circulating among the trainers in the \"fish house\" where food was prepared for the dolphins. there was one scene where a -dolphin- supposedly propositions bo (or bo the dolphin), asking to \"go make eggs.\" reading the script, we -lauuughed-... we did not end up doing any portion of this movie at our facility, although our dolphins -were- in \"the big blue!\" this must have been very close to the end of anthony quinn\\'s life. i hope he had fun in this film, as it certainly didn\\'t do anything for his legacy. uncompromising look at a suburb in 21st century vienna mixing the stories of six groups of characters by former documentary maker u.seidl is a provocative, minimalistic and intense piece of observation cinema. after the world-wide spread of big brother reality shows, hundstage takes modern voyeurism to an unsettling, profound level. hard to like but unignorable piece of european art-cinema might seem cruel and seedy, yet manages to convey the nihilistic alienated feeling of modern society in a praiseworthy manner. a must for lovers of world cinema. this is not a great movie as tho the cast (especially the kids) admirably help to carry along this very sad yet contrived plot it is filled with clichã© upon clichã©. poor family in 50\\'s mid america, dying mother, alcoholic father, 10 children (1 of whom has epilepsy) and an awful decision to be made. its very easy to watch and some of the kids performances are moving without being sickly or naff. and little frank and warrnen steal the show for me with the last scene leaving me bawling no matter how many times i see it. a great rainy afternoon movie i recommend to all. only those with the hardest of hearts could fail to be moved by it. not on a par to sophies choice but a good tv movie equivalent!!! i really hated this movie and it\\'s the first movie written by stephen king that i didn\\'t finish. i was truly disappointed, it was the worst crap i\\'ve ever seen. what were you thinking making three hours out of it? it may have a quite good story, but actors? no. suspense? no. romance? no. horror? no. it didn\\'t have anything. it\\'s got this strange, crazy science man with einstein-hair, the classic thing. not real at all. and a man keep getting younger all the time. it seems like they just used the name of stephen king to make a crappy, too long movie with nothing exciting at all. i give this movie \"1 (awful)\". if they had like -5, i would probably take that instead. it was a total waste of time. this is indeed the film that popularized kung fu in the 1970s. however, if it ever had any kind of excitement or even halfway interesting plot, it doesn\\'t seem to have aged very well. long story short: extremely drawn out, slow-moving, confusing plot with run-of-the-mill choreography, typically annoying and exaggerated whiplash sounds with every punch and kick, and constant \"plot twists\" that never come to an end. by the time the film reaches its emotional climax, i had long had all the wind knocked out of me to actually care. watch it for its historical value as a milestone of chinese kung fu cinema -- just leave your expectations at the door, or you\\'ll be bitterly disappointed. for hardcore fans only. this game is the bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and should be on greatest hits. when i got agent under fire, i thought that was a good game but then nightfire came around and that was better, but now there is a new type of james bond game. this time it a 3rd person shooter and there is more than 12 missions, the graphics of the game are out of this house. it even has all of the great actors and actresses in this game like pierce bronsan as once again james bond, william dafoe as the villain nikolai diavolo, and judi dench as m (forgive me all if i spell it wrong). this game would be own as the greatest james bond game around. i give this a 10/10 the unflappable william powell. he is a joy to watch on the screen as he makes his way through situations without a care in the world. he always seems on top of his game and shows little care for anyone who doubts him. the murders are projects, barely human beings. i have noticed this is a staple of the whodunnit. other than an occasional weeping widow, the victims fulfill the function of being the reason the movie exists. nothing more. there are enough twists and turns to keep things interesting along the way and powell is a master at this. there is a lot of political incorrectness, especially as it relates to the asian performers. this is a little hard to take. the cast is great, and curtiz\\'s direction is also a consistent asset. what we have here is a downright brilliant piece of early 80\\'s incompetence that will render even the biggest connoisseur of trash- cinema completely speechless! \"wizards of the lost kingdom\" is a very cheap and cheesy fantasy/sword-and-sorcery adventure that doesn\\'t have an actual plot but does eagerly & shamelessly borrows elements from other films. writer ed naha and hector olivera (who?) watched enough similar type of movies to know that they needed a handful of essential characters, but probably figured that all the rest would follow automatically. in order to make a fantasy-adventure you need: one super- evil villain (preferably with a black cape), one young hero in training, one lone warrior, one amiable type of furry pet, one wise midget living in the woods (optional) and a whole colorful collection of hideous demons, enslaved dwarfs, and winged gargoyles to serve as filler. the story is phenomenal and so original, with simon the young son of a wizard having to flee from his beloved kingdom after the evil magician shurka takes over the power and killed the king. simon wants to go back and save the people, but therefore he needs his powerful ring which he lost during his escape. simon befriends lone warrior kor (the usually cool dude bo svenson who clearly needed the pay check), who assists simon during the long and devastating journey full of ordeals, dangerous encounters and magical showdowns. admittedly it doesn\\'t even sound too bad thus far, but that\\'s merely just because i excluded all the deliciously inept little details. simon has a best friend named gulfax, for example. gulfax is an albino version of chewbacca and evokes incontrollable chuckles whenever he opens his poodle-snout to yelp something incomprehensible. the obstacles during journey back home are hilariously irrelevant to the \"plot\" and simply serve as padding footage to cover up the lack of actual content. simon has nightmarish visions inside the tent of a suspicious forest nymph, kor settles an old score with the pig-faced nemesis whose sister he refused to marry and there\\'s the supposedly horrible \\'suicide cave\\' where you can only sing your way out of. but the absolute most unequally brilliant sequence â– not just of this film alone but in the history of cinema â– involves the resurrection of four zombie warriors. simon awakes the legendary courageous warriors, hoping they will assist them in their battle, but the rotting corpses only take a few steps, complain about how tired they are and return back to their graves. that\\'s it! so much for the zombie sub plot! best sequence ever! i could go on listing unintentionally hilarious little details for several more paragraphs, but you get the idea. \"wizards of the lost kingdom\" is a tremendously messed-up \"so-bad-it\\'s-good\" film. word of advice: do not watch this joyful piece of junk alone. invite friends, preferably the dope-headed types with a wicked sense of humor, and watch it in group. it will be a night to rememberâ… this is one of my favourite films, dating back to my childhood. set in the remote wilderness of siberia at the turn of the century, a small community is stirred when an extremely cold winter forces two tigers to come down from the mountains in search of food, preying on outlying farms. in this atmosphere we are introduced to avakum, a hermit fur trapper, who lives out in the wilds, as he comes to the village to sell his annual catch to boris, his close, and rather only, friend in the village, who runs a store. at boris\\' request, avakum accompanies his friend\\'s arrogant son, ivan, on the hunt for the menacing tigers. personalities crash and tempers flare as the older, more experienced avakum criticises ivan\\'s amateur methods, an encounter noticed also by the other members of the hunt. on the second day, the hunters sight their prey and give chase. in a thick wood, ivan wounds one of the tigers, which then attacks the hapless man. avakum, seeing ivan tangling with the enraged beast, fires, but accidently hits ivan. he kills the tiger as it flees. the other hunters arrive on the scene, suspicious. back in the village, the doctor works to save the wounded ivan. avakum attempts to leave the village, but is confronted by ivan\\'s friends. the trapper brushes them off however, and speeds off with his dog-drawn sled. the young villagers swear after him that they\\'ll come for him if ivan dies, which he later does, but before dying explains to his father that it was an accident. old boris, upon learning of his close friend being run out of the village, straightens out the gathering \"lynch mob\" and goes out after avakum, to find him and set things right. and so the main story begins. a simple film, it raises the conflict of man and civilisation versus nature, mainly avakum\\'s struggle to survive alone out in the wilderness. the winter landscape is very well filmed. perhaps the strongest element in the film is the soundtrack by jimmie haskell. very sentimental and evocative, the main theme reminiscent of albinoni\\'s adagio. other movements reflect russian styles, as well as a couple of folk music type tunes. unfortunately, this film is not available to buy, to my knowledge, which is rather a shame. the copy i own, recorded off tv nearly twenty years ago is slowly deteriorating. this film is a must see for those who can appreciate it, if they can find it. 8/10 i have a feeling that the warners bros depression-era musicals are going to become a lot more pertinent in the next couple of years. yes, we are in the economic doldrums (or have you been living under a rock) and times look bleak. but we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles. in the 30\\'s, film-going was hugely popular even at the height of economic gloom. \"footlight parade (1933)\" was one such film that audiences flocked to. while this lloyd bacon-directed musical doesn\\'t quite capture the social issues of the time as \"gold diggers of 1933 (1933)\" does, it\\'s still a wonderful showcase of talent. we have to wait until the end of the film for the three centrepiece busby berkely extravaganza numbers, but boy, are they worth waiting for me. yes, little ruby keeler is a terrible singer and actress, and her tapping is so-so, but busby\\'s magical \"by a waterfall\" whisks her, and what seems to be a hundred other chorus girls, into a dizzying water wonderland. of course busby\\'s numbers could never really be performed on a stage (they defy limits of gravity, for one thing), and they contrast terrifically with the realism of the tough, wisecracking non-musical scenes. and \"footlight\" also has james cagney in at the one of his all-too-few musicals (really, what couldn\\'t this man do?). he even gets to take over from the leading man, don sailor garb and fawn over sexpot shanghai lil (who is really little ruby in china-girl wig!).he co-stars with joan blondell, his adorable, adoring secretary who cagney somehow overlooks in favour of other women (until the final reel, that is). apparently blondell was the only other woman who cagney loved apart from his wife. and you can see the mutual adoration in every scene. this is a novelty in danish film. the mood is not unlike that of blinkende lygter, also by anders thomas jensen, but with a novel touch. one difference is fewer characters, leaving much more room for them to be dwelled into. and what characters?! the two butchers are perfect. mads mikkelsen is a dominating, deranged parody and nikolaj lie kaas an indifferent looser with a twin brother more or less an unholy pairing of the two. first of all this is one of the worst soft-core straight to cable \"erotic thriller\" i\\'ve ever seen in my life. of course, like all erotic thrillers are want to do, it\\'s about a brothel madam and is set in a brothel. this, of course, makes the softcore simulated sex that pops up every other 10 minutes seem \"in context.\" whatever. forget for one moment that this was never meant to win any awards. the actors are terrible and their line reading made me cringe. the woman who plays the female cop is so bad it\\'s beyond description. she must be a really really good friend of the guys who put up the movie for this terrible adventure, if you know what i mean. the production values are only slightly higher than porn. other than that? i suppose if you\\'re really drunk and you need something to laugh at, this would be a perfect film. and if that\\'s the case, i recommend fast forwarding to all the scenes with the female cop. what\\'s that accent, brooklyn? hilarious! beforehand notification: i\\'m sure someone is going to accuse me of playing the race card here, but when i saw the preview for this movie, i was thinking \"finally!\" i have yet to see one movie about popular african-influenced dance (be it popular hip hop moves, breaking, or stepping) where the main character was a black woman. i\\'ve seen an excessive amount of movies where a non-black woman who knew nothing about hip hop comes fresh to the hood and does a mediocre job of it (breakin, breakin 2, save the last dance, step up), but the black women in the film are almost nonexistent. that always bothered me considering so much of hip hop, african-influenced dance, and breaking was with blacks and latinos in massive amounts in these particular sets and it wasn\\'t always men who performed it, so i felt this movie has been a long time coming. however, the race does not make the film, so i also wanted it to carry a believable plot; the dancing be entertaining; and interesting to watch. pros: i really enjoyed this film bringing jamaican culture. i can\\'t recall ever seeing a popular, mainstream film where all the main characters were jamaican; had believable accents; and weren\\'t stereotypical with the beanies. the steppers, family, friends, and even the \"thugs\" were all really intelligent, realistic people who were trying to love, live, and survive in the neighborhood they lived in by doing something positive. even when the audience was made aware that the main character\\'s sister chose an alternate lifestyle, it still didn\\'t make the plot stereotypical. i was satisfied with the way it was portrayed. i loved the stepping; the romantic flirty relationship going on between two steppers; the trials that the main character\\'s parents were going through; and how she dealt with coming back to her old neighborhood and dealing with crabs in a barrel. i respected that she was so intelligent and active at the same time, and so many other sistas in the film were handling themselves in the step world. they were all just as excellent as the fellas. i don\\'t see that in too many movies nowadays, at least not those that would be considered black films. cons: i\\'m not quite sure why the directors or whoever put the movie together did this, but i question whether they\\'ve been to real step shows. whenever the steppers got ready to perform, some hip hop song would play in place of the steppers\\' hand/feet beats. at a real step show, there is zero need for music, other than to maybe entertain the crowds in between groups. and then when hip hop songs were played, sometimes the beat to the song was off to the beat of the steppers\\' hands and feet. it was awkward. i was more impressed with the stepping in this movie versus \"stomp the yard\" (another great stepping movie) because the women got to represent as fierce as the guys (in \"stomp the yard,\" meagan good got all of a few seconds of some prissy twirl and hair flip and the (deltas?) let out a chant and a few steps and were cut immediately). even when there were very small scenes, the ladies tore it up, especially in the auto shop, and it was without all that music to drown out their physical music. i know soundtracks have to be sold, but the movie folks could\\'ve played the music in other parts of the film. i\\'m not a keyshia cole fan, so every time i saw her, all i kept thinking was \"is it written in the script for her to constantly put her hand on her hip when she talks?\" she looked uncomfortable on screen to me. i thought they should\\'ve used a host like free or rocsi instead. deray davis was funny as usual though. also, i groaned when i found out that the movie was supposed to be in the ghetto, like stepping couldn\\'t possibly happen anywhere else. hollywood, as usual. however, only a couple of people were portrayed as excessively ignorant due to their neighborhood and losers, which mainstream movies tend to do. i would\\'ve given this movie five stars, but the music playing killed it for me. i definitely plan to buy it when it comes out and hopefully the bonus scenes will include the actual step shows without all the songs. it\\'s the worst movie i\\'ve ever seen. the action is so unclear, work of cameras is so poor, actors are so affected ... and this lamentable 5 minutes of arnie on the screen. my advice from the bottom of my heart - don\\'t watch it unless you like such a low class torture. excellent writing and wild cast. the tech is poor but it\\'s obviously very low budget. looks like they didn\\'t cut the negative but had to release on a video output. in any case one of the most inventive comedies i\\'ve seen lately. the screenwriter in particular is fine. contains major spoilers, on the off chance you would actually care about the story line. ok, we have storms that destroy a city and a computer hacker who clobbers the power grid. predictable schlock from the start, and if that weren\\'t enough, the 5 second action bumps between the movie and the commercials kill what little suspense there might have been. for example: will they make it to the airport in time? things look dim as we go to a commercialâ…and the action shot before the ad shows them bouncing around inside the plane! well, i guess they\\'re gonna make it after allâ…but then again, they had to because they\\'re good guys. the acting wasn\\'t any too impressive (exception and welcome relief: randy quaid as tornado tommy) , the effects were kinda lame, the bad guys got it, and the good guys came through. the real disaster of this movie was the script, especially the ending. not only did they wrap things up happily as quickly as a soap opera given 24 hours notice of a cancellation, but they glorified the hacker as well-intentioned. so he caused a bazillion deathsâ…he meant well. and, of course, an uplifting final tv report about people coming together. barf. it was everything i expected from the commercials, and i\\'m glad i wasted my time watching it. it will make great conversation at the lunch table tomorrow. is cbs insulting us by making this? sureâ…but we watched it, didn\\'t we? did you count many ads there were for home backup generators during this pig? here\\'s hoping for the next plan 9 from outer space (which gets better with each viewing). this isn\\'t it. 1 star. another indian legend you never heard of before is let loose. as the name implies, this is a vengeful wraith who likes to absorb the skeletons of people while they\\'re still using them. as usual, ancient burial grounds (can you say, \"poltergeist?\") have been disturbed by clichã©d greedy land developers building stuff. the cgi, if it had been better, might have made the effect more treacherous looking, but they skimped on the budget, and it shows--to comical effect. the unleashed creature probably should have been kept off stage during its first several killings-that might have added some mystery or impending doom atmosphere-but the inept director decided to show us in the first five minutes what it looks like, and it wasn\\'t impressive. the deaths are just poorly done, again with shoddy cgi. i guess ancient spirits always kill by using cheap special effects. as for the \"victims,\" they look they\\'re going to laugh any moment while they do goofy screams. it\\'s always obvious who\\'s going to get it: a character with only a few lines shows up, strange noises are heard, cgi dots fly, exit character. repeat (several times). still, there\\'s a few chase scenes featuring the monster that actually made this thing watchable. unfortunately, the director seems to be using these as a device to fall back on (so it\\'s used too often) when he can\\'t think of anything else for his characters to do. overall, it\\'s pretty silly, but i\\'ve seen worse. this flick is cheap, but it\\'s oddly fun to watch. when i really began to be interested in movies, at the age of eleven, i had a big list of \\'must see\\' films and i would go to blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend; some of them were not for all audiences and my mother would go nuts. i remember one of the films on that list was \"a chorus line\" and could never get it; so now to see it is a dream come true. of course, i lost the list and i would do anything to get it back because i think there were some really interesting things to watch there. i mean, take \"a chorus line\", a stage play turned into film. i know it\\'s something we see a lot nowadays, but back then it was a little different, apparently; and this film has something special. most of the musicals made movies today, take the chance the camera gives them for free, to create different sceneries and take the characters to different places; \"a chorus line\" was born on a theater stage as a play and it dies in the same place as a movie. following a big audition held by recognized choreographer zach (michael douglas), richard atenborough directs a big number of dancers as they try to get the job. everything happens on the same day: the tension of not knowing, the stress of having to learn the numbers, the silent competition between the dancersâ…and it all occurs on the stage, where douglas puts each dancer on the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal life and their most horrible experiences. there are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic, but they list shortens as the hours go by. like a movie i saw recently, \"a prairie home companion\", the broadcast of a radio show, atenborough here deals with the problem of continuity. on or behind the stage, things are going on, and time doesn\\'t seem to stop. again, i don\\'t if atenborough cut a lot to shoot this, but it sure doesn\\'t look like it; and anyway it\\'s a great directing and editing (john bloom) work. but in that little stage, what you wonder is what to do with the cameraâ…with only one setting, ronnie taylor\\'s cinematography finds the way, making close-ups to certain characters, zooming in and out, showing the stage from different perspective and also giving us a beautiful view of new york. in one crucial moment, douglas tells the ones that are left: \"before we start eliminating: you\\'re all terrific and i\\'d like to hire you all; but i can\\'t\". this made me think about reality shows today, where the only thing that counts is the singing or dancing talent and where the jury always says that exact words to the contestants before some of them are leaving (even when they are not good). it\\'s hard, you must imagine; at least here, where all of them really are terrific. to tell some of the stories, the characters use songs and, in one second, the stage takes a new life and it literally is \\'a dream come true\\'. the music by marvin hamlisch and the lyrics by edward kleban make the theater to film transition without flaws, showing these dancers\\' feelings and letting them do those wonderful choreographies by michael bennett. the book in the theater also becomes a flawless and very short screenplay by arnold schulman; which is very touching at times. so if it\\'s not with a song it will be with a word; but in \"a chorus line\", it\\'s impossible not to be moved. during one of the rehearsal breaks in the audition, cassie, a special dancer played by alyson reed, takes the stage to convince douglas character that she can do it. the words \"let me dance for you\" never sounded more honest and more beautifully put in music and lyrics. the movie follows the events of the novel \"cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni\"( could be translated as \"the most beloved among humans\" ), written by marin preda ( a very controversial book and movie), a novel which became something like the bible or the story of hamlet, very popular and hard to get, due to its satiric contents over the communist regime. it represents the drama of the intellectual man, the humanist, in a \"red\" world. a movie filled with passion, fear, sexuality, all the great ingredients for a great movie recipe.one of the greatest romanian movies,despite its psychological charge(after all, it is an european movie). if it weren\\'t for the editing out of curse words and a superimposed blur when one character give another the finger, it would be easy to mistake this low-budget snoozer for a sci-fi channel pilot. the plot about the government\\'s attempts to destroy a group of telekinetics it originally trained as military weapons ends ambiguously enough with the hero, himself gifted, in pursuit of a telekinetic survivor bent on revenge. alas, the movie is talky, boring, predictable and even devoid of interesting special effects. top-billed louis gossett, jr. has a minor role as the evil government bureaucrat who originated the program and now wants to eliminate all traces. he walks through the part and it is hard to understand why he bothered. other members of the cast do a decent job with a script that demands little. i have seen the running man several times as i am a stephen king fan and have all his movies but now it is even better because up until 2 days ago i didn\\'t know about this website and i didn\\'t realize that the paul michael glaser that was involved with this movie was the same paul michael glaser that i grow up watching on starsky and hutch television show. for me this is a pleasant surprise because i can\\'t tell you how many times i cried when starsky or hutch got hurt. the episode where starsky (kill starsky) almost died i cried so hard my dad had to turn away from the show. what to you expect of a kid at age 12. now, i intentionally look for films and programs involving paul or david soul and anything that stephen king has his hands on i\\'m so there!!!!!!!! just got to say happy birthday paul!!!!! a stuttering plot, uninteresting characters and sub-par (to say the least) dialogue plagues this tv production that could hardly have been interesting even with a billion dollar production budget. the characters aren\\'t believable, in their motives, actions or their professed occupations. the plot reads like a bad dungeons and dragons(tm) hack but with plasma rifles and force fields. there are severe continuity issues and the degree of pointless interaction between the characters has this author, at least, wincing. avoid it like the plague. watch any episode of dark angel and you will have better acting, dialogue and plot. yuck. yes, this movie is a real thief. it stole some shiny oscars from avatar just because politicians wanted another war-hero movie to boost the acceptance (support?) for the wars u.s. is still fighting today. i do not really want to go here into politics, but come on, this is more clear than the summer sky. hurt locker does not really have anything outstanding, no real plot at all. i really feel myself in the 50\\'s of hungary when the party told the people what to like and what not to like. the same propaganda movies were produced that time, only with the exception that those were black and white. even if we consider this title a reasonable piece of the \"u.s. wars are cool\" genre, you surely have much better movies to choose from. whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of film-making, it\\'s thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever. if you\\'re depressed already, this film will send you over the edge. if you\\'re feeling somewhat depressed, this film will be just one more thing in your life to feel bitter about. you\\'ll feel that it\\'s just your luck to have chosen to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of time. otherwise you might be able to make it through this film unscathed (i didn\\'t, btw), safe in the knowledge that your life is so much better than jim\\'s. then again you might consider that you have been fooling yourself, and that are in fact in a much worse situation than you\\'d previously realized. you might feel a bit annoyed at jim for bringing this to your attention. you may want to slap him around a bit with a wet fish. the sad truth is, much as i wanted to like this movie... i hated it. it took rather a long miserable road down the path of oblivion and then suddenly, for no reason whatsoever, looked back at itself and then stopped. jim does not have an epiphany, at least not one that is conveyed on screen. jim has a miserable life and a miserable set of options. he discovers nothing that one can relate to and fails to make any significant progress on his journey of self-discovery. of course no-one alive could write a happy ending to this movie. as others have said it\\'s no hollywood tale, it\\'s gritty and it\\'s real. it\\'s well made. life is quite a struggle at times. if anyone were to know \"the answer\", they do well to shout it from the rooftops. still, i feel cheated because this movie pretends to have something to say. you feel that it\\'s going to say something, that if you just suffer through a little more of it, it\\'ll have something to say. it\\'ll make you stop and think. it doesn\\'t. again, i do submit that this is a well crafted film. and therefore may be of value to a film student with a penchant for e.g. lighting techniques of the use of colour palettes. for the rest of us, it\\'s utterly miss-able. i have to admit to enjoying bad movies. i love them i watch all of them. horror especially. my friends and i all gather after a hard week at school and work, rent some crazy tapes, order a pizza and have a blast. one of the ones we got at hollywood video, was this one, zombie bloodbath. this one had a great box, so i was expecting less than usual. the story is about a housing project that is built over a nuclear facility that has had the above-ground layers bulldozed, and the other underground layers are simply covered up. the inhabitants of this neighborhood find the covered up facility when some kids fall into a hole inside a cave. this wakes up some zombies. from this point on, it\\'s chunk-city. the gore effects and action never stop until the end credits roll. ok, it\\'s not great art, but this one, with it\\'s in-joke dialogue and over-the-top gruesome stuff was our favorite of the evening. actually, it was one of the best \"party tapes\" i have ever had the pleasure of watching. and you could tell it was done on no money, with a bunch of crazy people. there are hundreds of zombies, and the director looks like brendan frazer (he has a cameo) and it is just a wild trip. during world war ii, two byelorussian (soviet russian) soldiers try to avoid being captured by occupying nazis, as they trudge through snowy terrain, searching for food and safety. if you happen not to like black-and-white \"foreign\" films, you may still enjoy \"voskhozhdeniye\" (retiled in english \"the ascent\"). director larisa shepitko paces the film extraordinarily well, despite its being a largely introspective piece of work. her untimely death, in a car accident, made this ms. shepitko\\'s final film, unfortunately. after the opening mission is declared, there doesn\\'t seem to be much that could happen in the snowy woods, but shepitko and a changing setting make it unexpectedly exciting. leading players vladimir gostyukhin (as the spiritually wounded \"rybak\") and boris plotnikov (as the physically wounded \\'sotnikov\") successfully avoid being crushed by the ever increasing symbolism. their allegorical performances, under shepitko\\'s sharp direction, provide a memorable and thought-provoking take on a familiar story. ******** voskhozhdeniye (4/2/77) larisa shepitko ~ vladimir gostyukhin, boris plotnikov, lyudmila polyakova, anatoli solonitsyn 1904. the north african nation of morocco is hanging onto a tenuous independence, as the various european powers - france, germany, britain, russia, spain, and now the united states - are vying for influence in the region. the sultan (marc zuber) is a weak puppet; his uncle, the bashaw (vladek sheybal), who is being manipulated by the french and germans, is the real power behind the throne. enter berber chieftan raisuli (sean connery), the leader of the rif tribe and \"the last of the barbary pirates\", who kidnaps an american missionary, eden pedecaris (candice bergen) and her two children and takes them hostage. back in the us, president theodore roosevelt (brian keith) threatens to go to war over the issue: \"pedecaris alive or raisuli dead!\" - seeing the issue as the perfect way to exercise his \"big stick\" diplomacy, though secretary of state john hay (john huston) is not so confident. however, the raisuli has less sinister plans for the pedecarises, who are more than capable of handling themselves in any event. john milius\\'s great historical film, based very loosely off of a true story (i.e. pedecaris was a middle-aged man), is a wonderful bit of escapism. it has some amazing action scenes, a witty, well-written script, a fine cast enjoying themselves with the material, and does not overstay its welcome like, say, \"pirates of the caribbean\" or the \"lord of the rings\" movies. it\\'s not really an \"epic\" film in the strictest sense, but it\\'s one of the best pure action movies ever made. while the historical context is shaky, the storyline is interesting, and as some reviewers point out, it is even more pertinent today than it was when made. as president roosevelt says, \"america is like a grizzly bear\" - fierce, strong, but a little blind and reckless at times. at the time of the film\\'s setting, america has just been propelled onto the world stage as superpower, following their resounding victory in the spanish-american war - and roosevelt seizes this incident as a way to prove america\\'s worth. in real life, it didn\\'t quite work out that way, but allegorically it works well. while written from a right-wing perspective, milius\\'s screenplay is pretty accurate in assessing america and its place in the world. he admires roosevelt and his method of \"big stick\" diplomacy, and correctly recognizes (in the words of roosevelt) that while america may be feared and respected, they\\'ll never be truly \"loved\" by the world, no matter what they do. and there are some scenes - like roosevelt\\'s target shooting of european leaders and the almost-comic surprise attack by marines on the bashaw\\'s palace - which show america\\'s reckless and violent side, while others - the climactic showdown with the germans - show their heroism. the historical/political context of the film is, of course, merely meat on the bones of what is essentially a rousing action/adventure film. there are some brilliantly done action scenes, such as raisuli\\'s rescue of the pedecaris\\'s from double-crossing tribesmen, which features some of the best swordplay in any film. the opening entrance of the raisuli and the aforementioned march and attack of the us marines are brilliantly done bravura set pieces. and the final battle, which combines elements of \"lawrence of arabia\" and \"the wild bunch\", while a major historical fantasy (a three-way battle between germans, americans, and the rifs), is a superbly staged, adrenaline-pumping sequence. the excellent cast gives some wonderful performances. everyone seems to be having a fun time with the film, and it shows. sean connery is surprisingly convincing as a berber with a scottish accent, but manages to pull off his interesting, well-drawn and chivalrous character who comes to respect his hostage and abhors modern, uncivil warfare. candice bergen, an actress whom i\\'ve never been fond of, gives a fine performance as the feisty eden pedecaris, who is every bit as tough as her captor. brian keith is an amazingly convincing tr - you really feel he must have been like this, an athletic, blustering, yet practical and intelligent man with an admirable sense of self. the scenes of roosevelt boxing and target-shooting while discussing foreign policy are some of the greatest \"bad ass\" moments in movie history - and who can forget lines like \"why spoil the beauty of the thing with legality?\" john huston provides solid support as the weary, cautious hay, acting as a perfect foil to the much more impetuous roosevelt. among the fine supporting cast, the best are geoffrey lewis as samuel gummere, the cynical ambassador caught in the middle of the political intrigue, and steve kanaly, as the gung-ho marine captain who cheerfully advocates (and carries out) \"military intervention!\" as the blunt and simple solution to the whole complex situation. other familiar faces such as vladek sheybal, nadim sawalha, roy jenson, larry cross, marc zuber, and darrell fetty also do fine work, no matter how small their role. spaghetti western fans will recognize antoine saint-john (\"a fistful of dynamite\") as the german general and aldo sambrell as one of raisuli\\'s tribesmen. \"the wind and the lion\" is, all around, a wonderfully done adventure film. it has something for everyone: wonderful gun- and swordplay, a lot of humor, a tough, feisty heroine (and her two cute children), a nice (if unconsummated) romance, and an interesting (if fanciful) political/historical context. it\\'s not a masterpiece, but hey, it wasn\\'t trying to be. i give \"the wind and the lion\" a stirring nine stars and my highest recommendation. gilmore girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm, wit, and charm. at age 16 lorelai gilmore gave birth to rory gilmore. she left her parents house and got a job. now, lorelai and rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. they are best friends. the girls have an extensive knowledge of movies, and tv shows, and are constantly quoting them. in the first season, lorelai needs money to send rory to chilton ( a very highly rated high school), so she reluctantly has to turn to her parents. they are happy to give them the money, but in exchange, rory has to come have dinner with them every friday night. i highly recommend this show. i love it! a found tape about 3? guys having fun torturing a woman in several inhuman ways. yeah, spoiler. first of all, the acting made this short not scary at all, the woman seemed to have orgasms, not suffering. some of the punishments were so ridiculous! what\\'s shocking about throwing some meat or spin her in a chair? if you are shooting a nonsense tape, at least make it good. the only part to remark is the end: the hammered hand and the pierced eye, the rest of the film is really poor. to end the boredom, the supposed story about the tape being investigated, extra bullshit. the biggest one that bugs the hell out of me is that they say zues takes dutch commands. but she is speaking german to him. the 2 languishes are completely different, its like saying \"well he takes french commands\" and start talking spanish. james belushi gives more the feeling of being a comedy actor not a detective in the slightest. the role just doesn\\'t fit him, even if its mend to be a comedy. to many stereotype/predicable stuff. typical comment or comebacks. if you don\\'t look at those things i think it could be a nice movie to watch if its ever on tv. but i wouldn\\'t suggesting renting it. where to start?? i think only three other films have led me to post a review on imdb, and all of those were positive. as for this..? mind-blowingly, hideously, tragically, embarrassingly, catastrophically, stupidly, irritatingly, completely and utterly beyond awful. i am stunned this got made, never mind given a theatrical release. i think i am literally in shock. i\\'m no \"snob\". i didn\\'t expect beautiful film-making or intense character-depth, but this is truly beyond a joke. we simply must demand more from the films we see. avoid. like the black death. nothing about this movie stands out as either being great or terrible. in the end, that is what kills it. the blandness is just not good. i can\\'t say i expected better from will smith, but i definitely did from kevin james of \"the king of queens\"-- but, hey, i\\'m getting used to saying that a lot lately. this film attempts to make its mark as a witty romantic comedy, but it never hits the bull\\'s-eye. in fact, it never hits *anywhere* within the target. the allergy scene is disturbing; the fact that kevin james can\\'t dance is something that wouldn\\'t exactly catch anybody off-guard, and is therefore (in a movie like this) not funny. this movie constantly tries to win your heart, but always with the wrong ploy at the wrong time. some parts are okay (but i\\'m searching my brain for examples), but i really think this movie should be avoided. quite unimpressive. the \\'twists\\' are all pretty predictable, if you\\'ve seen any movies within the last ten years, and the few somewhat interesting parts (wherein someone utilizes context clues to make a decision) are few and lack much punch, since the \\'secret\\' has already been shown before these clues are explained. (spoilers, sorta) the acting is decent enough. the story simply isn\\'t very interesting. the whole \\'still awake\\' premise becomes nullified by the astral projection stuff(not kidding). the surgery scene is initially tense, a bit discomforting, but then becomes utterly banal. not horrible, but not memorable. terrence howard\\'s least interesting role to date, so far as i\\'ve seen. kind of boring, overall. bad actors, terrible script, totally unbelievable ending - this film had it all. after seeing films like this, you wonder why the makers bothered at all. this film has absolutely nothing to say, all the methods used to create a scare have been used over and over again in previous horror films. a total waste of time. i can\\'t say i enjoyed this as much as \"the big lebowski\" or \"raising arizona,\" and felt a little slighted, but \"o brother\" is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the coens\\' brisk, twisted sense of creativity. the dvd edition contains the featurette, and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques. that surprised me! of course, this movie is not the best example (and i\\'m only saying this in comparison) and it wasn\\'t worthy of any oscars (many feel it was robbed), but maybe it depends on the appeal. though i enjoyed the coens\\' previous work, i\\'ve never been a fan of old westerns or \"the dukes of hazzard\" or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn. i guess that\\'s why i didn\\'t feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie, seeing that it revolves around southern folk. for all those from the south who are reading this, i don\\'t mean to offend any of your people! i\\'m sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like \"a bronx tale.\" when you live in the city all your life, it\\'s hard to get accustomed to films of this nature. but all apologies aside, i found the characters fun and quirky. i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly, and seeing the way he talks in real life i find that amazing. tim blake nelson was also good. of course, george clooney--who i assume is not the best at feigning accents, judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent for \"the perfect storm\"--naturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent. his performance was good, though. you can also spot coen regulars like holly hunter (in a short but sweet role) and john goodman (also on screen for a short time, but steals every minute of it). though i don\\'t normally dig country music, i liked the title song \"a man of constant sorrow.\" the dvd also contains the music video for that song. overall, i found the film entertaining and original, but it doesn\\'t have that in-your-face quality that the coens have shown to us in the past. it\\'s a slighter effort, but a good one. i still suggest you check it out. my score: 7 (out of 10) god, what an awful thing ! oliver stone probably wanted to experiment or something (see the terrible use of music and pictures here) but what for really ? the whole thing behind \"natural born killers\" seems to be a \"clever\" look at how medias can turn into complete trash but unfortunately the movie turns into trash itself. please mr. stone, next time you want to criticize the fascism of tv shows using violence to get high rates, avoid doing the same with your movie ! michael haneke said quite cleverly about this film that it was denouncing media fascism with fascist cinematographic ways. how true... only he forgot to tell us about the massive headache you get after sitting through this overlong load of crap ! stars: hayden pantierre. there have been so many movies that have this exact same plot, and this one is just a poor rehashing of it. populer white girl moves to ethnic school, doesn\\'t fit in, soon becomes accepted. originality is nonexistent in this, and neither are the laughs. it uses so many old poorly executed jokes it\\'s annoying. i don\\'t know why they think it\\'s a good idea to make made for video sequels to mediocre films, but it isn\\'t. with that said, the positives in this are that all the people in it are fairly competent actors and actresses. my rating: * out of ****. pg-13 for language and sexual humor. first, let\\'s get it out of the way. . . yeah, this film steals a lot from \\'darkness falls\\' (2003). the plot for \\'darkness falls\\' goes something like this: the tooth fairy, a murderous woman who hides her face due to disfigurement kills people who look at her out of revenge. in \\'the tooth fairy\\' (2006), the disfigured tooth fairy (who, yeah, hides her face) unleashes her furious vengeance on just about anyone. a little too similar to be coincidence. but, what must be asked is this: if you\\'re going to directly steal the exact plot from a movie, why choose something as mediocre as \\'darkness falls\\'? sure it made a few bucks at the box office, but that was strictly for the fairly okay theatrical experience the film delivered. a low-budget, straight-to-video movie will not have that same effect. and it didn\\'t. as i watched the opening 15-20 minutes of the film, my expectations actually rose. there seemed to be at least some production value. the story didn\\'t seem terrible, just blatantly ripped off. past the first scene, we get an okay cast of characters including an ex-doctor with secrets (played by that guy who looks like a busey) and some hot veterinary student (jenifer from argento\\'s \\'masters of horror: jenifer\\'). after those few minutes, however, the film just slowly goes down the drain. it serves all the basic horrible clichã©s including, but not limited to: some crazy old person with an unheeded warning, the buff dumb jock, the psychic, and the stripper with the heart-of-gold. one of the biggest problems this film had was its inability to stick with a target audience. it\\'s kind of like the filmmakers wanted to change the tone for whatever character was on screen at the time. when the adults were on screen, it had a more mature feel. when star (the stripper) and whatshisface (the jock) were on screen, the dialogue went down to a more stupid, err immature, level. when the kid was on screen, it felt like an episode of \\'are you afraid of the dark?\\'. . . only less scary. technically, the film is all over the place. the visuals range from fairly good to plain boring. the writing is subpar, as is the acting for the most part. on the plus side, there\\'s some excessive gore at parts (including a fairly cool (yet painfully predictable)) woodchipper scene and a pretty vicious nailgun scene. also, if you\\'re looking for a bit of the sexy stuff, there\\'s a brief topless scene (but if you want to see this chick topless, there are better films to do that). other than that, there\\'s not much to bother with when it comes to this film. if you\\'re a huge fan of \\'darkness falls\\' (do those exist?), maybe you can check it out to see the story done in a different way. . . but, that\\'s about the only reason i can find to see this one. final verdict: 3/10 -ap3- like those who listened to radio reports about the attack on pearl harbor, every one who has ever seen pink flamingos can tell you exactly where they were when they first saw it--and some thirty years later the movie is still one of the most unspeakably vile, obnoxious, repulsive, and hilariously funny films ever put to celluloid, guaranteed to test the strongest stomachs and the toughest funny bones. filmed with a close-to-zero budget and some of the shakiest cinematography around, pink flamingos tells the story of two families that compete for the tabloid title of \"the filthiest people alive.\" just how filthy can they be? plenty: the film includes everything from sex with chickens to what i can only describe as a remarkable display of rectal control to a heaping helping of doggie doo, and i guarantee that you won\\'t want to eat an egg for at least several weeks after seeing it. the cast is either wonderful, atrocious, or atrociously wonderful, depending on how you look at it. the star, of course, is divine... and to describe divine as the biggest drag queen on the planet would the understatement of the year. she is a mammoth creature given to big eye makeup, big orange hair, and big expressions--she is the charleton heston of drag, and whether she is almost running down a jogger, pausing to use the bathroom on some one\\'s front lawn, or startling real-life shoppers by taking a stroll along a baltimore sidewalk she is both unspeakable and unspeakably funny. others in the cast include mary vivian pearce, danny mills, and the ever-appalling edith massey as members of divine\\'s family; and mink stole and david lochary as the white-slaving, baby-selling couple who challenge divine\\'s status. it should be pretty obvious that pink flamingos is not exactly a movie that will appeal to just every one, and viewers who know director john waters only through such later films as hairspray and crybaby will be in for a major jolt. but if you want to see something so completely different that even monty python couldn\\'t imagine it, this is the movie for you. just make sure you eat before you see it, because you probably won\\'t want to eat afterward--and you might want to keep a barf bag handy just in case. gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer this is one of those movies where i just want to move my feet and dance around the house. it\\'s a very positive and happy type of music. the movie has some sad parts but mostly the music is what makes me happy. gary busey did a great job as buddy holly. buddy holly kept on going even tho his pastor, his parents and the nashville record producer told him no. buddy holly didn\\'t give up on what he liked. i didn\\'t know much about buddy holly until i watched this movie. i\\'ve been to the surf ballroom where he last played but didn\\'t give much attention to it until i watched this movie. it\\'s an incredible movie with lots of fun so get on your feet and see this movie. wow, what a great cast! julia roberts, john cusack, christopher walken, catherine zeta-jones, hank azaria...what\\'s that? a script, you say? now you\\'re just being greedy! surely such a charismatic bunch of thespians will weave such fetching tapestries of cinematic wonder that a script will be unnecessary? you\\'d think so, but no. america\\'s sweethearts is one missed opportunity after another. it\\'s like everyone involved woke up before each day\\'s writing/shooting/editing and though \"you know what? i\\'ve been working pretty hard lately, and this is guaranteed to be a hit with all these big names, right? i\\'m just gonna cruise along and let somebody else carry the can.\" so much potential, yet so painful to sit through. there isn\\'t a single aspect of this thing that doesn\\'t suck. even julia\\'s fat suit is lame. nice movie with a great soundtrack which spans through the rock landscape of the 70\\'s and 80\\'s. radiofreccia describes a generation, it describes life in a small village near correggio (hometown of ligabue, the singer who wrote the book that inspired the movie), it describes life of young people and their problems relating to the world. it reminds of trainspotting, with a bit of italian touch. i\\'d waited for some years before this movie finally got released in england, but was in many ways very pleased when i finally saw it. there are a lot of great things to the film, for a start the acting. its not something i have all that much need for in a horror picture but the people in this film all put in fine work. this and the constantly gripping and interesting script, with a nice sorta lovecraftian feel to it, give the film a real solid backbone. add to this the doses of surreal nightmare imagery and occasional gruesome gore and the films a winner. it has my favorite kind of gore too, supernatural and splattery. also, the characters of marcus, the angry bodybuilding transsexual and daisy, his mentally retarded lover/plaything are genuinely freakish and unnerving at times, and give a far out, anything goes sense of morbid grown up craziness which works well with the frequent freudian overtones. this is one of the most impressive recent horror movies, far more shocking or out there than anything hollywood can produce. my only gripe was that i wanted the ending to be darker in tone, but it still works, so on the whole i\\'d really recommend this to serious horror buffs. this movie has one or two slightly interesting gags but they are not worth the wait. after an unexplained argument between two guys picking up litter in a drive-in movie theatre we cut to a family leaving! hollywood and driving driving driving driving their camper van across the screen again and again as inane dialogue is voiced over. at least i think it\\'s inane, the terrible song that accompanies this montage is mixed so loud it renders the dialogue at times almost inaudible. finally the camper van arrives, at night, at a gas station where the family get out, have another inane conversation, before driving off. the camera then pans across to reveal the actor we have just seen drive away. he talks straight to camera and we realise he is the director of the movie we are watching which is about him, and how he came to make the movie. a nice idea which almost (but not quite) makes the previous sequences worth the pain. as the movie unfolds he encounters the two characters we met picking litter at the start of the movie and they all form a motion picture company. all sorts of not very funny and clumsy comedy ensues as they put together a crew and attempt to raise the cash needed to start filming. this movie was obviously put together on a shoe string and a promise and there is a nice little idea in here struggling to get out but the execution is so inept that the idea gets lost. comedy is more than things just falling over and everyone talking (or shouting) at once. so much of the dialogue here is shouted by several actors simultaneously - robert altman can do this sort of thing well because he has a script, rehearsals, decent sound techies, and editing facilities. everyone shouting at the one mike which, by the sound of it, was hidden in a dustbin in the next room, does not make for clarity. i can honestly tell you that this movie is the most awesome movie ever!!! if you are in the mood for a comedy, i totally recommend this movie! so, here\\'s the summary. there is this girl(nikki) who is fourteen and a half and she goes on a vacation with her father(andre) whom she hasn\\'t seen for about two years. she expects the vacation to be totally boring, until she meets this boy(ben), who is much older than she is. so, to try to impress him she says that she isn\\'t on vacation with her father, but her lover. this is a hysterical movie from beginning to end, and i highly suggest it. so rent it and enjoy!!! well here comes another,well,romantic comedy...but unlike all others movies of this genre,this is by far the best i have seen in a long while.. i\\'ll admit,at first i wanted to watch this movie because of megan fox,and a little because of simon pegg... first of all,if you have watched a decent amount of movies,you will know that sidney and alison would be together at the and of the movie,one way or another...but from the beginning to the end of the movie you won\\'t know how... okay,now this movie is just made for simon pegg.i can\\'t see any other actor in the role of sidney,and i\\'m sure this would be a very weaker movie if not for pegg\\'s great performance. there is a number of great gags and jokes in this movie that kept me laughing really hard,courtesy of simon pegg\\'s character sidney...but i think everyone in this movie is good.for example,kirsten dunst is really solid in this movie( i usually don\\'t think of her as any more than an average actress,but she was really good in this one ),then there\\'s jeff bridges,there\\'s gillian anderson,and of course megan fox who plays spoiled bitchy star sophie maes...great role for her... all in all,while i usually don\\'t agree with ratings her on imdb,this time i would completely agree with them... go and see this movie,it is really light-hearted and positive,and i recommend it deeply... my rating 7 out of 10...well 7.5 actually... with the advent of the imdb, this overlooked movie can now find an interested audience. why? because users here who do a search on two-time academy award winner glenda jackson can find \\'the return of the soldier\\' among her credits. so can those checking out oscar winner julie christie. fans of ann-margret can give the title a click, as will those looking into the career of the great alan bates. not to mention the added bonus of a movie with supporting heavyweights ian holm and frank finlay. any movie with so many notables in it is rewarded by the imdb, given all the cross-referencing that goes on here. so, why isn\\'t this movie out on dvd? don\\'t the producers realize the internet movie database is a marketing gift for such a film? and \\'the return of the soldier\\' is definitely a gem waiting to be discovered. get with it, people. [warning: contains spoilers] written by husband and wife wally wolodarsky (who also directed) and maya forbes, this indie film is one of the better romantic comedies in recent memory. jay mohr takes a break from playing smarmy weasels to be the nice guy faced with the fact his fiancã©e wants to bed other people and he\\'s allowed to do so, too. julianne nicholson, who was so good in \"tully,\" plays spunky and vulnerable with great gusto. too bad she doesn\\'t get the recognition she deserves. good supporting performances help immensely, too. lauren graham, who made last year\\'s \"bad santa\" memorable, plays the jaded, cynical sister to perfection, bryan cranston (the dad on tv\\'s \"malcolm in the middle\") gets a few funny, raunchy moments, and andy richter plays a genial guy who falls for a single mother - helen slater in a credible, albeit familiar, role as a mousy woman. what surprised me most about \"seeing other people\" was how funny it is. there are some genuine laughs here. ed\\'s first attempt at meaningless sex gets some great lines, and there\\'s a mã©nage a trois that elicits one of the most truthful reactions from a man as the male fantasy gets tweaked. the film\\'s premise isn\\'t unusual, but i liked that it was alice (nicholson) who thought of it, much to the chagrin of ed (mohr). given the genre, you know that no matter how good her intentions are, alice\\'s plan is doomed. we see how the couple works through this strange situation. initially, alice and ed are turned on by the idea, but then the human element sets it. i appreciated forbes and wolodarsky not turning this into a cheap sex romp. yes, there\\'s sex and nudity, but there also are real emotions at work here. the \"other people\" alice and ed befriend don\\'t want to be the objects of casual sex; they have feelings, too. in one case, too many feelings. granted, some scenes run one joke too many, the richter-slater subplot isn\\'t necessary and alice does something truly uncharacteristic. but that\\'s forgivable because mohr and nicholson generate such tremendous intimacy and honesty - check out the scenes where ed rummages through alice\\'s underwear drawer or his reaction to her announcement about ending the experiment - that no matter how much we might enjoy their little game, we root for this couple to succeed. unfortunately, this film got little, if any, publicity and a limited release. hollywood studios, whose romantic comedies often veer on the unfunny, turgid and unsurprising, would do well to learn from this intelligent and funny film. what a terrible movie! it represents perfectly the state of degenerateness of french society, where the most elementary respect for wholesome values and traditions has completely disappeared. the plot is nonsensical, the movie is not funny at all and the characters are completely shallow and uninteresting. to say the least, the direction and the cinematography are very poor and uninspired. catherine deneuve is as bad an actress as she always was, even when she was directed by bunuel in belle de jour. the rest of the usually good cast (vincent lindon, line renaud, jean yanne) seem completely lost in an ocean of vulgarity, platitudes and restlessness. i cannot help to draw a parallel with the wonderful james ivory\\'s \"le divorce\", with its thoughtful depiction of french and american mores, its superlative cinematography and stellar cast put to good use. having watched \"le divorce\" you can feel a kind of empathy with the french, regardless of their foibles. \"belle-maman\" leaves you with only a nauseated contempt for its morally bankrupt and clueless protagonists. this film\\'s kind of like conan the barabarian, but with more sex, rape and murder. there is a plot somewhere underneath all this debauchery but the filmmakers don\\'t do a good job showing it, which is a shame because it \\'could\\' be a decent story. richard hill gives a solid performance in the lead role, as does the villain - who sadly didn\\'t appear in anything else of note. the fight scenes aren\\'t too bad either - i love the way deathstalker lets his sword \\'drink\\' the blood of his victims - and there\\'s plenty of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo throughout. all in all, not good - but not necessarily that bad either... this may just be the most nostalgic journey back in time & through time to when one\\'s childhood starts a journey to reminiscences back & forth onwards & upwards,forwards & backwards,up & down & all around.the boy jimmy,h.r. puffinstuff,dr.blinky,cling & clang,ludicrous lion,& even the evil witchie poo too through & through. the latter day inspirations of lidsville,\"the brady kids saturday morning preview special\" sigmund & the sea monsters,and land of the lost both the new & old are what this very show bridged the gap to as well as the donny & marie show,the brady bunch variety hour a.k.a. brady bunch hour & even the paul lynde halloween special. maybe even other things in between & beyond the buck just keeps on moving on & on & even beyond expectations & as well as unexpected bounds.now as we get updated in march of \\'06 we know that jack wild\\'s gone & so now it make\\'s it even more symbolic for us to really get nostalgic.including now in august of \\'06 both when jack wild guest stars as himself on sigmund and the sea monsters as well as when on a latter episode h.r.puffinstuff does too and to recall all of the other nostalgic journeys of all the syd & marty kroft characters as well including the h.r.puffinstuff goodtime club;the donny and marie show;the brady bunch variety hour a.k.a. the brady bunch hour;etc. truthfully,stephen \"steve\" g. baer a.k.a. \"ste\" of framingham,ma.usa. the film had it moments, but was disappointing in my eyes anyway. it was a reworking of trespass (walter hill) and so the treasure of the sierra madre, with less tension, bite and human emotion. there was some nice acting but the story was limp and lacked any real depth. i watched the movie for mr reno and mr fishburn, neither were inspired and both had little to say or act out of their skin for. this movie has been done to death in the past and did not have to be made, eats up money which could be used on better movies. for an action movie it was sparse of action and as a thriller did not thrill. better than watching snow fall, but not for me. even mst3k couldn\\'t make this painful, long, and ultimately mind-bending drek funny or entertaining. while most bad movies in and of themselves are hilariously bad, this one is one of those few videos that uses the word bad in its literal sense. the element that makes this so painful to watch is not the lack of story, but the fact that soooo much background is crammed into the first half-hour that it is utterly ridiculous and harder to follow than a highway while driving with no headlights. the hero of the film, ator, is no more than eye-candy for this literal energy-sucker of a film. dressed in a loin-cloth and sporting \"pecs like melons,\" as joel put it, he belongs more in a fitness magazine than here. i would recommend this only to die-hard, and i mean die-hard followers of cheese. if you have an enemy, recommend them this film. if you make it through this, i commend you. you should be able to make it through anything. square really landed this one. they didn\\'t try to please everyone and instead focused exclusively on final fantasy 7 fans. and boy, are those going to be happy fans when they see this movie! the story might not be all that interesting or credible but it ties in neatly with the story of the game and has several honest-to-god funny moments!! a total surprise there and a welcome one too there are lots of cameos and funny references to the game too. and most important of all: the fighting scenes rock so hard they could cut through diamond! they are truly the total awesomeness and would have made the movie worth it even if everything else sucked. i mean, they are some of the best ever created period. see this movie. bye. ps: i know my review sounds like the ravings of a teenage girl. it was, like, totally what i intended. watching the wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts, unlike many other great ford films, like the searchers, my darling clementine, the man who shot liberty valance, and the grapes of wrath among others, but it is likely to produce a feeling of awe and deep satisfaction. the story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a wagon train of mormons get to california. along the way, they run into a medicine man whose mules ran away, a group of bank robbers, and some navajos. there\\'s a lot of adventure and excitement on the trail, and the film is imbued with fun and beauty. the music is absolutely beautiful. the scenery, again from monument valley, is as beautiful as it ever was. plus, how can you go wrong with james arness? the wagonmaster might not be one of john ford\\'s better known films, but it is nonetheless a must-see if you get the chance. 9/10. this was the most unrealistic movie i ever seen. i can\\'t believe that the writer and director didn\\'t see that almost all the movie looks like a sf one. for example: 1. it is impossible for the killer to stay on cold glaze and after 10 hours to get up so quickly. 2. you can\\'t get electrocuted trough a water pipe like in the movie.(believe me, it\\'s my domain) 3. with a saw you can cut 10 pipes in 10 hour very easy. let\\'s say that the chain was made from steel but the water pipe was rusty and it was made from iron. 4. if you try to cut your foot with a saw you faint (in the best case, it\\'s more likely to die because your hart fails) before to get to the bone(shin). and there are more other examples. a very great movie. a big love story. lots of sword fighting. huge battle scenes. heros and villains. real history. few in the west know much chinese history. chin zchaundi founded china. the country is in fact named after him. some are familiar with the terra cotta army recently unearthed. this is a historical epic of how he ended the period of contending states and unified china. he founded a dynasty that only last 14 years but it was immediately replaced by the han dynasty that permanently defined chinese civilization ever since. chin (or the king of zheng as he was known before he founded the empire)was roughly contemporaneous with scipio, hannibal, and fabius in the west. the parallel roman world dominance (west and east worlds) was achieved without a single towering personality like chin. it would not be for another century before the west produced caesar - the nearest comparable western figure. chin is shown very sympathetically here in the beginning but he develops over the course of the film into a ruthless despot. history only records the ruthless despot part but the sympathetic beginning leaves room for real character development over the course of this long film. the famous story about the meeting with the assassin is as true as any two thousand year old anecdote can be. gong li is lovely. she is the emotional core of the story. it all makes for great movie making. i saw this \"movie\" partly because of the sheer number of good reviews at netflix, and from it i leaned a valuable lesson. not a lesson about ethnic diversity however...the lesson i learned is \"don\\'t trust reviews\". yes, racism sucks and people are complicated, but the people who actually need to see this movie are going to be the ones who are the least drawn to it and least affected by it if they do see it. the only reason that i can think of for the number of good reviews is that it\\'s being reviewed by people who aren\\'t used to thinking, or who\\'ve seen their first thought-provoking movie and somehow think that haggis invented the concept. in fact, he basically made this film, which should be called \"racism for dummies\", as emotionally wrenching as possible, seemingly to give people who don\\'t spend a lot of time thinking the impression that they\\'ve discovered some fundamental truth that\\'s never been covered in a film before. zen and the art of motorcycle maintanence it\\'s not... an after-school special for the unthinking masses, cut into bite-sized overwrought ham-fisted pieces to make it easier to swallow without too much introspection. it\\'s as if they portrayed everyone as being the worst possible extreme, simply to make us happy that we\\'re such good people because we don\\'t identify with the characters. let\\'s face it people. nobody identifies with these characters because they\\'re all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes). it\\'s well acted (even if the dialog is atrocious) and cleverly executed, so much that you don\\'t think to ask \"where\\'s the beef?\" until you can tell the film is winding down. the flaming car scene was well executed, like much of the movie, but went nowhere in the end. the messages are very heavy-handed, and from the \"behind the scenes\" blurb, the producers were clearly watching a different movie, because there is very little to laugh about in this movie, even during the intended funny parts. i have to stress that this is not entertainment, more like a high school diversity lesson...call it the \"blood on the highway\" of racism. they could even show this in high schools if it weren\\'t for the \"side-nude\" shot of jennifer esposito. in this film, everyone\\'s a jerk and everyone learns a lesson (except for michael pena who gets the best role, but the most predictable storyline). this is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who can\\'t handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons. crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things. as a westerner watching another culture\\'s view and tradition of marriag, i found just married mesmerizing and delightful. the idea of marrying a stranger through the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult, especially in this modern age. yet this is the case in this hindi film. told with humor, and fresh perspective, we learn of abhay and ritika who have only met once and are now on their traditional five day honeymoon. as said, it is difficult to believe in this cell phone affluent age that such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage still take place. we see the awkwardness that this young couple feels as they come together on their first night, and how they try to forge a bond, even though they do not know one another. we see different views of marriage and commitment as presented by the other couples also on holiday, from a couple of forty years married to others still unsure of making marital commitment. there\\'s song, witty dialog, poignant moments, blending and comparison of new ways and tradition. watching the movie with subtitles definitely loses some of the trueness of the story, yet it is still a delight to watch. granted some of the plot is a little trite and the bus incident a bit drawn out and contrived; however the overall movie was worth watching. my nose is bent slightly out of shape as i write this. i had sent a previous comment on this film some weeks ago that has not yet appeared, so i assume it was rejected, even though it met all the usual guidelines. i found this film interesting for the first thirty minutes, particularly the performance of jordi mollã , a veteran actor who has appeared in such major productions as \"blow\" and \"the alamo.\" leonor watling is also quite good. unfortunately, everything sinks eventually under the weight of a truly awful, melodramatic script. there is also an abundance of gratuitous nudity that does nothing to advance the narrative or lend even an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed piece of art. an actual day trip to the beach at valencia would be much less arduous than having to encounter these fictional characters again anywhere, anytime. this is an interesting movie. i think it\\'s very humorous, although the humor is very black. fulci is good and funny acting himself, it\\'s a really funny and truly crazy \"self-portrait\" of an artist (\"i make horror films. if i would make love films, no-one would buy tickets...\"). and it\\'s really sexy movie also: almost all the time there is some \"action\" or tension going on; and many sexy girls/women... maybe it goes to the core of why anyone starts to do movies/art in the first place... it\\'s a real psychedelic trip, maybe best seen a little drunk or some similar state of mind. there is some really nasty gore scenes also, of course, because it\\'s lucio fulci. as a matter of fact some of those scenes are quite disgusting. anyway it\\'s one of the three best and most complete fulci films i\\'ve seen (the others are house by the cemetery & zombi.haven\\'t seen the beyond). actually, the script is overally, to my opinion, quite ingenious. you could see this movie as a portrait of an extreme neurotic, or a person who suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder (fashionable words): the character has a compulsive need to confess \"crimes\" or bad thoughts; especially crimes he hasn\\'t even done. and he questions himself all the time: what if i have done it? what if i want to do it? have i done it? do i want to do it? he overreacts and exaggerates his thoughts. i\\'m sure fulci has been interested of psychology, and maybe even read something of the area; in his \"house by the cemetery\"-movie for example there is a character named freudstein. this is maybe the most concentrated and straightly personal movie fulci did. i also like the simplicity of the photography/pictures in this film. only thing that disturbs me a little bit is the sadism, especially towards women; i don\\'t quite understand why? is it entertainment? is it art? is it horror? anyways and overall, this is really interesting and well made movie, definitely recommended classic film at least for fans or anyone interested of this genre. for the others it may be too much. i could not watch more than 10 minutes of this movie. it has set the standard. i will never again give a movie a 1, unless it was as horrible as this one. i fully agree with the other comments about this film. but, since i\\'m dutch, i watched it with dutch translation. apparently, they didn\\'t have money for a proper translation, so they decided to babelfish it. with sometimes hilarious results. don\\'t smoke, don\\'t drink, don\\'t do drugs, don\\'t watch demon summer. i was surprised that the actors (wow, i can\\'t believe i just said that.) didn\\'t hold the script (was there any?) in their hands while shooting. i think they also did a good job on... well... uhmm... no, they didn\\'t do a good job at all. okay,i had watched this movie when i was very little and the day that we were cleaning out the closet i see this!i thought,\"i have no idea of what this movie was like,\"so i went ahead and put it in.oh my god!!!!!this film is so darn bad!i never thought that this film could ever get as close to my least favorite film as it did,but i did laugh,because all the jokes were so corny and ridiculous,not funny!!!!so much stuff in this movie was funny,because it was so stupid!!!!this film is not anywhere near good.i would have to say if you want to watch this movie you definitely better not expect anything big and if you\\'ve already seen it,trust me,i feel your pain as well!!!! i hadn\\'t planned on seeing this movie, however i wasn\\'t disappointed when a friend dragged me along. although there are no real surprises here, the guys do reasonably well with their obviously modest budget. if you\\'ve seen the trailer you probably know what to expect from this type of movie and there\\'s a pretty constant stream of jokes here, with a couple of classic moments, with the highpoint probably being an excellent flashback to what the guys were like in the 1980\\'s. also, i\\'ve read elsewhere that the ending was a disappointment, but i found it refreshingly different from what i had expected from this genre. overall, this movie wont change your life, but it\\'s got enough laughs there to keep you entertained throughout. yeah, that about sums it up. this movie was horrifying. two minutes in i wanted to gouge my eyes out. this has been praised as an \"innovative lds comedy,\" but it\\'s not even good for members of that church! i don\\'t think any human being should be so victimized as to watch a movie of this low quality. first of all, you can tell that absolutely no effort whatsoever went into this movie. it seems as if the horribly drab, glib, trite plot was thrown together by two crazy weasels somehow imbued with the gift for coherent (at least semi-coherent) thought. then, there\\'s the acting, which is dismal from *everybody* involved. even the cameos fail to liven anything up. and let\\'s not forget the fact that our protagonist is a shallow jerk who we would like to believe can change, but that road is full of embarrassingly bad dialogue, appallingly hideous \"gags,\" and a lot of mormon \"in-jokes\" that anyone in their right mind, lds or not, should consider purely *stupid*! this has to be one of the worst films i\\'ve ever seen! infamous horror films seldom measure up the hype that surrounds them and i have yet to come across a worse offender than wes craven\\'s the hills have eyes. having held back from watching this for years, i was really pleased when i got it for christmas and waited for an evening when my girlfriend was out to settle down and watch it - knowing her extreme dislike for anything genuinely horrifying. i needn\\'t have bothered. after a promising - if familiar - start, that firmly sets the film in the \\'desolution usa\\' world of survival horror, things rapidly go to pieces when the protagonists and antagonists meet in the deserted wasteland. looking like it was shot on a budget of $5, with the cannibal clan\\'s costumes hired from a dodgy fancy dress shop that specialises in faux caveman and red indian attire, the story follows an annoying bunch of unsympathetic wasps who take a detour on a road trip to california, to look for a silver mine in a nuclear testing zone (!). when they break down they are set upon by the local family of flesh-eaters and have to fight to survive. while hoping for another deliverance, texas chainsaw massacre, wrong turn or devil\\'s rejects, i actually realised i\\'d stumbled across something that should have remained dusty and unwatched in a backstreet video store\\'s bargain bin. with gallons of tomato ketchup for blood and a couple of gruesome wound close-ups, i can kind of see how an 18 certificate (in the uk) is justified, but with those close-ups trimmed this wouldn\\'t have looked out of place as a saturday afternoon thriller on itv. the whole silver mine/nuclear test site subplot is just a mcguffin to justify pitching the \\'civilised\\' family against the primitives, but given how easily the savages get their asses whupped it stretches credibility to think that they had survived for a generation preying on passers-by. and then there\\'s the ending ... or lack thereof. the hills have eyes seems to be missing either a third act or, at the very least, a satisfying denouement. instead, i was just left wondering: \"yeah, and ... ?\" although at first glance this movie looks like the story of your parent\\'s high school life (and many people will try to tell you that this movie is way outdated)... and i admit that that was my first impression.... but honestly,the \\'lessons\\' that are learned by the heroes/heroines are def. not outdated. who doesn\\'t want to be famous? and who doesn\\'t want do be accepted my their peers? and the homosexual guy-isn\\'t there a whole controversy today about gay marriage, blah, blah? this movie, though released in the 80\\'s still addresses some of the biggest issues in today\\'s world. this movie does have a little too much profanity and nudity for my taste, though. (thus the 8/10 rating) there are not many films which i would describe as perfect, but rififi definitely fits the bill. no other heist film has come close to it, before or after. the plot is simple, but engrosses you. it never ceases to amaze me how absolutely gripping the film is every time you view it. you care for all the characters, even though they are bank robbers, because they are presented as human beings with all their problems and flaws. it\\'s hard to imagine any other actor besides jean servais in the role of tony le stã©phanois. when the members of the crew are each talking about what they are going to do with their money and finally get to tony, his answer and the expression on his face says it all. while the 30 minute heist sequence is the most famous part of the movie(and rightfully so)the film actually gets better afterward.the director jules dassin knew what he was doing when he decided to not have any music during the heist scene or the final shootout, but instead inserted a great climactic score during tony\\'s final ride towards his destiny. to think that if dassin, an american director, had not been blacklisted in hollywood and forced to work in france, this masterpiece of cinema would never have been made the way it was. it certainly wouldn\\'t have been as good if it was made as an american film during that time. it was absolutely horrible what dassin had to go through, but he did achieve his greatest work because of it, to the benefit of all of us. i\\'m just cringing at the thought of the upcoming al pacino remake. most heist films since rififi have already borrowed from it in some way or another. there\\'s no reason to remake this masterpiece other than money. leave the classics alone! soul calibur has always been my favorite fighting game series of all time. and sciii is my favorite one of the series. the graphics are very well done. much bigger improvement over the choppy polygons in soul edge/soul blade. the characters have facial expressions, hair blows in the breeze and they even blink. soul calibur has always been known for it\\'s interesting plots and characters and sciii is no exception. each character has his/her background story that is detailed and well done. my favorite character is chai xianghua. she\\'s cute, she\\'s funny and she\\'s a strong female character. yeah, i know she wears pink and has a boyfriend (who she ends up saving btw), but there seems to be more to her than that. xianghua, like all the other characters, have flaws and upsides to their personalities, so no character is perfect, not even the good guys. the music is beautifully composed for a fighting game series. it doesn\\'t sound kitchy (the vampire series) nor does it sound like old school porn film soundtrack (mortal kombat). the characters have their own themes and a lot of the themes are done to match the culture of that certain part of the world. i don\\'t think there is a song on this soundtrack i don\\'t like. another cool thing about this game is to create your own anime-like character (create a soul). you could make him/her look as cute or as sexy or even ugly if you like. however, if you found a character customization that you like, remember to take notes, or else you won\\'t remember how you created that character. i found myself being very addicted to cas. overall, i think soul calibur is my number one fighting game series of all time. it has everything i asked for. what more could i want? yes, i know that this movie is meant as a comedy! and the humor is over the top! but the theme about people getting less intelligent in future time might not be so far fetched! i cannot say that it will happen,but if we don\\'t take proper care of our educational system than this could be a possibility! i have noticed that some schools aren\\'t teaching facts anymore! (like history,geography,basic stuff). the focus is more on learning practical abilities! the theory behind most subjects may be boring but is essential in understanding how things work! in the movie there is this ridiculous example of people growing crops with gatorade in stead of water! well,we can laugh about it! but if you never been taught that water contains minerals necessary for plants to grow so how would you know! to me this is a scary notion! so now you understand why this subject isn\\'t funny anymore! it could be that mike judge is making fun but at the same time is warning people for a real disaster if education doesn\\'t improve fast! am i taking this movie too seriously! yes of course! to each his own fun! i loved mike judge\\'s work (beavis and butthead and office space)! in these he was able to be critical and funny at the same time! in \"idiocracy\" i missed this! most of the events are too absurd and as i said earlier very scary! i do think if you are in the mood you will like this movie! the original animated dark knight returns in this ace adventure movie that rivals mask of phantasm in its coolness. there\\'s a lot of style and intelligence in mystery of the batwoman, so much more than batman forever or batman and robin. there\\'s a new crime-fighter on the streets of gotham. she dresses like a bat but she\\'s not a grown-up batgirl. and batman is denying any affiliation with her. meanwhile bruce wayne has to deal with the usual romances and detective work. but the penguin, bain and the local mob makes things little more complicated. i didn\\'t have high hopes for this \\'un since being strongly let down but the weak batman: sub zero (robin isn\\'t featured so much here!)but i was delighted with the imaginative and exciting set pieces, the clever plot and a cheeky sense of humor. this is definitely a movie no fan of batman should be without. keep your ears open for a really catchy song called \\'betcha neva\\' which is featured prominently through-out. it\\'s a shame the dvd isn\\'t so great. don\\'t get me wrong there are some great features (the short \\'chase me\\' is awesome) and a very cool dolby 5.1 soundtrack but... the movie is presented in pan and scan. batman: mystery of the batwoman was drawn and shot in 1.85:1 but this dvd is presented in 1.33:1 an in comparison to the widescreen clips shown on the features there is picture cut off on both sides. i find this extremely annoying considering mask of phantasm was presented in anamorphic widescreen. warner have had to re-release literally dozens of movies on dvd because people have complained about the lack of original aspect ratio available on some titles. why they chose to make that same mistake here again is beyond me. i would give this dvd 5/5 but the lack of oar brings the overall score down to 4/5. it\\'s a shame because widescreen would have completed a great dvd package. if you asked me to pick the best acted movies ever made, this movie would be on a short list along with 1951\\'s streetcar named desire. i imagine i\\'ll discover some others that qualify, but kramer vs kramer is an outstanding exercise in naturalism. so its a very satisfying experience on that level: just watching the marvelous, probing performances of dustin hoffman, meryl streep and the child justin henry in particular. one of the best child performances ever. but i also find it very satisfying to watch, because its such a thoroughly involving story - it always makes me forget my own problems. it has such excellent narrative drive. once you stick kramer vs kramer on, and alice kramer leaves ted to juggle work and their young son, telling him nothing more than she has to discover herself - you keep watching to know that everything turns out okay for them. and even once you know how things do turn out, each moment of the ride just rings so brilliantly true that its a joy to watch it happen again and again. make no mistake - kramer vs kramer is not light entertainment: its a very realistic portrayal of the effects of divorce on everyone involved. 10/10. for one of the best scripts (born out of conversations between benton and hoffman, who was going through a divorce at the time) ever written, executed and performed beautifully and faultlessly. not to mention what a great, involving story it is. put simply, a perfect film. let me say at the outset that i\\'m not a very artistic person and that i don\\'t \"get\" new art. that being said, this film is absolutely crazy, and in my opinion not crazy in a good way. filmed entirely in black and white with a series of very loosely connected stories, avida is a film for those who can look at modern art and say \"wow, i feel the energy and passion of this painting.\" the only reason i give this film a 3 out of 10 is because i actually did manage to laugh at some parts, though mainly laughing at the sheer insanity of the film. two of the characters throwing chairs on a lawn, as to do what these characters were doing, i have no idea. i wouldn\\'t recommend this film to anybody. wonderful film that mixes documentary and fiction in a way that makes the spectator question: what is the extent of truth in documentary films or is there such a thing as an objective documentary. it has been some years since i saw this, but remember it and would like to see it again. it kind of became a \"therapy\" for me with a personal experience of my own. a thirty-five year old man laments over a high-school baseball game in which he \"missed the ball\" and his team lost. he thinks about it 20 years later, \"if only i\\'d hit that ball\" and how his life would be better because of it. then, he gets a chance to find out....and gets a little more than he bargained for. it reminds me so much of when i was in high school, i twice tried out for our drill/dance team and didn\\'t make it. this team was the closest thing to a sorority in my school. if you were on it, you were \"all that.\" i didn\\'t try out till my last two years of hs and after the second time, i took it really hard. i\\'d hit and bruised my leg badly just before tryouts and wore tights to cover the bruise, and that caused me to not make it. that was in 1987. through the years, even now sometimes, i think \"if only i hadn\\'t hit my leg i would\\'ve never worn those stupid tights.\" now i don\\'t sit and think my life would be any better or even any different had i made it, but seeing this movie made me realize that we never really know how different things may be by changing one little thing way back in the past. who knows, it could have changed the course of events to the point that i wouldn\\'t have met my son\\'s father. i would recommend this movie to anyone who has that one moment in the past they wish they could change. be careful what you wish for!!! not really a big box office draw, but i was pleasently surprised with this movie. james \"i did some things to farrah fawcett\" orr co-wrote and directed this movie about an ordinary, average guy named larry burrows who thinks his life would have been incredibly different if he hit a homerun at a key baseball game when he was 15. but thanks to mysterious and magical bartender mike, larry gets his wish, yet soon realizes that his new life isn\\'t exactly as he hoped it would be. i must say, this movie really impressed me. critics have given it mixed, and i must say the concept is really interesting and pulled off well. yes, it is a little standard, but packs enough funny moments, drama and excellent acting to make it really good. james belushi (i think) was oscar worthy for his role. jon lovitz is perfect, and linda hamilton plus renee russo shine in their roles. michael caine is perfect as the bartender. it\\'s just a good movie with a good lesson. if you\\'ve never seen, i highly recommend you check this is another sci-fi channel original movie staring rhys davies where its hard to decide whats worse, the acting, or the writing/directing/producing (john sheppherd helms all three.)basic story: obsessed exobiologist captures chubacabra monster,smuggles it in a cargo container aboard a cruise ship it escapes and the blood bath begins. clichã©d sci fi cast of the sturdy captain with the beautiful daughter, handsome hero and mad scientist. captian calls in a terrorist alert for the ship (since of course wouldn\\'t believe a monster story.)no dramatic helicopter drop of the navy seals here. budget only allowed for entire force force of eight seals to arrive in a fiberglass fishing boat and ride a ships wench aboard. puleeze. also cheesy computer animation of the ship you could do better on your computer. i also loved when the seal commander looking thru standard binoculars from ten miles away was able to see three people jump of the ship. if the sci-fi channel is going to continue original movies i hope they realize there audience is not kindergarten level and purchase better scripts and directors. if this were direct to video you would find it in the 99 cent bin. and that goes especially for lawyers & cops. puerto rico,which boasts of a small,but potent film production firm,brings this multi layered tale of corruption,due to the on going drug cartel that starts in south america,makes a pit stop on the island commonwealth,and then northbound into north america. steven bauer,the most recognizable face on screen here,leads a cast of top notch actors,in a story of \"can you spot the only respectable face in the crowd?\". ricardo mendez matta moves up from directing mainly action adventure fare for american television,in a screenplay written by matta,along with poli marichal. the rest of the cast (elpidia carrillo,magda rivera,jose herredia,luz maria randon,to mention a few)turn in oh so fine roles,in a film that will keep you wondering \"is there any respectable characters here?\". spoken in spanish with english subtitles. rated \\'r\\' by the mpaa,this film contains outbursts of vulgar language,brief flashes of nudity,adult content & violence,some of which is quite lurid. in a lot of ways this film defines the essence of everything i love about cinema, in terms of capturing those strange, elusive moments of unguarded truth. in other ways, it is undeniably an amateurish, unfocused result of junkies self-indulgently fooling around with a camera. ultimately it comes out somewhere between pure brilliance and unwatchability (thankfully much more so the former than the latter). part of me wants to reward it solely for it\\'s absolute innovativeness and moments of pure sublimity, but at the same time i can\\'t completely ignore the occasionally downright awful \"acting\" and overtly bad production values. at first the editing seems overwhelmingly sloppy and needlessly distracting (or maybe just wrongheadedly \"innovative\"), but after a while i got used to it, which is, in the end, the true sign of whether a film succeeds on it\\'s own terms or not. i guess that answer basically sums up my all-around feelings for the film. that is, despite it\\'s in-ignorable flaws, on a whole it does work very well. and, if nothing else, a film like this really shows how false and contrived the faux-documentary, shaky-cam style can sometimes be when it so obviously applied purely for effect (such as in films like the otherwise admirable roger dodger). here the aesthetics are plainly derived from the necessities of the filming situation, and are not just used arbitrarily to make it look \"cool\". children love dinosaurs. it\\'s somewhat part of their culture. but they\\'ve got the land before time. the original. at least that movie had heart. this. this movie is just plain pathetic. just because kids love dinosaurs doesn\\'t mean you can just slap together any old story and show it to the children. this movie has no plot, the whole premise is stupid, and it\\'s more by the numbers stuff. not as soul sucking as theodore rex, but it\\'s lightyears away from being a land before time. last week i watched a royal shakespeare company production of macbeth. it was 25 years old, filmed w/no props except swords, no furniture except chairs. it was riveting. the acting was super - all the actors trained brits. contrast that performance to this...yawn yawn yawn. al pacino, as shylock, was tragic, heavy, and couldn\\'t quite lose the new yorker accent, despite the long....pauses....between.....lines.... the whole thing was soporific, even the \"comic\" scenes were barely even worth a smile, let a lone a belly laugh. this is supposed to be funny. they tried to make it tragic. it was neither, just boring. i give it four points for costumes, scenery, and jeremy irons, who is good at playing a dull, depressed, deep-voiced guy (can he be anything else???) i just love this film it totally rocks! nicolas cage looks hot and tommy does not! i definitely feel that fred and randy should have had a little more time together on screen cause they\\'re totally cool. my favorite part is when he says \"peter piper picked a pepper i guess i did!\" in the first transformation scene, what is the music? i\\'ve heard it was \"the greeks don\\'t get no freeks\". is that right? i really liked that sound. i also liked the \"hyde\\'s got nothing to hide\" in the final scenes. truly a doper movie, but with many laughs and puns, sight gags, and slapstick. madam woo-woo\\'s place was reminiscent of some places i have visited myself. ivy venus has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing. she looks much different in the movie we\\'re talking about, but her maturity didn\\'t hurt her a bit. mark blankfield reminds one of gene wilder in some ways. bess armstrong was beautiful and maintained her beauty for a long time. i\\'ve seen this movie quite a few times and each time i watch it, the quirkier and funnier it becomes. perhaps its the lack of research that went into nicolas cage\\'s character\\'s \\'punk\\' persona or just the cheesiness factor because it was such a typical eighties film...nonetheless it\\'s a cute love story with extremely funny, unique characters. i think it\\'s right up there with \"fast times\" and \"weird science\" (quintessential eighties flicks!) watching this i mainly noticed the ad placements. dhl, aquawhite strips, rockstar and more. it\\'s one product placement after another. it\\'s quite obvious how this movie got its funding. jessica simpson\\'s \"acting\" is laughable. any dick shouldn\\'t ever get work because he plays the same lame character. the \"story\" is just a backdrop for this very long commercial. i can\\'t believe this movie was even considered for theatrical release. the longer you watch this movie the more you\\'re embarrassed for everyone involved. the only minor saving grace is larry miller and rachael lee cook, who gets almost no screen time as jessica\\'s cousin. i\\'m embarrassed i watched the whole thing. i would recommend avoiding this one. i\\'m not tired to say this is one of the best political thrillers ever made. the story takes place in a fictional state, but obviously it deals with the murder of kennedy. a truthful and honest district attorney (played by yves montand) does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by the single man daslow (=oswald) and though all other officials want to close the case he continuous to investigate with his team. the screenplay is written tight and fast and holds the tension till the end. just the part dealing with the milgram experiment about authorities is (though not uninteresting) a bit out of place. the ending sequence - explaining who icarus really is - partly shot in slow motion and intensified by a morricone soundtrack is the most powerful sequence i have ever seen in a movie. elvira mistress of the dark (1988): cassandra peterson, daniel greene, william morgan sheppard, susan kellerman, edie mcclug, jeff conaway, phil rubenstein, larry flash jenkins, tress macneille, damita jo freeman, mario celario, william dance, lee mclaughlin, charles woolf, sharon hays, bill cable, joseph arias, scott morris, ira heiden, frank collison, lynne marie stewart, marie sullivan, jack fletcher, robert benedetti, kate brown, hugh gillin, eve smith, raleigh bond, tony burrier, alan dewames, timm hill, read scot, james hogan, derek givens...director james signorelli...screenplay sam egan, john paragon. elvira, mistress of the dark was an 80\\'s tv icon who had her own late night show on cable. she hosted and presented classic american horror films, many of them campy, while providing her own quips and humorous remarks. actress cassandra peterson has to this date ridden on that success. in 1988, her first film was released. playing herself, she\\'s stuck hosting monster movie shows but longs for her own show in las vegas and make big money. her agent manny proves a disappointment. it\\'s not long before she inherits a mansion from a deceased relative, a pet dog and a book of recipes. she comes to claim her inheritance in a small nevada town - she was on her way to vegas and became lost - and soon stirs things up in the sedate community. outspoken conservative town council woman chastity pariah (edie mcclurg) soon sees her as a threat to the decency and values of the small town. her voluptuous figure and winning personality soon draws the youth of the town. she falls for bob redding (daniel greene) the town handyman/carpenter, but before any real relationship can bloom, she finds herself in deep trouble. vincent talbot (william morgan sheppard) an eerie older man who is also set to inherit part of the fortune of elvira\\'s relative is in fact an age-old sorcerer who has a personal vendetta against elvira\\'s aunt and elvira herself. he is aware that the so-called \"recipe book\" is actually a book of powerful magic, a power he wishes to claim for himself. he schemes to bring down elvira by having the town burn her at the stake. how will elvira get out of this one ? the movie was no real success at the box office, drawing a crowd of mostly young audiences familiar with the elvira show on cable. truth be told, this is a funny and feel-good movie. the script is chalk full of all kinds of jokes, some bad, some good, lots of sexual innuendo, visual jokes and overall campiness i.e. the hilarious last scene in which elvira has finally got her own strip show in vegas. this film is a cult classic of sorts, catering to elvira fans. you couldn\\'t enjoy this film otherwise. it\\'s also a look back at \"pop\" culture of the 80\\'s. elvira was as much an icon of the 80\\'s as was alf, vicky the robot, hulk hogan, mr. t and madonna. after two long, long opening skits, one of which my brother saw the conclusion coming of and the other totally joke free, we start the fast-forward fest that it groove tube proper. naturally, uber-stupid frat boys who still mainline jackass or tom green will find the idea of fecal matter coming out of the some tube, sex olympics(i really don\\'t need to give you details, do i), and a clown who basically does the \"not very endearing clown\" bit i think i\\'ve seen approxiately ninety times now will eat this up like dung beetles: well, more power to you. i just want to express that, despite what you\\'ve heard, this movie was in no way a model for the many infinitely funnier movies like kentucky fried movie or what not. the skit movie had already been done in and now for something completely different, everything you always wanted to know about sex, and so on. and done way better. this movie had lots of great actors and actresses in it and it addressed some very noble issues. it\\'s full of emotion and the direction is done well. the storyline progresses very quickly, but i guess that\\'s better than having to watch a 3 hour movie. this is an easy movie to watch again and again and enjoy. give director stanley tong of jackie chan\\'s super cop and rumble in the bronx, and what do you get? you receive a series of kung fu fights and a lack of magoo-like madness. the limited plot has magoo (leslie nielsen) put into an international plot, where he steals a world-renowned gem. of course he has no idea what he is doing. in fact, he has no idea that he had the gem. within thirty minutes you could get very bored watching this. there are some very funny moments though like when he is cooking the chicken. you will wish that you were as nearsighted as magoo. its a fun movie to watch but its quite a disaster! you have to love leslie nielson because he was made some very funny movies. this isn\\'t his best, but he does a good job playing magoo. i thought it was a funny film, and it should be recommended to young children because they will probably think that its very funny. alexandr \"sascha\" luzhin (john turturro) is a former leading chess player attempting a comeback at an italy-hosted tournament. his brilliance is unquestioned but his obsession with chess has stunted his growth in all other aspects of his life. natalia (emily watson) is a beautiful heiress who has come to the same resort with her mother, vera (geraldine james) to scope out possible marriage partners. vera leans toward a handsome count but, astonishingly, natalia is more fascinated by sascha, whom she met on a walk. sascha, too, is taken with natalia and proposes marriage at their second meeting. but, with the concentration that sascha must give to the chess matches and, with other happenings in his past still causing problems, will he win the heart of natalia? oh, and can he become the chess champion, also? this is a lovely film, based on a novel by nabokov. the acting is amazing, with watson very fine as the beautiful little rich girl and turturro utter perfection as the shy, awkward chess enthusiast. james gives quite a nice turn as the overbearing mother and the other cast members are wonderful as well. as for the look of the film, it could not be better. the scenery is of the put-your-eye-out variety, the vintage costumes are gorgeous and the cinematography is deserving of much applause. yes, the story is unusual and told with the use of flashbacks, at times, making it a film not everyone will appreciate. then, too, the ending is bittersweet. however, if you love romance, period pieces, great acting, knockout scenery, or the fine art of motion picture creation, don\\'t miss this one. you will be defenseless in resisting its multitude of charms. i bought this film on dvd despite the \"stale\" review and that was idiotic... that review was completely accurate and i have never seen any worse \"erotic\" film in my long life! even if it partly was lovely filmed and had interesting surroundings, plus a nice cover... but my own extreme erotica (c) films are over 100 times more erotic (just in the soft delicious aspect) with probably less than 100 times of this films budget! the story have no logical connection with the first film or the famous book... or any new (exciting) element of slave training, except some very strange and sad developments... then did the main male character - klaus kinski - not look a bit like the second master of \"o\" he try to play... and not even lovely arielle dombasle, did look delicious in any scene! this film was one that i have waited to see for some time. i was glad to find it has been everything anticipated. the writing of this film has been so finely crafted and researched far beyond what is seen by the audience. i found it amusing that so many people watching will not read between some very important lines but indeed if not the movie will make sense in a different way and is very brilliant. the film has many stories and characters woven together around this one character kilo , a man whom has rose from the streets amidst many woes and become a very powerful criminal. after spending some time in prison kilo finds a loophole in the justice system and through a disturbing turn of events is released only to find everything is not at all what it seems. kilo finds himself going up against the higher realm of society and political royalty in order to make clear how important a man\\'s word is and stands for. a war begins as the street is in arms against lords of wealth and corrupt power. a build up to explosive and powerful non stop twists and turns. this film will leave you riveted. i found the cast of this movie to be outstanding and is not a movie to be ignored. excellent. go rent it today!! in retrospect, the 1970s was a golden era for the american cinema, as demonstrated and explored by this documentary directed by ted demme and richard lagravenese. this ifc effort serves to illustrate and clarify the main idea of what that time meant for the careers of these illustrious people seen in the documentary. the amazing body of work that remains, is a legacy to all the people involved in the art of making movies in that period. the decade was marked by the end of the viet nam war and the turbulent finale of those years of jimmy carter\\'s presidency. one thing comes out clear, films today don\\'t measure against the movies that came out during that creative decade because the industry, as a whole, has changed dramatically. the big studios nowadays want to go to tame pictures that will be instant hits without any consideration to content, or integrity, as long as the bottom line shows millions of dollars in revenues. the other thing that emerges after hearing some of america\\'s best creative minds speak, is the importance of the independent film spirit because it is about the only thing that afford its creators great moral and artistic rewards. this documentary is a must see for all movie fans. the name (frau) of the main character is the german word for \"woman\". i don\\'t know if that was intentional or not, but if sure got some giggles from the german audience at the fantasy film festival last year, when it was shown. but those were the only giggles the movie got. not that it was aiming for giggles, it\\'s a horrible movie for heaven\\'s sake! a horrible movie in more than one meaning. it\\'s a shame that a premise like that was wasted with horrible even unbearable moments for the viewer (definetely not for the faint of heart!!)! and it wasn\\'t even necessary to show all the things that are shown. i\\'m not even going into a moral obligation (because movies don\\'t really have that kind of task or function) discussion of what is shown here, but this is a new low on the whole \"torture movement\" that has grown in the last few years! ah, the classic genre of 80s sex comedies. this is set on two beaches; one a nude beach featuring myriad (fully) unclothed women. the plot? something about a bunch of dimwits attempting to get laid. the usual. fans of gratuitous t&a (and p) should hunt this one down. it\\'s unbelievable but the fourth is better than the second and the third. after the third that was awful, it\\'s incredible how they could have an unexpected sequel with new ideas. chuck is the same nasty doll of the previous movies. interesting the final that lets know that a fifth can be done.... yes, said title line does actually appear in this movie. why? i\\'m not sure. when the line was actually being said, didn\\'t somebody in the crew filming, at some point, laugh? i would have liked to see the outtakes from this movie, mostly because i think they would be more entertaining than the movie itself. helmed by director jim gillespie, (\"i know what you did last summer,\") comes a teen slasher movie that seems to assume we haven\\'t ever seen a teen slasher movie before. of course, he\\'s not to be given all the blame. there are also three writers responsible, and this is somehow based on a video game that\\'s still in production. the title of said game is \"backwater,\" but upon looking for information on it i came up with absolutely nothing. and so we begin the movie... i would like to say before i continue that i wasn\\'t expecting this to win an oscar. when i am in the right mindset, i enjoy a fun horror movie to pass the time. i think there exists an opportunity for an effective, original, and smart slasher movie. \"venom\" is not this movie. there is almost no character development at all. that\\'s fine. you don\\'t expect a whole lot. however, instead of a well-knit cast of a few, this movie decides to introduce us to the following many horror movie clichã© characters... 1. the final girl: she has just broken up for her boyfriend. this means that at some point in the movie when they are in peril, they will decide to get back together again. which more than likely means he will die and she will be the last remaining survivor of the movie. \"eden\" is played by agnes bruckner, without much enthusiasm, i might add. 2. the boyfriend: he\\'s just around to co-exist with the final girl until his demise. sure, he can save her, but he\\'s doomed and we know it. \"eric\" is played by jonathan jackson. 3. the bimbos: usually horror movies only feel the need for one of these, but here we have two. they shoplift, they steal, they might show their breasts, (not in this case,) or they might possibly be alcoholics. a staple of the genre. they also wander around in dimly lit areas all on their lonesome, usually saying things like, \"hello? is there anybody there?\" \"tammy\" and \"patty,\" suitably named, are played by bijou phillips and davetta sherwood. 4. the jackass: sure, he looks pretty, but he\\'s the idiot in the movie that\\'s inserted purely to be an idiot. he says stupid things, does stupid things, has obviously never seen a horror movie, and is one of enjoyable kills you watch this kind of thing for. \"sean\" is played by d.j. cotrona. 5. the girlfriend: she loves the jackass even though pretty much nobody else does, and she\\'s usually the one left alive for a while so she can scream and cry until she starts tripping and gets left behind. \"rachel\" is played by laura ramsey. 6. the creepy janitor: in this case, the creepy gas station attendant. enough said. \"ray\" is played by rick cramer. i could continue, but i think you get the picture. the remaining characters aren\\'t so much common as they are equally killable. there\\'s \"the gay guy,\" (pawel szajda as \"ricky,\") who definitely got robbed as far as screen time is concerned, and \"the one who knows what\\'s going on.\" of course none of that matters, because at first everyone always thinks that one\\'s crazy. \"cece\" is played by meagan good. there are a couple other characters, namely a deputy played by method man, but he and others are killed off pretty quickly and get even less character development than the following clichã©s. so, you\\'re probably thinking, \"why does this movie require such a deep analysis? it\\'s just a summer horror flick, for cryin\\' out loud!\" based on that question, does it deliver the goods? yes, and no. the acting isn\\'t particularly convincing, even given the amount of talent involved. bijou phillips was hailed for her performance in larry clark\\'s bully, and agnes bruckner has been an up-and-coming talent for a while now. so, what about the gore? there\\'s some. that\\'s really about it. a lot of the juiciest bits are cut-aways. namely a scene involving somebody\\'s face and a sandblaster used to remove paint from cars. to the filmmaker\\'s credit, there are a couple interesting scenes. i liked the bit where part of a house was literally ripped off so that the unstoppable villain could get to the characters. if this had all been centered around a smarter screenplay in which the characters didn\\'t make the same dumb mistakes literally hundreds of horror movie characters had made before them, it might have made for a more enjoyable experience. all of the most interesting characters are immediately killed off in the first third of the movie and then it just becomes a not-particularly-interesting countdown until we know it\\'s just the creepy janitor and the final girl. i suppose i must be a little jaded, but as a horror film fan, i\\'m left wondering why i should have bothered when i could easily have written a better screenplay myself. i won\\'t even mention the numerous instances of terrible cgi. the script was very weak w/o enough character arcs to make you care one bit about the characters or what happens to them. the script is way too talky and not enough gore or action to even call it slow paced. the story gets to the point that you just want everyone to shut up and die as quickly as possible so you don\\'t have to listen to them talk this very muted, stiff dialogue. on a technical note, the music mix is way to high and makes it hard to understand what is being said most times. then again, this could be called a blessing. overall, this same story could have better been told in a short film w/ a running time under 30 minutes. the obvious \"in your face\" homages to sam raimi and \"evil dead\" would have been good had they been more subtle, but here they seem more like a bald faced rip off. c\\'mon, this kind of 35mm budget and this is the best that could be done? still, the cinematography, lighting design and shots were very well done indeed. pathetic... worse than a bad made-for-tv movie. i can\\'t believe that spacey and freeman were in this flick. for some reason morgan freeman\\'s character is constantly talking about and saying \"pussy\" when referring to nsync boy\\'s girlfriend. morgan freeman calling women \"pussy\" is just awkward... what the hell were the people behind this film thinking? too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting, confusing camera angles, a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearable. i rented this flop with low expectations.... but... well... it really sucked. franco proves, once again, that he is the prince of surreal & erotic cinema. true, much of his work can be viewed as entertaining sleaze but with succubus (necronomicon) he shows what he is truly capable of when he lets his warped creativity run riot and gives us a film that is both hypnotic and enigmatic whilst still maintaining the delirious eroticism intrinsic in his work. jerry van rooyen\\'s splendid score pulsates as the viewer is thrown from one bizarre scenario to another as we follow the trials of a striptease artist (reynaud) who may be schizophrenic, or may indeed (as one mysterious character states) be a devil, attempt to come to terms with the world she inhabits. a beautiful and enigmatic piece of cinema highly recommended to anybody with even a passing interest in alternative cinema. peter cushing and donald pleasance are legendary actors, and director kostas karagiannis was the man behind the successful greek giallo-esquire thriller death kiss in 1974; and yet when you combine the three talents, all you get is this complete load of drivel! god only knows what drove the likes of peter cushing and donald pleasance to star in this cheapie devil worship flick, but i really do hope they were well paid as neither one deserves something as amateurish as this on their resumes. the story focuses on a group of devil worshippers that kidnap some kids, leading another group to go after them. the pace of the plot is very slow and this ensures that the film is very boring. the plot is also a long way from being original and anyone with even a passing interest in the horror genre will have seen something a bit like this, and no doubt done much better. the obvious lack of budget is felt throughout and the film doesn\\'t manage to overcome this at any point. this really is a depressing and miserable watch and not even a slightly decent ending manages to up the ante enough to lift this film out of the very bottom of the barrel. extremely poor stuff and definitely not recommended! please don\\'t waste your time. this movie rehashes the worst of bram stoker\\'s dracula (van helsing), anne rice\\'s vampire lestat (rock music and silly biblical references), and blade (high-tech toys). i really like vampire movies and novels, and there are many out there that are very good . but not this stinker. not even the soundtrack helps it, mostly because the movie resorts to ridiculous scary classical music rather than the \"kick-ass metal\" some reported. only a few times did i hear any metal; mostly it was tortured violins. avoid it like garlic and crucifixes. i have seen already fantastic stories, but the premises of this one are so unbelievable that it comes very close to being ridiculous. a rich and young guy undergoes a heart transplant the day after his marriage, and he is somehow witnessing his own surgery and the plot of his surgeons to kill him. even if there is a medical explanation to such a phenomenon what next happens is a mixture of dialog among ... say ... souls? ... maybe and real life where the dedicated mother will do everything to save the life of her son. there is no shade of suspense or thrill, just a combination of a bad and simplistic plot with a series of coincidences that can never happen in life. this is not to say that the film is completely lacking quality - actually first time director joby harold does a decent job in directing a good team of actors that includes hayden christensen at his first major role after having taken off the anakin skywalker costume, fabulous jessica alba and super-gifted lena olin. all would have deserved a better story. that\\'s pretty ridiculous, i hope many people are exposed to muslims who live all over the u.s, u.k, and all over the world. the religion has over a billion followers. i myself born and bread in america and through my religious classes and teachings i have been taught to cherish my country and work to contribute to the society. i am very dedicated to the followings and teachings of my religion have been stressed through out life to educate and prepare oneself for success through education in order to contribute back to the world. i have know many muslims from all over and i have traveled to countries like pakistan..i have yet to meet one person who believes that we should hurt anyone or not accept any other religion except from the people in the media...i wonder why... also its sad that these extremists are the ones the media use to represent a whole religion. its a religion of one billion people, and these are less than one percent, i am sure the other people of other religions would not like to be represented by the kkk, ira and many more which are simple small percentage extremists who use outdated and not literal passages from the respected books in order to pursue their own revenge, personal, or business matters through their so called religion despite a small handful of nicely executed scenes, this entry (the fourth) feels tired. toshiharu ikeda, who directed the superb mermaid legend and the seminal japanese splatter film, evil dead trap, shows little enthusiasm for the stale premise. a miscreant becomes obsessed with an outwardly conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in a porno photo shoot. predictable stalking, harassing, assault and rape ensues. the staple of roman porno is sex. and sex mixed with violence. both potentially exciting subjects, to be sure, but not when so little effort is made to make them fresh. a masturbation scene in which a woman forces pencils up her opening (via condom) is too little kink to late. the series\\' rain motif continues and the film\\'s final scene brings relief. (this review is based on the english language version) orson welles\\' legendary unfinished epic was just that - unfinished. it should have been left as such, not thrown together in this clumsy, boring compilation of whatever material was available. while i\\'m sure it was done with the best of intentions, the filmmakers have not only failed to do justice to welles\\' vision, they\\'ve also managed to discredit it by inflicting this version upon audiences. the first thing that strikes the viewer is the amateurish quality of the audio. not only are the newly dubbed voices rather poor performances, they\\'re also inconsistent - welles\\' original recordings (using his own voice, as he often did) have been retained in a handful of scenes, & they don\\'t match at all. there hasn\\'t been the slightest attempt at consistency. add to that an extremely empty sound mix which has only a bare minimum of sound effects & atmos - a long sequence during a huge festival (including the running of the bulls) sounds like it was recorded in a deserted suburban street with about three people making the sound of a crowd that\\'s meant to be in the thousands. however, the real problem is the unavoidable fact that \\'don quixote\\' was incomplete, & it\\'s glaringly obvious from watching this. the film consists of a handful of scenes strung together & dragged out to ridiculous lengths just to make up the running time. case in point - the sequence where sancho searches for don quixote in the city goes on forever. it\\'s just sancho approaching people in the crowd, asking them the same questions over & over again - there is no way that welles could ever have intended using every single take in its entirety, but that\\'s what appears here. it lasts over twelve minutes, when, in fact, it would most likely have lasted about two minutes absolute maximum in a proper finished version of the film. while the start of the film is relatively complete & rather well done, the rest has massive holes which simply can\\'t be filled with endless overlay of spanish countryside & still more shots of don quixote & sancho going back & forth. there\\'s also no ending. no resolution, no conclusion, no punchline, no point. although there is material in private collections that was unavailable to the filmmakers, that couldn\\'t possibly account for what would be required to make this into a complete, coherent work. welles simply didn\\'t complete shooting, largely due to the fact that his lead actor died before they could finish. however, putting aside the fact that it wasn\\'t complete, & never could be, one would think that just seeing a collection of footage from this masterpiece that might have been would be enough. unfortunately, by putting it all together in such a slipshod manner, one is left with a very negative impression of the film overall. in particular, what was clearly a terrific performance from akim tamiroff as sancho is utterly ruined with the new voice & with long, drawn out scenes that eventually cause him to be simply irritating. orson welles\\' vision for this film was something far more ambitious & complex than a simple retelling of the story of don quixote, but that\\'s what has been attempted here, & as such, the point is lost. the only person who could have assembled all the material into anything worthwhile would have been welles himself, & he didn\\'t. the footage could have been put to far better use in a documentary chronicling the whole saga of welles trying to make the film. welles himself even came up with the perfect title for such a doco: \"when are you going to finish don quixote?\" saw the move while in paris in may 2006 ... i was debating between that and mission impossible...i am very glad i choose oss 117 not only because it was funny but might as well watch a french movie while in france. i had a great time... would recommend it. it is important to have some understanding the french society of today to really enjoy the humor of this movie ... cannot wait for the dvd to come out... i don\\'t know how some of the \\'jeu de mots\\' \\'puns\\' would be translated in english i \\'ll certainly buy it when it is out! p.s. i saw on \\'brice de nice\\' which is a movie starring dujardin that all kids were talking about in france. this movie is a comedy but sillier than one can imagine...in comparing both movies i have to say that dujardin did a good job in oss 117. i saw this recently on a cable channel. the movie is great; it\\'s one of the few musicals i have seen that doesn\\'t shy away from the light and dark. it portrays some of the splendour of the age along with a lot of the squalor. some of the set piece dance sequences so much is going on, i didn\\'t know where to look next. one day i shall go and see this on the big screen, just so that i see what\\'s happening. but what really lifts this to another level is oliver reed\\'s performance as bill sykes. not only is a thoroughly mean and menacing man but there is something else, some inner demons. he gave me the impression that if you pushed him into a corner, he was capable of anything. it was almost as if the sykes character was on the edge of madness, just awaiting the trigger. i have seen the robert newton\\'s bill sykes from the 1948 movie, and i thought he was \\'just\\' a bad egg, but oliver reed\\'s performance intimidated me in my own living room. lcdr tom dodge, despite having a reputation among submariners as a renegade and maverick (*note to reader: maverick does not mean \"tom cruise\". maverick means \"non-conformist\".), is actually an intelligence operative for the vice admiral of his submarine fleet. the vice-admiral is concerned about our old friends the russians hosting yard sales with their old diesel fleets. countries like lybia, north korea or iraq would love to get their hands on this baby and slip a nuclear warhead into norfolk harbour or mayport, florida. and this was 6-7 years before 9/11. the admiral assigns dodge to assume command of a moth-balled wwii diesel sub and mount an exercise against the surface fleet and the uss orlando, a top of the line fast attack sub. dodge takes command and in no time whips up the bad news bears.. err i mean his lovable group of oddball submariners into warriors. despite having \"welcome aboard\" tattooed on his penis, he is a competent and fair commander, he does not choose favorites and he delegates authority in a responsible manner. the us navy could not have come up with a finer piece of recruitment propaganda than this handsomely made under-appreciated gem from the creator of \"police academy\". what an awful adaptation. the worst part was the music. saxophone muzak and synthesizers playing in a story set in the early 1800\\'s?????? the only character that didn\\'t bore me to sleep was robert hardy. i had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one, and i love jane austen movies usually. i didn\\'t even rent it, i borrowed it from the library. they should have paid me to take it. i don\\'t quite understand how catherine and henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when throughout the movie they had no chemistry or indication whatsoever that they cared for one another. isabella and her brother were way overdone; it was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the \"bad guys\" and part of the excitement of jane austen movies is the discovery that who you think is good, isn\\'t. this is probably on my list of the ten worst movies i\\'ve seen. the movie with its single set, minimal cast, and straightforward photography (except for a couple of brief special effects) reminds me of one of those old 60 minute playhouse dramas so popular during tv\\'s early years. nonetheless, the suspense hangs heavy over poor war widow ida lupino as she tries to deal with her semi-psychotic handyman robert ryan before one of his mood-swings kills her. and who better to play the troubled part than that great actor ryan. he wasn\\'t very versatile-- watching him essay comedy is almost painful. but no one was better at wounded idealism (on dangerous ground) or the psychic pain of this movie. few actors could express as much with their eyes as this lean and towering figure. lupino\\'s problem is that she\\'s locked up in her house with a man who is kind and gentle one moment and raging the next. the suspense comes from her various ploys to keep him happy while trying to escape. it\\'s a nail-biter all the way. this is not one of lupino\\'s many fine \"soulful\" parts that she was so good at. instead, it\\'s a role many lesser actresses could have handled well enough. my favorite scene is with ryan and bratty teenager margaret whiting. ryan\\'s already having difficulty with his masculinity and what others are saying about him. then when whiting walks in and finds the attractive-looking ryan scrubbing the floor, she starts getting coy, flirting with her budding sexuality. sensing trouble, ryan abruptly fends her off-- finesse is not his strong suit. insulted, whiting attacks his masculinity by calling his work \"women\\'s work\". that does it. up to that point he\\'s been courteous and professional with lupino, trying to set himself on a normal path. but whiting has hit his raw nerve. now there\\'s heck to pay as whiting bounces out the door, leaving lupino to pay the price. it\\'s a riveting scene, expertly done. anyway, this is one of the dozen or so films produced by lupino and her husband at a time when audiences were moving away from these little black-and-whites in favor of wide-screen spectacles. too bad. what a hugely talented figure she was both behind the camera and in front. she deserves at least an honorary oscar from a movie industry to which she contributed so much. this movie suffers from the fact that for years hollywood had no clue as to how to package jackie chan for the masses. his low-budget hong kong movies were all fast-paced kinetic thrillers that highlight his amazing gymnastic skills and talent for light comedy. his early hollywood films stuck him in the same movies that were being packaged for stallone or chuck norris. there is nothing about chan\\'s character in this movie that requires the character to be asian except for his being the star. in his hong kong films chan is never dull, with the movies being one rapid-fire martial arts sequence after another, but \"the protector\" is lifeless throughout. danny aiello isn\\'t given much to work with either and the lacking chemistry between the two probably is more a result of the script and direction than how the two actors got on together. both have been better in worse movies. the best thing about the movie is the hong kong settings. the worst part is the appalling way that jackie chan comes off so colorless and drab. it wouldn\\'t be until the made-in-canada \"rumble in the bronx\" that the west would finally figure out how to make a good jackie chan movie. the premise sucked me in, but it was clear about 30 seconds in that this was either david lynch or something seriously terrible. interesting to watch just to run through the fundamentalist laundry list. i can be a sucker for a stirring spiritual piece (romero comes to mind), but there was nothing spiritual whatsoever about this one. the message seems to be that we must all pretend we have an iq of 80 (or simply get a lobotomy - jennifer what happened to ya?) and blindly follow the bible without any sort of self-examination whatsoever or we\\'ll trigger the second coming. it\\'s the kind of attitude that makes people fly jumbo jets into 110 story buildings (i work around the corner from the site of the former wtc). i like to think that god is a little greater than that. there was some good build up of suspense throughout. the cinematography was surprisingly good considering such minimal budget. we witness occasional spells of good acting, however, this is quickly deflated by some quite cheesy lines. understandably there would not be much of an intellectual conversation to be had, sitting up on trees while a crocodile is stalking you. silence would have been golden here. there could have been a bigger play on suspense than dimly uttering, \"i sat in the cupboard for fear of my brother...\" something tells me there\\'s a slight difference in getting a beating from your brother than being eaten by a mighty 15ft croc. you decide. throughout the film i can\\'t seem to find a connection or for that matter, sympathy with the characters, perhaps thats because they don\\'t develop one throughout the film, character that is. there are some occasional good scares when the crocodile sneaks up on the characters, overshadowed again by some questionable scenes. in one instance we should be terrified by an ear floating in the water but later we sit beside a decapitated, limbless corpse and only worry about a broken finger. a definite roller coaster of a film when it comes to logic. super troopers was an instant classic. club dread, while disappointing to many, had its moments. puddle cruisers has fewer moments. i saw this movie on the shelf of my local video store and saw at the bottom that it was made by the broken lizard group who made super troopers, so naturally i picked it up. i only found one scene to be laugh out loud funny. a far cry from super troopers. all in all, i was very disappointed. i would not recommend this to anyone, unless you have an abundance of free time, and really need to kill some time. however, you\\'re better off playing video games, or watching something that might make you laugh or think. yes, this review may contain spoilers, but you\\'ll thank me for it. this is the worst film i\\'ve seen in quite some time. i came to this board expecting to see the same response i had, but inexplicably, there are several people who love this film and spacey\\'s performance in particular. some will chastise me for saying it, but i find kevin spacey\\'s acting quite limited despite the world\\'s admiration for him. i felt like i was watching a meaner version of kevin\\'s \"american beauty\" role. his character in this film is ridiculously overacted, all the way down to his laughable insults he throws at his assistant. there are all-world trite and boring scenes like when spacey is tearing into whaley about bringing him equal instead of sweat and low. somehow, i suspected this particular scene was supposed to be funny, but by this time i was ready to hit the stop button (this is approximately 20 minutes into the film). what about the faux-homage to \"resevoir dogs\"? whaley proclaims, \"i think i saw this in a movie once,\" as if he\\'s going to cut off spacey\\'s ear. but what does he use to cut him? an envelope! that\\'s right, he\\'s going to give him paper cuts! that has to be one of hollywood\\'s all-time worst scenes, and the fact that the actors and director tried to carry it out with a straight face makes it even more appalling. i will admit that i didn\\'t see the end of this film (my dvd mercifully locked up about a half hour before the end), but anyone who wishes to say so could spare me the line that i missed a great twist and everything would have made sense. well, i don\\'t care what happened in the end, because it could never make up for all that bad acting and relentlessly over-the-top dialogue. i even got the feeling that the actors themselves wanted to get out of this film as bad as i did. ordinarily, anthony mann made westerns with \\'the big guys\\' - james stewart, gary cooper, henry fonda . . . the a list cowboy stars. but in this b+ film, he tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western. the main character, played by victor mature, is a trapper/ mountain man, and ordinarily they are romanticized in films - robert redford in jeremiah johnson, that sort of thing, where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men. not here. for once, a true mountain man - vulgar, crude, animalistic - is the central figure, and it\\'s something to see, giving mature one of his better later roles. the real acting chops are provided by robert preston, excellent as a self-absorbed custer type cavalry commander, and james whitmore, the poor man\\'s spencer tracy, as another of those old timers who feel themselves trapped between ever more hostile indians on the one side and the oncoming force of civilization on the other. even more impressive is a very young anne bancroft as the officer\\'s wife, who is initially repulsed by the very sight of mature\\'s grisly character, then finds her own veneer of civilization slipping away as she begins to realize, to her own shock, that she\\'s attracted to him. rarely if ever has a remote frontier fort been so accurately realized on screen, without the romantic allure that john ford gave such a place in his masterful fort apache. the battle sequences are big scale and notably violent, and particularly impressive if you seen them in widescreen format. good show, and underrated movie, all around. the movie\\'s storyline is pat and quaint. two women travel through the middle east and discover themselves. unfortunately, if you are looking for a movie about the middle east and central asia this is absolutely terrible. the producers of the film either did no research or were unbelievably lazy when filming it. to begin with, and most glaringly incorrect, the nuristanis, as they were known in the thirties, and indeed since the 1890s and their forceful conversion by abdul-rahman shah of aghnaistan, were not nomads. in fact they have not been nomads since the aryan invasions of central asia over three milenia ago. second, the city that is filmed as tehran is not tehran, which is understandable, however the geography of the area around the city could not be more strikingly different than the city of tehran, which is surrounded on all side by a large mountain range, which predominates all of the cities views. third, persian, despite the fact it is spoken in iran and afghanistan, is never heard in movie. when there are native speakers who do not speak in german they speak in arabic. the \\'persian\\' guards at the border, in fact, say to each other \\'ma hadha rujal\\' (this is not a man) and not \\'in mard nist\\' as it would be in persian. also, the love song between the indian princess and one of the main characters is obviously in spanish. while talking in the garden one of the main characters says that the quran uses the words \\'ferdos\\' and \\'jehaan\\' and makes some reference to drugs afterwords. these words certainly never appear in the quran as they are persian for paradise (indeed, ferdos and paradise are very distant cognates between our languages) and \\'world\\' respectively, though jehaan is admittedly close to \\'jehennan\\' which is hell in arabic. when they encounter the nomads in the desert the language spoken is also arabic, this despite the fact that there are no native speakers of arabic in iran and afghanistan and its use is primarily religious, with some use in education at that time. when they are stopped in iran before they reach the afghan border the people they encounter are wholly unlike any iranian group. their tents are typically bedouin with carpets decorating the walls and a high profile. in iran it is also extremely uncommon for people to wear turbans unless they are a cleric. the language spoken is clearly arabic from the initial greeting of \\'ahlan wa sahlan.\\' when they do reach kabul the desert they find themselves in is sandy, totally unlike the rock dirt that is found in the arid parts of the hindu kush mountain range. there is an absence of the light green scrub that covers the ground in the summer and spring. the area is also not wholly consumed by the extreme mountains of the mountain range that won its name, the indian killers, because of its difficult and limiting ground. in short, the story line is the only thing in this movie that holds any water and it is still weak and common place. it lacks any real draw to it, being merely the tale of two women trying to learning about themselves as they get to nuristan, however, even that is still-born and no real development is felt, leaving the characters in the end just where they were in the beginning and nothing has changed except that world war two has broken loose. in short, this is a really bad movie that i would have rated at one star except for the good footage of bedouin and the deserts of the levant, even if they are misnamed. the bloodsucker leads the dance - what a laughable title, it\\'s so utterly misleading. it\\'s not surprising that the film-makers try and mislead us though because this is one terrible movie. the story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island. very little happens in this film. and when something does wake the viewer from his stupor, it invariably is unintentional comedy in the form of atrocious dialogue delivered by a hopeless group of voice-artists. these guys are so bad they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like a group of remedial-level morons. it really is hard to determine how bad the acting is when you have dubbing this abysmal. but the voice-artists cannot be blamed for the script. it\\'s a travesty. unintentionally funny at best, pathetic at worst. the story in general is, to say the least, uneven. the women characters are particularly idiotic; the men are either creepy or tedious. the whole enterprise smacks of pure exploitation of the audience. it doesn\\'t remotely deliver what it promises and even when the murders (finally) start happening, they all occur off screen. all we get is a few half-hearted severed head shots. a few people have said that this movie is a giallo. i cannot agree less with this opinion. anyone who enjoys italian thrillers should give this movie a wide berth as there is nothing remotely thrilling about it. it\\'s basically a soft-core porn film with a horror angle. but it\\'s not very erotic either. i can\\'t recommend this to anyone. i thoroughly enjoyed this film, which in many ways, as hitchcock did on several occasions, was a first attempt at a plot which he re-shot later in his career. possibly the most amazing thing about it, however, is how faceless the lead characters are. after watching, one remembers murray alper as the jovial truck driver, vaughan glaser\\'s touching turn as a blind \"patriot\", the unforgettable traveling freak show and of course otto kruger as the suave and sophisticated villain, all of whom completely overshadow bob cummings as the rather wooden fugitive (compare that bridge jump to harrison ford\\'s similar stunt in andrew davis\\' \"the fugitive\") and priscilla lane whose change of heart and subsequent love towards cummings is never quite believable. the other major support player is, of course, hitchcock himself who bookends the film with 2 extraordinary stunts. many people criticise the older films for their lack of realistic special effects. my feelings are that with lack of technology, to even attempt and convey what the director wants to show is an amazing achievement. obviously this film carries an anti-fascist message, made at the time of the second world war, but being a hitchcock it is never the most important thing and the emphasis is always on the action. well worth checking out, especially for the support roles. man, i really wanted to like these shows. i am starving for some good television and i applaud tnt for providing these \"opportunites\". but, sadly, i am in the minority i guess when it comes to the cinematic stephen king. as brilliant as king\\'s writing is, the irony is that it simply doesn\\'t translate well to the screen, big or small. with few exceptions (very few), the king experience cannot be filmed with the same impact that the stories have when read. many people would disagree with this, but i\\'m sure that in their heart of hearts they have to admit that the best filmed king story is but a pale memory of the one they read. the reason is simple. the average king story takes place in the mind-scape of the characters in the story. he gives us glimpses of their inner thoughts, their emotions and their sometimes fractured or unreal points of view. in short, king takes the reader places where you can\\'t put a panavision camera. as an audience watching the filmed king, we\\'re left with less than half the information than the reader has access to. it\\'s not too far a stretch to claim that one becomes a character in a king story they read, whereas one is limited to petty voyeurism of that same character when filmed. for as long as king writes, hollywood will try shooting everything that comes out of his word processor, without any regard to whether or not they should. i don\\'t blame the filmmakers for trying, but it takes an incredible amount of talent and circumspection to pull off the elusive stephen king adaptation that works. the task is akin to turning lead into gold, or some arcane zen mastery. oh well, better luck next time. on the way back from imc6 (san jose, california), all five (mind you, three of us hardcore kamal fans) of us had reached a unanimous verdict; vv was solid crap and thanks to the movie we were going to have a pretty screwed up monday. not to mention, we swore to stay off the theatres for the next year. i won\\'t blame kamal here because he sort of dropped a hint in a recent interview with cartoonist madan (on vijay tv). he said something like, \"tamizh cinema\\'la photography, editing\\'la namba munnera\\'na maadri screenplay, direction, acting\\'la innum namba munnera\\'la\" (tamil cinema has grown in terms of photography and editing, but we have hardly improved, when it comes to screenplay, direction and acting\"). while you\\'re watching vv, those words ring very true. now, here are the 10 reasons to hate this movie: 1. harris jeyaraj 2. harris jeyaraj 3. harris jeyaraj i\\'m barely holding myself from using expletives here, but fact is hj has mastered the fine knack of screwing up every recent movie of his (remember \\'anniyan\\', \\'ghajini\\') with the jarring cacophony, he bills as background music. the next time i have an eardrum transplant, he\\'s paying for it. 4. songs neither do the songs help move the movie\\'s narration spatially/temporally nor do they make you sit up and take notice. the film feels like it\\'s made of four very long songs with a few scenes thrown in between them. 5. a short gone too far. vv at best is fit to be a short story, not a 2 hour plus \"thriller\". to use a clichã© here, like the energizer bunny it goes on and on and on; only in this case you don\\'t want it to. the later part of a movie feels like a big drag. 6. kamal-jothika pairing two ice cubes rubbed together could\\'ve produced more sparks than this lead pairing. there\\'s no reason you would root for them to make it together. in fact every time they get together in the second half of the movie, they make a good irritant to the narration. hate to say this, but kamalini mukerjhee\\'s 10 minute romancing does more than what kamal and jothika achieve in this movie plus \\'thenali\\'. 7. kamal haasan\\'s accent kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either in india or in the us; and it isn\\'t new either. he\\'s been doing it since \\'thoongadae thambi thoongadae\\'. it\\'s simply gets on the nerve. imagine what havoc it can cause when his flair for using this strange accent meets shooting on location in the us. he doesn\\'t leave it at the immigration either, he offers doses of advice to his men (bewildered tn cops from keeranor, sathoor and beyond) in chaste kamanglish (\"wha we hav here is plain bad police wok\"), of course with nauseating effect. 8. logic there are a few directors whom you expect to stand up to a certain scale. gautam fails us badly with some crappy performance in the department of common sense. which d.c.p in his senses would meet his love interest on the streets to discuss such matters as committing himself and life after! the scene inside the theatre was so bad, towards the climax; we could hear people behind us loudly challenge the hero\\'s iq. \"is he stupid, can\\'t he just use his siren or lights?\" (on a busy madras road, kamal-the-cop-on-a-police-jeep chases a guy on a bike just like any ordinary dude!). \"can\\'t he just use his gun?\" (\"the guy on a bike\" starts on foot and we have a fully geared kamal in hot pursuit for a considerable amount of time). i\\'m not voting in favour of the later, but i\\'m just trying to explain the mood inside. 9. gore & violence if i wanted to watch women being raped, their throats getting slashed, more women getting raped and thrown into the bushes with excruciating authenticity, i would sit at home and rather watch a \"police report\" or \"kuttram\". the use of excessive violence should go in a way to extend the story, not overwhelm it! somewhere down the line gautum seems confused about what the extensions (rapes, murders) are and what the mainstay (story) is! 10. even a double shot espresso couldn\\'t get the pain out of the head. i completely agree with jamrom4.. this was the single most horrible movie i have ever seen.. holy crap it was terrible.. i was warned not to see it..and foolishly i watched it anyway.. about 10 minutes into the painful experience i completely gave up on watching the atrocity..but sat through until the end..just to see if i could.. well i did and now i wish i had not..it was disgusting..nothing happened and the ending was all preachy..no movie that bad has the right to survive..i implore all of you to spare yourself the terror of fatty drives the bus..if only i had heeded the same warning..please save yourself from this movie..i have a feeling those who rated it highly were involved in the making of the movie..and should all be wiped off the face of the planet.. jessica: a ghost story is as the name implies a ghost story. the theme is meant to be horror but comes across closer to comedy! a woman comes who was brutally murdered comes back from the dead. this constitutes what this movie attempts to pass off as a plot. there is really nothing more to it. the movie comprises of a series of loosely connected scenes involving a guy who had an affair with this woman prior to her death. immediately from the opening scenes, this movie has the appearance of a \"straight-to-dvd\" effort. unlike gems such as vacancy 2, the movie has no sense of direction or creativity and certainly gives \"straight-to-dvd\" movies a bad name! the direction is as poor as can be with a complete lack of suspense, scares or tension. even the drama elements are hopelessly handled and represent something more boring than even the worst soap opera you may have had the misfortune of enduring. the acting across the board is absolutely abysmal with no one actor involved managing to show even the slightest potential of a successful acting career. many of the individual scenes are incredibly long, with very long pauses between dialogue exchanges. i\\'m not exaggerating! the only reason i give this movie a rating of 2 rather than 1 is because some of the poor acting combined with even worse dialogue made for a few unintentional laughs. i stress the word \"few\" in that sentence. this is not overall one of the \"so-bad-it\\'s-good\" movies like camp blood or the nail gun massacre. if you want to laugh hysterically, watch those movies. if you want to see a proper horror movie about ghosts watch the legend of hell house, the changeling, ringu, the eye (original korean version), the grudge, one missed call or phone. i advise anyone who has had the good fortune of avoiding seeing jessica: a ghost story to keep up the good work! just forget this movie exists. don\\'t spare a thought for it! i found the documentary entitled fast, cheap, and out of control to be a fairly interesting documentary. the documentary contained four \"mini\" documentaries about four interesting men. each one of these men was extremely involved with his job, showing sheer love and enjoyment for one\\'s job. the sad part, i must say, would have to be the subjects in which these individuals worked/studied. they were interesting for about five minutes, afterwards becoming boring and lasting entirely too long. the video was filmed in a very creative way though. i very much enjoyed the film of one thing with a voice dub over another. it played out excellent and also coincided nicely with the music. i got encouraged to watch this film because i\\'ve heard good word of it: it was supposed to be this thrilling true crime milestone, disturbing, shocking... all that jazz. well, i am disturbed because i spent money on it, and i am shocked that something so god-awful actually got released. that\\'s about it. this is a supposed \"new look\" at charles manson\\'s family of insane loser junkies and their murders. but if this is a \"new look\" then it\\'s probably \"new\" as in \"fresh and totally inept\": just watching it gave me a headache and i had to give up trying to make any sense of it or even understand just what the director intended it to be. i suppose i should say something about the plot but fact is, it was so stupid and incoherent that i barely remember if there even was a plot at all. there was something about a \"manson tape\" delivered to a radio dj (or a tv producer?), then an hour of pointless random footage of \"the family\" in \\'69, then the polanski murders (looking like a bad school play) and finally some idiotic part about a bunch of skinheads getting drunk and beating the hell out of one another in an alley (i kid you not), and then it ended (thank god) (don\\'t ask me to make any sense of that, i\\'m just recalling what i saw!) the performances were terrible, too. and how difficult is it to make a convincing \"manson\"? get a short skinny scrawny bloke, put a dirty wig and a shaggy beard on him. there\\'s your manson. but this \"manson\" doesn\\'t even look right. he just looks like, uh, a bloke in a cheap wig and a glued on santa beard painted black. or maybe that\\'s what this film is actually about: manson\\'s family didn\\'t make any sense, so this film doesn\\'t make any sense, either. it\\'s symbolic! (yeah, right) i\\'m still so angry at spending money on this i stopped my normal lurking on this site and registered just to vote 1 for this film and post this warning that will hopefully prevent others from spending their money on this garbage. stay away from it, it\\'s not even worth renting. ps. the recent us tv production \"helter skelter\" got bad reviews here but i saw it last month (i saw the 1976 original too) and let me tell you, compared to \"manson family\", that new helter skelter is brilliant and flawless. and i was disappointed in it! that\\'s how bad \"manson family\" is: it makes a flawed and mostly disappointing tv movie look perfect. just two comments....seven years apart? hardly evidence of the film\\'s relentless pulling-power! as has been mentioned, the low-budget telemovie status of 13 gantry row is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal. having said that however the thing is not without merit - either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se. true, the plot at its most basic is a re-working of the amityville horror - only without much horror. more a case of intrigue! gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played halifax -investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the \"house\" as the main suspect. the script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard. it just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments. having picked the dvd up for a mere $3.95 last week at my regular video store, i cannot begrudge the expenditure. $10.95 would be an acceptable price for the film. just don\\'t expect fireworks! this filmfour funded sci-fi movie is most definitely a must see. while it takes huge influence from the manchurian candidate and offers nothing new or original plot wise; it\\'s handled with the utmost skill that it comes off as being fresh and inventive, despite it being basically a re-run of an earlier film. it\\'s good to know that films like this are still being made (even if they aren\\'t getting wide releases), and cypher is refreshing for that reason. the plot twists and turns, which gives it an element of paranoia and also serves in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of cypher\\'s mystery. the plot follows morgan sullivan; a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with digicorp that involves him listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for reasons, to him, unknown. however, his job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young lady known as rita... this film features a number of stark white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with it\\'s apocalyptic imaging of the future. this gives the film a very odd look that sets it apart from the majority of other films of the same type, with it\\'s only real close affiliate being kubrick\\'s a clockwork orange. the plot is also very efficient and ditches character development in favour of the more stylish - and more thrilling - plot developing. you never quite know where you are with the plot, which serves in making it all the more intriguing. the acting is largely good with a largely unknown cast backing up the team of stars; jeremy northam and lucy lui. northam very much looks the part of the quiet and disheartened man at the centre of the tale, and does well with his role. lucy lui is an actress that has a resume that doesn\\'t quite fit her talent, but she has a look about her that just fits this movie. cypher is far from perfect as some of the sequences are illogical and at times it can be inconsistent; but on the whole, if you want an inventive recent sci-fi film; cypher is the way to go. any one who has seen mel gibson\\'s the passion of the christ and was bothered by the gory violence would want to see this film instead. though it wasn\\'t a success in th box office or tv ratings, the fox movie channel still finds a real good motive to show this anually. i liked the way that they trained chris sarandon and the men who portrayed his disciples to sing in hebrew.though sarandon didn\\'t have long hair like any other jesus would in other films, his looks are pretty close to what a jewish man would appear. what surprised me or startled me was the scene where caiaphas told jesus about pilate \"and don\\'t ever forget, that you are a jew!\" though that may have not been a racist remark,colin blakely was trying to make chris sarandon look like garbage in the eyes of the prominent men of those days.keith michell\\'s portrayal of pilate was hulking, comparing with his previous performances in \"the story of jacob and joseph\" and \"the story of david\". but if you compare his portrayal of pilate with telly savala\\'s or hurd hatfield, you can say that he really painted well the impression of a roman procurator. when i was young, i was a big fan of the naked gun movies but just recently i watched the show police sqaud! and i think its great! leslie nielson\\'s awesome, alan north is cool, and who the heck is rex hamilton? but anyways, it\\'s one goofy show. one of my favorite parts of this show when they do the freeze frame scene during the end credits. i think my favorite one is when norberg (not o.j.) walks in during the scene and he tries to fit in with the freeze frame. classic! the only problem to me is the cigarette gag gets very old (when drebin shows a cigarette to someone and asks, \"cigarette?\" and the person replies, \"yes. i know.\") i think they used it too many times by whatever. good acting, good gags, great show! 7/10 within about 5 minutes in to the film the first fight scene i was watching i just could help but pointout the lack of tension in the scene the cameras crossing back and forth really shows he had no idea what he was doing, well actually the soundtrack shows that the best. i no its a low budget film and your not going to get top 40 songs but at least get music that goes with the scene that isn\\'t actually that hard acting, well if i saw any i would gladly let you know. the script was so badly written would now surprise me one bit of the guy directing wrote this piece of beep, i will give the person one 10/10 and that was for the dvd cover because if i actually saw \"before watching this\" in a shop and it was like 10 15 bucks i would have bought it, why well if you look at the front cover this actually well done you flip over to the back and you see that it has actually won awards. now that is a very misleading thing because even in a small film festival i wouldn\\'t ever believe in my life that this would win anything all i can say is \"wow if this was the best i wouldn\\'t want to know what the crap in the film festival was like\" films that are this bad only have one good use and that is for a aspiring film maker to use as inspiration films like this are better tools then good films, because with good film you almost know off the bat there is a good chance you wont make a film that good, but if you use a film like this you can look at all the things they director or writer did wrong so you wont make the same mistakes, and you have the added plus of looking at this film and saying if a piece of beep like this can get made then there is hope of anyone out there i must say that i really had no idea that i was going to sit down and watch this movie. i guess it was the fact that i had nothing better to do between class. but, for once a tv movie caught my interest. more importantly helen hunt caught my eye. i really wasn\\'t a big fan of hers prior to this film. sure i liked twister and as good as it gets. but, something about this movie really did it for me. i would now see myself as a huge fan. this movie comes with high marks from...me. give it a chance, it won\\'t let you down. my mother worked with dennis l. raider for eleven years, not to mention shared an office with him. when it was announced he was btk, she was shocked. the whole day was just her telling stories about how she never would have seen him as the wichita killer. i\\'ve heard her re-tell them many times. i\\'ve inquired her about a lot of things, and gone to all the interviews that she was asked to go to. i\\'ve read the entire book written about raider, wichita is my hometown and i was surprised that such a thing could happen in kansas. there was another btk movie on tv not too long ago, and i thought this one would have been better at portraying dennis\\' killings, maybe even have some intelligent touches to his motives. i\\'m going to be very blunt with the flaws in this movie. this is based on my mom\\'s portrayal of him, all my readings on him, and the video tapes i\\'ve seen of him talking. first of all, the camera angles were horrible. it looked as though it had been shot on a home video camera. the acting was terrible and i couldn\\'t even bear to watch it. dennis raider never had long hair. dennis raider was a \"very anal man\" and was a \"follow the rule book\" kind of guy. he wasn\\'t as nice as the movie made him look, he was very polite and abrupt, business like. same goes for his killings, as far as we all know. if you\\'ve seen his confession in court, you can already guess. and as for the obsession with the slaughter house? no. never have i read or has dennis raider confessed to having a problem with animal cruelty or people squishing bugs. in fact, he practiced on cats and dogs for choking methods. yet through-out the whole movie he was putting animals in his victim\\'s faces and acting like he cared about the well-being of them. dennis raider never killed the people that he knew, he confessed this, but in the movie in his first killing he tells the lady he knows her also. i really don\\'t even want to go in to this movie, and i\\'m already ranting. this is not what you want to watch if you are interested in the actual happenings of btk. this is not what you want to watch if you want a good horror movie. if you want a badly shot half-porno with some slaughter scenes served the side, then this is your kind of movie. if you thought that the original from 83 was bad then try out this modern day masterpiece. how could it be worse more you ask? well...at least in the first one you had ally sheedy jogging in a sports bra. other than updated graphics, modern day themes (such as terrorists), modern weapons and a sexy new voice for ripley unfortunately this is the same sad tired story. anyone that saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene / line in the story was going. and for anyone that didn\\'t see the first one...well consider yourself lucky that you only watched it once. maybe in another 23 years hollywood will try again. haunted boat sells itself as \\'the fog\\' meets \\'open water\\'. in many ways this is accurate. there are scares and weird looking people to keep you interested. however the acting ability is poor at best. showing clear signs that this is merely a bunch of friends making a horror film. which in all credit they do to the best of their ability. when you accept the low budget makes it very difficult for special effects, with the ghosts looking pretty much like men with rubber masks on. many aspects of the film are creepy and strange. but it suffers for using too many twists and turns in a short space of time which just leaves you bored and confused. in terms of keeping you awake the film does it very well. ignoring the irrelevant twisting every 5 seconds near the end, you actually want to know what is going on. and are willing to wait the 1hr 35 minutes for the climax. this is no ghost ship but it\\'ll definitely do for an evening in front of the t.v. i rented this type of \"soft core\" before, but i can honestly say, i wasn\\'t expecting this to be in the same type as \"rod steele: you only live until you die\"--which was both sexy and funny. it had a good script, a sincere leading man, and a sense of purpose. it also has gabriella hall who is hot. the reason why i didn\\'t expect this movie, was because the box was missing the \"must be 18 to rent\" sticker. i was looking for more \"cheese\" and less \"cheesecake.\" first of all, i think movies shouldn\\'t be allowed to start with \"actors\" rehearsing for a part at a talent agency (or wherever \"actors\" rehearse). in this movies seeing the \"actors\" rehearsing highlights the lack of preparation that went into acting out the real characters in the movie. okay, having found out that this was a soft core movie, i didn\\'t necessarily turn it off and demand my money back. but, the dizzying way the extended video \"erotic\" scenes are added to what was probably a late night pay-cable release are very annoying and easy to fast-forward through without the sustained quality of, say, rod steele. you know they must\\'ve had some money, because i think some of it is filmed overseas. i will have to say the main actor trying not to spill the invisibility potion on himself is one of the most baffling acting jobs i\\'ve ever seen. and, i\\'ve seen torgo from manos! it may actually have been worth the dollar rental fee (that and gabriella hall). still, there are better corny movies to rent with your friends. i watched this movie based on the comments of a few that said that is was bad but funny. but you need to be warned that this movie has the worst special effects ever produced. they make 1950s science fiction movies look like works of art. this is funny at times, but annoying for the most part. and to compound the problem with the seriously pathetic special effects is the total lack of logic that characterized a majority of the events depicted. one of my favorites is where three of the characters drop hundreds of feet into a tunnel created by the arachnia and arrive to find it fully lit. apparantely the arachnia have also managed to hook into the power grid. very impressive. but this is just one example. and for what its worth, the music sucks, the acting sucks, the two cute girls are annoying, the obnoxious guy is annoying, the so-called handsome lead man is a geek, and the black girl who fall for him is a fool. her father is the worst actor i have ever seen. i am not sure the brief moments of humor can possibly make up for the experience. i must say: out of all modern korean martial arts movies this one is worth checking out. it wasn\\'t as epic as musa-the warriors and didn\\'t develop the characters as well, but it had many nice ideas. simple story: a elite soldier thought dead, returns after years to end the reign of the japanese in korea in medieval days. his counterpart was formerly the best friend he had and now he is out to stop him. the fight scenes are all with sword or different weapons and very entertaining to watch. the motives of the figures are discovered first near to the end. you might need to watch it again to get all the connections right. and me personally...i loved the end. i could watch it over and over again. maybe a little pathetic, but a real freedom fighter story.... people can be killed, but not the ideas they stand for.... this is a movie that plays to everyone\\'s emotions. we all want a second chance at things. jim morris got one, followed his heart and got a chance to live his dream. what a great message and what a great delivery by this movie. \"zu:the warriors from magic mountain\" was and is an impressive classic! you never would have guessed it was made in 1983. tsui hark\\'s use of special effects was very creative and inventive. (he continued doing this in the chinese ghost story trilogy and later productions.) even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre. \"legend of zu\" is connected to \"zu\"warriors from magic mountain\"! it is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one. the plot is a bit hard to follow. but to be honest it doesn\\'t matter. it is all about the action and adventure! i always was wondering what tsui hark would do if he got his hands on cgi. now we know,he made this movie. maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that i am not going to be critical about that. there is so much happening on the screen,you simply won\\'t believe! i think it is a big shame that this movie wasn\\'t shown in theaters here in holland. because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas! this movie easily can beat big budget hollywood productions like \"superman returns\" or xmen 3. the only thing i do have to mention is the lack of humor! in most of tsui harks\\'s movies he combines drama,fantasy,martial arts and humor. somehow it is missing in this movie. again i am not going to be picky about these small matters. \"legend of zu\" delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see. a true classic! one of my favorite shows in the 80\\'s. after the first season, it started going downhill when they decided to add jean bruce scott to the cast. deborah pratt was wonderful and it was fun watching her and ernest borgnine\\'s character go at it with each other. the last episode she appeared in was one of my favorites for in the second season. unfortunately during those days, blacks did not last long on television shows. some of the episodes in the second season where okay but the third season it was more about the human characters than airwolf and it was not shown until almost at the end of the show. when it went to usa, it was disgusting!!! i picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie. but i had no idea what i was getting myself into. i started the movie and soon i had been pulled into a world of pain and visual torture. i finally know what hell is like. it\\'s this movie. for eternity. this movie has no value. it didn\\'t even really have a plot. there was stuff going on in each scene but no overall explanation why anything happens. instead of watching this movie i suggest that you line the nearest blender with oil and try and stuff as many bullets in it as you can. you will find that the outcome to be far more pleasant than this movie. don\\'t even watch it. not even to see how bad it is. i beg you. if you watch it, then it means they win. after we counted the use of the f word, oh, about 22 times in the first 10 minutes or so of the film, listened to some really bad actors going on about a woman and a horse, and pretty much acting like 12 year old boys being naughty together, well, we turned it off. relying on gratuitous profanity and potty humor is a sure sign of a loser hollywood movie, the product of unimaginative and no-talent writers. we did give it a second chance, thinking surely it would get better. no dice. later, my boyfriend skipped through the rest of the movie in case it improved, still no dice. the main character did have a cool bike. i wouldn\\'t recommend this to anyone except maybe really immature adolescents, or frat boys. a real head scratcher of a film by bill rebane who appeared to be getting worse in his trade throughout the eighties. three crackpot millionaires invite nine people to a remote hotel to compete in a last person standing contest in which the final contestant will be given $1 million provided he or she makes it that far. a series of lame pranks are pulled on some of the guests while the others engage in what most adults would do under the circumstances namely get shatfaced at the hotel bar. most scenes are merely an excuse to focus the camera on various female body parts including an opening dance number that is a crossover of american bandstand meets geriatric aerobics complete with hookers. if there was any hesitation that white people can\\'t dance this scene hammers the final nail in that coffin. pay close attention for the nipple slip. this continues on for about forty-five minutes until bill rebane begins throwing darts at various plot twists and whatever he hits becomes the inspiration for the next scene making this one incoherent mess. it\\'s a game until it\\'s not a game. the three old coots are in complete control until they\\'re not. the hotel is possessed by a supernatural force until it becomes just props. they\\'re dead until they\\'re not. even the narrator at the end replies that he doesn\\'t know what the hell happened. i defy anyone to reason where rebane was going on this one. the acting is dinner theater caliber minus the dinner. most of the actors probably went back to their day jobs at the local stuckey\\'s. i give it a few points for the scene where the yuppie broad opens the closet and a skeleton is inside skull humping himself. let\\'s see gone with the wind do that! this chilling classics collection is really becoming the bane of me. bane, get it! like rebane! i hate myself. this movie is not porn, it was not meant to be porn, and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered porn. now that that issue was sorted out, i can say i thoroughly recommend this film, as it\\'s issues are still widely available. it\\'s funny, the acting is great and it raises serious(curious) questions. i can\\'t fully understand why this film was so mistreated, probably this is why i plan to never visit the us. lena is the true pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement, confusion, curiosity and wit are her main attributes, she is occasionally angry, but aren\\'t we all? komodo vs. cobra starts as \\'one planet\\' environmentalist jerry ryan (ryan mctavish) & his girlfriend carrie (renee talbert) hire captain michael stoddard (executive producer michael parã©) to take them to an island in the south pacific, at first stoddard is reluctant since the island is a top secret military research base but soon changes his mind when a load of cash is offered. along with tv news reporter sandra crescent (jeri manthey) they set sail for the island & once ashore find out that the military have been funding illegal dna genetic experiments which have resulted in huge komodo dragon\\'s & king cobra\\'s that have eaten almost every other living thing there & stoddard & co are next on the menu... co-written & directed by the ever awful jim wynorski under his jay andrews pseudonym this is just plain awful, this is just plain hard to sit through & is even worse than the usual rubbish \\'creature features\\' the sci-fi channel have the nerve to air if that\\'s possible. the script is terrible, predictable & utterly boring, some giant monsters of some sort are created by scientists messing around with dna, a group of people are trapped with said monsters & have to try to escape being eaten. that\\'s it, that\\'s the whole plot of komodo vs. cobra, maybe this was trying to rip-off avp: alien vs. predator (2004) with the title but all the \\'vs.\\' bit amounts to is a rubbish thirty second stand-off between the two titular beasts at the very end, boring as hell & surely a big disappointment to anyone hoping to have a full on monster mash. the character\\'s are poor, the dialogue is awful, the pace is slow, the story is predictable & clichã© ridden & the whole film just sucks really with a lazy script that states wrongly that both komodo dragon\\'s & cobra\\'s are amphibious which they are not. hell, komodo vs. cobra isn\\'t even worth watching for any unintentional laughs since it\\'s so dull & hardly anything ever happens although the sight of a woman hiding behind the smallest rock on the beach from the cobra is quite funny for the wrong reasons. how does wynorski keep getting directing jobs? he is probably consistently the worst director currently working, how can he keep getting fun sounding films set on beautiful locations with half decent casts & still churn out such an awful film? i think this was cut to get a pg or for it\\'s tv showing since every time someone swears it\\'s masked by a parrot squeak! there\\'s zero gore or violence & the monster scenes are limp, people just sort of stand there, the monsters just sort of stands there too hissing or roaring & that\\'s about it. the cgi computer effects are terrible, this is really poor stuff that just looks horrible. with a supposed budget of about $450,000 this looks as cheap as it was, the hawaiian locations are nice to look at but that\\'s about it. the acting is poor from an uninterested looking cast. komodo vs. cobra is an absolutely terrible sci-fi channel \\'creature feature\\' from jim wynorski, films don\\'t get much worse than this. this review may contain spoilers! the decline of western civilization......what a great title eh? and of coarse a great movie. this is the best concert film i have ever seen. a close second being the talking heads movie \"stop making sense\". i first heard of this movie when waynes world came out in 1992. i looked at the director\\'s name penelope spheeris and thought cool name, what else has he directed? i thought the first name was pronounced like envelope. after some time looking in movie guides i came across the critically acclaimed decline and realized penelope was a woman.....my mom corrected me. i spent 8 years of my life trying to track this down. i finally saw it on vhs in vancouver, where i currently reside. it was worth the wait. this captures the la punk movement very well. this is teen angst at it\\'s best folks. my favourite is the band the germs who need subtitles for the lyrics because darby crash sings so crazy, you cannot understand it. i laughed when i saw this. the band black flag live in an abandoned church and the band x are a very intelligent bunch. also laughed at the letter some idiot writes in to slash magazine about how we do not need to save the whales, there are countless miles of ocean for us to pour toxins in! i became a huge penelope spheeris fan after this, and saw all her punk movies-dudes was ok, and suburbia is a cult classic! i own both of these on vhs. she is a true underground film maker and i love her stuff. i would have loved to have seen this movie in 1994 when grunge was so popular. i was a big nirvana fan then, but alas i saw this in 2002 and by that point i had grown out of grunge and now i listen to crystal method/fatboy slim. quite a change of pace, i know, but what can you do? but if you want a true depiction of the punk movement this captures it better than anything. much better than 1991: the year punk broke. this is a tough movie to track down, but if you get your hands on it, rent it, even if you don\\'t like the music it is an excellent piece of work. now days it might be easier to find with dvd\\'s being so popular. by the way penelope produced a little known albert brooks movie called \"real life\" which i also own. very funny stuff in todays reality tv craptacular! rent decline......highly recommended! thanks! i don\\'t have much to say about this movie. it could have been a wonderful tour-de-force for peter sellers, but it is one of the most tragic misfires in movie history. that it was sellers final movie makes it all the more painful. the terrible screenplay, direction and shockingly wooden performances all come dreadfully together to make this one of the most unwatchably awful movies ever made. i wish so much that i could find even a snicker or a chuckle buried somewhere in this pile of putrid blubber, but it\\'s a lifeless, humorless disaster. the truth hurts. peter, why couldn\\'t you have stopped at being there? remember the wooden, undramatic literary adaptations of the 1970s at their worst? you will when you see this broadly acted, unintentionally hilarious piece of chocolate-box adaptation. most culpable of all is catherine z-j who, while undeniably easy on the eye, substitutes swishing a big dress and looking sultry for actually turning in a performance. played po-faced like a melodrama, or cold comfort farm without the jokes, this effort is not helped by a scriptwriter with a tin ear for dialogue who misses entirely the novel\\'s sense of irony or tragedy. a shame, given the quality of the acting talent on offer - joan plowright, claire skinner, steven macintosh all deserve better than this. obviously, the comments above that fawn over the movie were made by someone who\\'s on the crew. i don\\'t recall ever seeing a movie that\\'s more insulting to the talented actors or the audience watching. in my 30 years of watching movies, this is the only one i have ever walked out of. bad humor, bad jokes, bad gags, bad editing, bad plot, etc. note to producer: it\\'s never funny to hunt humans based on race. great that you tried to be politically correct by incorporating all races, but you\\'re still hunting humans based on race, and that\\'s sickening. best movie ever!!!!! this movie broke my ribs just by the force of laughter, but it was well worth it. i don\\'t intend to do a summary of this excellent movie, just go see it if you have the chance. i think you will either love it, or hate it. that\\'s the qualities of a real cult movie. oh, how we have a misfire here; a film so bad that your mind will wonder and drift away onto other things as it wastes your time with brain numbingly poor production values; character stereotypes of the worst and racist kind since d.w. griffith referred to the chinese character in broken blossoms as \\'the yellow man\\'; characters so unimaginative and un-engaging that it\\'s difficult to watch as well as a narrative that plods along at such a slow, stupid and pointless pace that you will question the very people who say they like this film. prizzi\\'s honor is a film that ends up being an absolute post-modern disaster in every which way possible. the film is a messy and senseless disaster that has john huston directing; kathleen turner and jack nicholson staring and everybody else filling in the gaps as either dumb stereotypes or supporting characters that weep on a phone now and again or bicker with a main character. prizzi\\'s honor is a film that falls into a genre of neo-noir, comedy, romance, action, gangster and overall crime â– this twinned with its director and cast should be enough to propel it through some sort of a story; some sort of a sequence of good scenes; some sort of intelligence in the form of a screenplay or something else but no â– what we get is a nasty and ugly film revolving around nothing at all. i\\'ll give a couple of examples of how shoddy this horror show of a film actually is. firstly, the film thinks it\\'s a love story and it thinks this for about an hour of its time: of my time. charley partanna (nicholson) is an assassin who kills people for a family that he works for in new york and yet he resembles his character out of one flew over the cuckoo\\'s nest more than an international hit-man. he meets and falls in love with irene walker (turner) who is another assassin and they hit it off but as the poor excuse for a plot plays out, it appears all is not right. i read that the plot for this film is: \"a professional hit man and hit woman fall in love, only to discover that they have each been hired to kill the other.\" well, yes that\\'s true but that actual revelation doesn\\'t happen until about twenty minutes to the end! nicholson plays partanna like someone with an iq of 60: he walks around; seemingly making observations and talking out loud about things he sees; he talks like he is either drunk or has a more serious problem from within and worse of all we never get the feeling he is an assassin â– one really poorly shot assassination early on (that actually happens off screen) is not enough to suggest this guy is a hard-bodied, best of the best, international hit-man. so with a main character who is un-likable and un-realistic, we move to the script. the first hour and a half is just a cinematic dead zone with what ever there is to suggest traces of life merely poor conventions: partanna slouches around on the phone or in person asking the same things over and over again: \"do i marry her?; do i love her? what is love? what do i do?\" and it gets so repetitive, it\\'s not even able to act as good humour. this twinned with the way he always seemed to be on the phone to someone: a girl called maerose prizzi (huston) played by director john\\'s daughter; which served absolutely no purpose to the plot whatsoever and seemed to be there for laughs as was the scene in which she tells her father about how she slept with partanna and loved it â– that got me thinking, was this supposed to be funny? should i be laughing? the film felt like a smart mafia picture what with its opening scene of a wedding (alã¡ the godfather) and consequential scenes with a touch of noir as gangsters, police men and assassins were introduced into the film. but what we get is something very, very different. the second hour revolves around some sort of a kidnap plot; right, the love and romance is dealt with â– maybe the film will kick-start. i was so very wrong: with more characters continuously talking very slowly and very deliberately in a monotone way, we have a kidnap scene involving some guy coming out of his office: this scene sums the film up. everything is briefly planned and then executed in a heavy handed and dumb way that just makes it look cheesy. we do not get to see them arrive to some dramatic music; perhaps they have to get through security to get to the elevators; maybe they have to be careful of civilians when they hide in their chosen places and when that random woman steps out of the elevator and the gunshot occurs â– the scene isn\\'t even edited correctly. some suspense, some drama: \"do i shoot or don\\'t i?\"; maybe some slow motion as the character has to quick draw before it\\'s too late â– anything but how it was actually executed. prizzi\\'s honor continues its monotonous and uninteresting decent into filmic oblivion as it nears its climax. it\\'s a film where cameras reflect in windows; lights reflect in sides of cars and \\'dead\\' chauffeurs blink when nudged. prizzi\\'s honor is a jumbled and messy film that will try the patients of any film-goer and don\\'t say it was a comedy because i didn\\'t laugh with it â– at it is another matter. the film is repetitive, drawn out and colourless in its vision and scope for originality - there is no honour here. the original movie ( dated 19??)did not show any \"monster\" , it just suggested scary \"things\" , . this version however shows every aspect of a \"sick minded ghost\" , including unnecessary special effects . the \"mystery \" ,as presented in the original movie , was the most scary part : one simply did not know what was causing the weird things that happened. by showing the face of the \"old man\" , this mister has completely disappeared. even worse : the special effects ( crying wooden children faces) is ridiculous. this is a stupid remake , too obviously spectacular to even be close as scary as the original \"hero and the terror\" is a fairly dull thriller - a la: no real character substance, predictable plot, and... boring. for a thriller i found this movie slow in working up to its pitiful climax, as it just seemed to drag along until chuck\\'s wife\\'s baby is born... and then it drags on from there until it reaches the end - which i can hardly remember already even though i only saw the film 10 minutes ago. i give this film 3 out of 10 - for the first 10-20 minutes. fellowe\\'s drama about a couple\\'s marriage which is threatened by a younger third party which interests the wife of the house (watson). wilkinson plays the role very well as the troubled husband who cant control his wife\\'s cheating, and deals with the issue. i also like rupert everett a lot in his role as william bule, the man that watson has the affair with. although i think emily watson is a great actress, i had a bit of a problem with the way her character was written, did not make her too likable (i know a cheater is not supposed to be likable, but some of her actions and things she did had no reasoning behind them). the screenplay was perhaps the weak part of this drama, although fellowes\\' direction was good and the performances were also quite good. this film is better than unfaithful, but not a masterpiece by any means. ---imdb rating: 6.7, my rating: 8/10 an angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is looked after by his grandfather. together they find common ground in the gaelic folk tales which have been passed down orally from generation to generation of islanders. although tragic episodes, such as the highland clearances, feature in the stories, there is a surprising amount of humour and gaiety in them. it\\'s all filmed in skye, so there is a double dose of beauty. the mountain scenery is breathtaking, and it\\'s a rare chance to hear scottish gaelic spoken. i\\'m english, so i had to read the subtitles, but the sound of spoken gaelic is nonetheless wonderful. the performances are just what you would expect from carefully chosen non-actors - in other words, you are watching the real thing - people who care deeply about gaelic folklore and history. the gaelic community, especially on skye, worked innumerable minor miracles to make this film. anyone who has the slightest interest in gaelic, folk history, folk music, oral culture, scotland, british history, multi-culturalism or social justice should go and see this film. there is absolutely no reason to waste your time with this \"film\". the original said it all and still holds up. either read the book or do some research about the story, and you\\'ll realize this remake is ludicrous. eric roberts as perry smith? his sister could have done a better job! having been to holcomb & edgerton, ks where the story takes place, the sets and locations looked nothing like kansas. the original is riveting, from the location filming to the use of the actual participants, weapons and victims belongings. unforgettable performances by scott wilson and robert blake. soundtrack by quincy jones and cinematography by conrad hall...the original is available on dvd in widescreen now. let this turkey die a quick death. as far as cinematography goes, this film was pretty good for the mid 50\\'s. there were a few times that the lighting was way too hot but the shots were generally in frame and stayed in focus. the acting was above average for a low budget stinker but the direction was horrible. several scenes were dragged out way too long in an attempt at suspense and the effects were non-existent. the attack by the skull in the pond should have been completely removed from the final cut and every attempt to bring life to the skull was obvious with stick pokes and strings. i also couldn\\'t help but think the budget didn\\'t allow them to furnish the house so they kept making references to the movers and that all the things in storage should be coming soon. honestly...it would have been more entertaining if it were a worse movie. it wasn\\'t bad enough to be a \"good-bad\" movie but wasn\\'t good enough to be \"good\" either. get the mst3k version...it\\'s more fun. my favourite police series of all time turns to a tv-film. does it work? yes. gee runs for mayor and gets shot. the homicide \"hall of fame\" turns up. pembleton and nearly all of the cops who ever played in this series. a lot of flashbacks helps you who hasnâ´t seen the tv-series but it amuses the fans too. the last five minutes solves another murder and at the very end even two of the dead cops turn up. and a short appearance from my favourite coroner juliana cox. this is a good film. ok, maybe posse can\\'t compare to other popular cowboy/western movies. but that\\'s because it didn\\'t have the funding those movies had. obviously, whenever you want to produce a story such as this one, focusing on african american historical involvement (and no, servants and \\'mammies\\' are not historical involvement), hollywood isn\\'t going to be too supportive. and believe me they weren\\'t. the producers and actors sacrificed a lot of \\'out of pocket\\' expenses to make \"posse\", just so that the story could be told. i think that alone is commendable. posse may not be oscar material (and they don\\'t like black media too much either), but it is a start. it is entertaining, and it introduces us to the black cowboy, a character most of us are unfamiliar with. i must say that i am fairly disappointed by this \"horror\" movie. i did not get scared even once while watching it. it also is not very suspenseful either.... i was able to guess the ending half way through the movie... so.. what\\'s left? \"the ring\" is a trully scary movie... i wish other movies would stop copying from it (e.g. the trade-mark: long hair). please give me some originality. will not recommend this movie. i truly enjoyed this film. it\\'s rare to find a star who can pull off the physical aspects of any sports/dance themed film convincingly and do a first rate acting job as well. in this film you find two stars who rise to the occasion. both women deliver warm, touching and at times humorous performances. the film also touched on a number of topics, from racial issues to sexual identity. and yet the approach wasn\\'t heavy handed. the production values were also top notch for a small budget film. i saw this at the philadelphia gay & lesbian film festival and went back to see it a second time. it was a real crowd pleaser. everyone i spoke to seemed to enjoy this film. lucio fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a bucket load of gore lead to him earning the title \\'the godfather of gore\\'. while don\\'t torture a duckling was made before fulci became well known amongst gorehounds, and isn\\'t all that gory; it\\'s certainly a gritty and nasty little thriller, and for my money - the best film that fulci ever made! don\\'t torture a duckling really is head and shoulders above a lot of the giallo genre in terms of production values and unlike many of fulci\\'s later films, everything about this giallo is great. the plot focuses on a small rustic community where dead bodies have began turning up. the murders are even more shocking because the victims are just young boys. shortly after the police convict an innocent man of the crimes, a reporter named andrea martelli arrives in the village and decides to start investigating the murders on his own. martelli soon encounters various suspects, including a sexy young lady named patricia, a sinister priest and a local witch who enjoys making wax effigies and sticking pins into them. while this film may not feature loads of gore, it does have two of fulci\\'s nastiest sequences to make up for it. the nastiest involves a woman being brutally slaughtered by a group of men in a cemetery, while the image of a man falling from a cliff and hitting any number of rocks on the way down is liable to turn some stomachs. don\\'t torture a duckling features an absolutely great italian cast. barbara bouchet (a personal favourite of mine) is incredibly sexy in her role as patricia, and gets to flex her acting muscles more than she did in many later films. tomas millian is excellent as usual while the rest of the cast is well fleshed out by likes of irene pappas, florinda bolkan and marc porel. the cinematography on display is stunning and fulci really gives the viewer the impression that he puts a lot of care and effort into every scene. the story plays out slowly, and it\\'s always interesting as fulci never allows the film to stray too much from the central plot line. there isn\\'t a great deal of mystery towards the identity of the murderer; but fulci almost manages to keep us guessing right up until the end and don\\'t torture a duckling does climax on a high. overall, it\\'s a shame that fulci didn\\'t make more films like this. don\\'t torture a duckling is his out and out best work and i insist that every giallo fans sees it! this could have been a good biopic, but what a mess! i had this film when i was a theater manager. when i put the film together, and watched it, i thought i had some reels out of order. as it turned out i didn\\'t, and if i did, nobody would have noticed. i couldn\\'t figure out what\\'s going on! everybody who walked out pretty much felt the same way! the white warrior is definitely one of,if not steve reeves weakest films. set in 18th or 19th century russia (??) steve plays a cossack warrior who tries to over run a mad man russian czar by running up a mountain side with his rebel band in a goofy looking russian white tunic..... for the most part the great reeves physique is hidden in a goofy, knee length tunic, with an even more sillier looking russian hat. the action is rather minimal, with only a good wrestling scene from the mid waist up that shows off the great reeves physique. this is an apparent attempt by the producers to move reeves out of the sword and sandal genre into another historic era, with poor results. the dialogue from the script is hard to understand at various points, and only commentary from the narrator allows the viewer to understand what is really happening from scene to scene. i would image reeves regretted making this film, but in an attempt to try and get out of his toga and sandals and tribune armor it helped launch him to other historic characters such as morgan the pirate and the thief of baghdad. if the makers of atlantis had something to say in this film, its theme was (literally) drowned out by the emphasis on \"special effects\" over characterization. almost as if in an attempt to \"keep up\" with the rest of the summer action blockbusters, disney has ditched the character-driven, movie-with-a-message approach in favor of a star wars \"shoot-\\'em-up\" with stereotype heroes and villains. the art is cartoony and the producers think that they can rely on computer generated images (cgi) of flying fish-craft and submarines to fill the gap. they are wrong, and the days of beautiful, handcrafted animation is fast flying out the window in favor of assembly-line cgi. this movie is all spectacle with no heart. at times the film comes close to being a good, worthwhile movie, but frustratingly misses the mark so many times by copping out of talking about something meaningful and instead choosing to go with the glitz. another problem with the movie is the pacing. it starts confusingly and then begins to rocket along with a choppy story editing style that is not appreciated. the viewer is rushed out of the door along with milo thatch (voiced well by michael j. fox) and is left thinking \"gee there must be an awful lot of stuff that\\'s going to happen once we get to atlantis\". unfortunately, not much happens. the secret of atlantis remains a secret with the story-tellers not really knowing how to explain the legendary island/continent. they are afraid to commit to saying where atlantis is, even in a fictional story. is it in the atlantic? is it in the mediterranean sea? who knows? nothing is hypothesized, even from a purely fantasy-based point of view. the viewer will leave the theatre asking themselves \"now what was that all about? what was the point of the movie? why couldn\\'t the surviving atlantean\\'s remember how to read when many of them lived through the disaster to the \"present\" day? and why did atlantis sink?\" and then promptly begin to forget about what they saw. there is nothing left to think about or mill over... except the loss of money in their wallets. the characters and their motivations are equally unfathomable. from the eccentric zillionaire who founds the expedition with seemingly more money that existed on the entire planet in 1914, to the (spoiler) collective consciousness that enters kida and voluntarily deserts its people!?! the crew are a collection of quirky, 2-dimensional people of anachronistically (for 1914) p.c. race and gender. the demolitions expert talks like he came right out of a warner brothers\\' bugs bunny short. most of the jokes are gross one-liners that are largely missed by the audience for two reasons: they are delivered at lightning-speed pacing and usually mumbled. the way these supporting players do a moral turn-around near the end of the movie is hard to believe. while we applaud disney for trying to create animated movies for adults - and this is the first disney not to have cute, talking animals or objects - it fails to make the transition. younger children will be frightened by some of the action scenes and be left in the dark by the large amount of subtitles (when the characters speak atlantean). in the first five minutes of the expedition, approximately 200 people are killed without a second thought. obviously disney thinks that if you didn\\'t know who those people were, then why should you care? again, the movie has no feelings on any level. mulan and tarzan were the last animated movies produced by disney that were done extremely well. sadly, atlantis harkens back to those failed attempts in the past such as the black cauldron and hunchback of notre dame. disney needs to get back to their roots. a sequel to peter pan is coming out shortly but one never knows what the results will be until you see it for yourself. and now that disney has discovered science fiction one hopes that they will realize that that genre must have more than spectacle to it. we also hope that the upcoming \"treasure planet\", a sci-fi adaptation of robert l. stevenson\\'s \"treasure island\", will have more heart to it than the unfathomable \"atlantis: the lost empire\". bruce almighty is the story of bruce nolan, an average man who feels god is messing up his life. god confronts him and show bruce the error of his ways. of course, giving someone god\\'s powers could take a turn for the worse. bruce almighty is a good comedy, jim carrey is good, as always morgan freeman is first-rate and seems right at home as god and the cast brings the plot together well. the jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they resort a bit too much on carrey\\'s facial expressions. i liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed god, not only that but also as a black man. i thought this quite well, especially with the brilliant freeman. there are some hilarious scenes, the opening cookie scene for instance, others miss the target slightly but still a good film. 6/7 out of 10 this film was hard to get a hold of, and when i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming. i mean, this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century: an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and gets away with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt. with all of this built-in interest, how could anyone make such a lackluster, talk-laden flick of this true-life event. while williams is always interesting, the screenwriters assumed that the d.b. cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star, s what we get is a type-without any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off. harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty, but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction. shame on this film for even existing. i just watched this film this morning and i found it to be a great showing of the richness of faith. babette gave them another way to look at life; not a replacement, but an enhancement. she shared all that she had with those who gave what little they had to her. i see the story of god in here. he sent his only son to man. man could not possibly give anything that would equal that. so, for our small sacrifice, we are given an ultimate treasure and are transformed because of it. in this film the bickering townspeople have so consumed themselves with a small interpretation of god. babette showed them that life and god can indeed be beautiful in it\\'s fullest sense. the love that god\\'s son showed to man is the love we should show to one another and our lives will be the richer for it. even the film is a metaphor. it seems slow in the beginning, but the investment of time and attention to detail is rewarded in the end. it was truly a feast. with this film being directed by roger avery and quentin tarantino doing the screenplay i was sure this was going to be a gem. i was wrong. i don\\'t hate this film but in no ways do i like it. i love roger avery because of his amazing direction in rules of attraction and his screenplays to pulp fiction and silent hill but he made a mistake making this. do i really need to comment on tarantino, we all know hes a genius. this movie is just set around a gang robbing a bank but fails due to silly people participating in the robbery i\\'m disappointed in tarantino and avery for doing this film but doesn\\'t change my mind on how amazing they both are. everyone makes mistakes......... 3/10...........j.d seaton funny. sad. charming. these are all words that floated through my head while i was watching this beautiful, simple film. it is rare that a movie truly moves me, but \"shall we dance?\" accomplished that with grace to spare. gentle humor mixed in with occasional subtle agony made this easily one of the best experiences of my movie-viewing history. it left me with a quiet sense of exultation, but with a small touch of sadness mixed in. and the dancing, oh yes, the dancing. even if you are not a lover of the art, or can\\'t put one foot in front of another, the steps displayed here will take your breath away, and make you want to sign up for classes as fast as you can. it was absolutely enchanting, even the parts that show sugiyama\\'s (touchingly portrayed by koji yakusho) stilted steps when he was first learning to dance were lovely in a humorous, child-like way. and yet, this film was not entirely about dancing, but more about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings. we witness a shy man learning to express his repressed feelings through dance, a beautiful dance instructor rediscovering her love for the art, and the personal growth of every member of the wonderful supporting cast. beauty. pain. emotion. all the love and little agonies of life are here, expressed with the delicate feeling of a fine japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional strength and grace of the culture. justin goes home to live with his strict, hard-nosed police detective father, but it seems daddy has turned the upstairs into three makeshift apartments each with bizarre tenants residing in them. straight-laced idealist justin is thrust into the world of the occult, murder, under-aged drinking and other dastardly things. ho-hum wow, have i seen the same film that nearly all the other reviewers on here saw??? clever, compelling, original, intense, clever, genius????!!? i witnessed none of those things. what i did see was an uninteresting, bland, trite, extremely clichã©d low-budget thriller that was ripe with implausibilities and no tension in the least bit as the killer is telegraphed as soon into the film as he gives his monologue/debate/discussion. and where are these humorous laugh-out-loud moments? i never so much as chuckled, perhaps because i was too busy struggling not to be put to sleep by the film. my grade: d dvd extras: audio commentary with director dave campfield; second commentary with various contributers as well as isolated music tracks; 4 featurettes (making of, on the set, turning 1 room into 4, & inside the black circle); interviews with felissa rose, desiree gould, & raine brown; alternate scenes; bloopers; a music video for \\'addiction\\'; a trailer for this movie; and trailers for \"shock-o-rama\", \"chainsaw sally\", \"skin crawl\", \"sinful\", \"bacterium\", \"creature from the hillbilly lagoon\", & \"millennium crises\" the above line sums it up pretty good. the best assets of the comics are it\\'s visual gags and word-jokes (the latter of which are almost impossible to translate, which is why the comics are at their best in their original language). both are quite hard to capture in film, which is why those will never be as good as the comics. movies are simply a different medium than comics. with that in mind, this movie does surprisingly well in capturing the fun of the comic. the word gags are bearable, and sometimes even funny (debouze does an amelie reference!). i have to mention that i watched the french version. if you don\\'t watch the french version or your lack of understanding of the french language limits you to the subtitles, the word jokes will probably suck. the slapstick is okay as well; it\\'s a very simple form of humor, and not really funny when you\\'re older than twelve, but it captures the spirit of the comicbooks. the other visual jokes are the movie\\'s saving grace for the older audience, as their often quite funny. the acting is totally over the top, but again, that\\'s not annoying at all as it captures the spirit of the comicbooks. only depardieu and clavier don\\'t really overact, which might be the reason some people think they didn\\'t enjoy their roles (i didn\\'t notice a thing). on the other hand jamel debouze and especially claude rich turn overacting into an artform. it\\'s actually fun to watch. again, i fear it wouldn\\'t be nearly as funny when the voices are dubbed. overall not a bad movie at all, much better than the previous one. it\\'s not a classic and it doesn\\'t dethrone the twelve tasks of asterix as my favourite asterix movie, but it\\'s still worth seeing. the french version, that is. 7/10 i would label this show as horrendous if it weren\\'t for the fact that it\\'s on the same network as arrested development. because it is on fox and getting renewed while ad got cancelled. it is absolutely beyond words how atrocious this show actually is. but let me try and describe it. take an extremely low rate archie bunker and have him spout out humor that would have been out of date if it were on married with children. then take great plot lines from ad (son has an ugly, boring girlfriend) and dumb them down so the idiots who watch sitcoms can understand them. if you watch this, i will have completely lost respect for you, as should your family. however, if you are a fan, you should love fox\\'s new comedy \\'til death. looks like real funny, cutting-edge stuff. i mean, married couples not getting along ... brilliant. robert mitchum stars as clint tollinger in this short but tough western: man with the gun. tollinger is a professional town tamer - as in, when a town needs someone to save itself; he is the one who is brought in to do it. tollinger\\'s latest gig comes by as an accident: strolling into town looking for his former fling, he stumbles into a town being played like a puppet by a local western gangster. but many townspeople begin to rue the day they hired tollinger, as his way of cleaning up the town becomes very taxing (suddenly high plains drifter seems less original). man with the gun starts off as an average western tough-guy film but begins to surprise you more and more as the film progresses. what starts off as forgettable and run-of-the-mill ends up dark and character-centered. the entire film is very well shot and the cast is very enjoyable. mitchum is his usual excellent self here in man with the gun - not one of his very best performances, mitchum still has his classic and effective tough-guy screen presence in high gear and he knocks the action-packed, meaningful, and shocking scenes of the film right out of the park. man with the gun is a nice mitchum western and is easily worth one\\'s time. my favorite film this year. great characters and plot, and the direction and editing was smooth, visually beautiful, and interesting. set in barcelona, the film follows a year in the lives of six foreign graduate students and assorted others. cultures and languages clash but hearts and lives intertwine. the leading role would never have been cast in hollywood, but he carried the part perfectly. the characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and accurate. there were two especially noteworthy scenes, the climax was truly inspired. the film is sentimental, and the last ten minutes could have been cut, but it was wonderfully entertaining. i nearly didn\\'t watch it, but did just to see audrey tautou. her role although billed second or third was minor, and was outshined by several other characters. i wish more films like this were made. it brought to mind the big chill or the breakfast club. don\\'t start this movie late if you plan to go to bed 1/2 way through. the film itself is absolutely brilliant, its that buzz, that rush that makes you just want to go out, blow your wages and loose yourself. it\\'s what the weekend is all about, its our sanitation where we can come together as one and be ourselves without a care in the world. the film is layered in depth and the dialogue in places is just spot on, especially with jip. the characters themselves are instantly likable, one in particular is obviously dyers character and his views on what \"star wars\" is really about, genius. if ever you\\'ve got an hour to kill before going out, stick on this, you\\'ll immediately feel yourself growing in confidence, definitely recommend it. i didn\\'t expect much when i first saw the dvd cover. i mean, pierce brosnan as grey owl?? ah...but then the story got underway, unfolded in a beautifully photographed and paced film. i was surprised and delighted at this (basically) true story. made me want to read more about this fascinating character, which means, the director fulfilled his purpose, and the film was a success! this is more than a sat. afternoon special. exremely well written if very low key there is a lot here if you look for it. catch the cat companion/scout for instance. it not only could have been a comic book it should have been a comic book. the comic industry (as well as the film\\'s publicists) missed the boat on this. one of the least know really great films. a great script by john sayles is a strong point but the acting is good as well. probably the best \"super hero\" film i\\'ve ever seen. short on special effects but long on believability. this one\\'s a keeper. i have never seen a dvd of this film but i used to own a vhs version. good hunting i have to say this is the worst movie that i have ever watched in my life, i cannot believe that i wasted $10 at blockbuster ; this movie should be burned and who ever thought of it has issues. who ever actually spent money to make this movie was insane =d this movie has terrible actors and some of the scenes make absolutely no sense. well, the whole movie doesn\\'t make sense. also the part where those \"men\" come into the diner ( department of national securities )that happened to be the worst part of the film. how dare they say frank sinatra\\'s name in vain? also, what is up with those glasses? when the guy and girl are in the car and she \"drinks\" water, you can totally tell that she isn\\'t even drinking! also, what is up with the freaky dinner guy. and everyone knows that you don\\'t stab tires, you slash them. this is the best of shelley duvall\\'s high-quality \"faerie tale theatre\" series. the ugly stepsisters are broadway-quality comedy relief, and eve arden is the personification of wicked stepmotherhood. jennifer beals does an excellent job as a straight cinderella, especially in the garden scene with matthew broderick\\'s prince charming. jean stapleton plays the fairy godmother well, although i\\'m not sure i liked the \"southern lady\" characterization with some of the lines. steve martin\\'s comedy relief as the royal orchestra conductor is quintessential martin, but a tiny bit misplaced in the show\\'s flow. as is customary with the series, there are several wry comments thrown in for the older children (ages 15 and up). with a couple of small bumps, the show flows well, and they live happily ever after. children up to age 8 will continue to watch it after the parents finally get tired of it -- i found 3 times in one day to be a little too much. i am definitely a burt reynolds fan, but sorry, this one really stinks. most of the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist is in the last five minutes of the movie. i can\\'t believe he even made this one. is he actually that hard up for money? let me say from the outset i\\'m not a particular fan of this kind of film, but nightbreed holds a certain fascination for me with a message about perspective. back in the old days, the folks who inhabit midian would have been called zombies, the undead. and according to what clive barker has given us certain members of human kind, in this craig sheffer are born with the potential to become part of that world. psychiatrist david cronenberg at first looking like the mild mannered professional has taken unto himself a fanatical mission to rid the world of the nightbreed. he tricks the police into killing sheffer, but sheffer goes to a graveyard named midian cemetery where the nightbreed congregate and live underground. sheffer has also left a girl friend, anne bobby, who still has feelings for him even after he\\'s been killed and is now one of the undead. she tries in her own small way to be a bridge to humankind. clive barker\\'s creatures are a pretty gruesome looking lot and are not particularly fond of humans. but it\\'s plain to see that if humans left them alone, the nightbreed in turn not bother with them. your sympathies are definitely with the nightbreed especially after seeing a fanatic like cronenberg and redneck police chief charles haid in action. clive barker\\'s been an out gay man for some time now and some have suggested to me that the nightbreed is a metaphor for gay people. i can see where that would come in, especially since there are a whole lot of people who don\\'t even think of gays as anything human because they\\'re taught that way. granted nightbreed is pretty bloody with a lot of gratuitous violence, but it also does make you think and i do like the way clive barker does turn traditional theology on its head and makes craig sheffer a kind of messiah for the nightbreed creatures. i have never read the bradbury novel that this movie is based on but from what i\\'ve gathered, it will be interesting (when i finally do read it and i will). my comments will be based purely on the film. as soon as i saw the trailer i knew i had to see it and was so excited but when i finally did, i was so disappointed it hurt. this is because the movie itself felt so amateurish. the actors were not well cast (though robards and pryce are both good actors - just not here). the kid actors, it seemed, were merely asked to show up, get in the characters\\' clothes, say the lines and make the faces. the set and props were cheap and unrealistic. the direction was surprisingly bad. i was so surprised at the awfulness of it that i had to go online and check who directed it, just to see the kind of work he had done. the editing was cut and paste and the plot (screenplay) was just that as well (even though the author had been involved himself, irony?). the building up of the tension, fear and suspense was so mild it was ineffective when the climax finally came. i\\'ve read some of the comments on this movie and find it hard to believe people actually like it. what hurts the most is that the content is interesting and fun and intriguing. it had so much potential. unfortunately, the film was so technically bad it takes away from the brilliance of the story. this is a truly awful \"b\" movie. it is witless and often embarrassing. the plot, the basic \"making into show business\" routine, is almost nonexistent. in fact, the film is merely an excuse to push the war effort and highlight some popular music groups of 1942, including the mills brothers, count basie, duke ellington, bob crosby, and freddy slack. each group gets about the standard three minutes, the exception being the mills brothers, who for some reason warranted two numbers. ann miller doesn\\'t get to dance until the last couple of minutes of the film, and she has little to do but strut her stuff amid a barrage of patriotic propaganda. the most interesting moment in the film, in my view, occurred in the duke ellington segment. the band appears to be playing in a train, standing in awkward positions. (in the deep south at the time, the band was segregated in railroad cars when traveling.) johnny hodges is seen next to duke, and harry carney may also be identified. in the last moments of the film, trumpeter/violinist ray nance rushes down the aisle to the camera and does an \"uncle tom,\" bugging his eyes and wiggling his head the way willy best did in many films. for modern viewers, especially jazz fans, this homage to segregation is sad indeed. some movies go best unseen. i have to admit i am prejudiced about my vote on this film, but i have strong reasons as i know some of the true history that was given the hollywood treatment here. edna ferber\\'s novel upon which this is based is from an era where real names can\\'t be used. in a way, this film is all smoke & mirrors. even though it was released in 1946, it was filmed shortly after casablanca. ingrid bergman is at her most radiant in this movie as a brunette. she plays a beautiful woman who is trying to trade on her beauty to get a rich husband. today that is a gold digger, but in this social era, she is desirable & the kind of woman who makes all the men want her, & all the old snooty society types talk of her & avoid her, while wishing they were her. ingrid is at her best & plays this role well. some sympathy for ingrids character is raised in the new orleans section of this film as she manages to get a decent belated tomb for her scandalized mother as part of the settlement by her relatives to get her to leave new orleans. the snooty family of relatives there are so scandalized by her that they will do almost anything she asks to get her to leave town. gary cooper is good in this film though he already appears to be aging a bit to play a dashing texan bachelor/gambler. he pulls it off well considering that handicap which he appeared older than he was due to his real life chain smoking. flora robison as ingrid\\'s maid got nominated for an oscar as supporting actress in this film. jerry austin as cupidor was over-looked in many ways for his role but is the only comic relief in the film & does it well. when the film moves to saratoga, it depicts accurately how important saratoga was in that era. i like the sequence when bergman walks to the saratoge spring to get some of the \"sulfur\" water which everyone considered so healthy then. when she drinks some she forces herself not to make a face and comments how good it is & that she must have more. the real history is the railroad battle which really occurred on the rail line in tunnel, new york- which is the actual saratoga trunk the film title is derived from. this battle actually happened in 1869 between agents for andrew carnagie & j. p. morgan. the line was the economic key to the country in 1869 connecting coal country & the east coast. the references to it are throughout the film are very real. there is even some dialog describing carnagie as a \"scot\" though the reference is vague & unfamiliar to anyone not knowing the history around the battle. the railroad line & the railroad tunnel in tunnel, new york (zip code 13848) still exist although the film was shot in california. the real tunnel is about 1 mile long. it is still part of a key freight line today, years after this occurred. i grew up there. gary cooper\\'s line in the film while he is riding the train into the tunnel is right, it is still \"mighty pretty country\". this movie isn\\'t even good enough for the $1 bin at the grocery store. i only purchased it because terrence howard was in it. guess he couldn\\'t be too choosy about his roles during this time. the movie in itself was hard to sit through. it seemed they were grasping at straws with a storyline. the \"guys night out\" had to be the most boring i\\'ve ever seen. one minute they are talking and the next reciting poetry? even the arguments were hard to follow. most of the acting lacked any depth. i have no idea what they were going for with this one but they certainly missed the mark. this is a spectacular production! i have seen the show live twice in chicago and my only problem with the production was the fact that i was able to perceive only fragments of what was going on. the stage consisted of three giant catwalks and the platform and as the action moves from one part of the stage to the next sometime you loose track of what is going on no matter where you are located. as always, this is a thought-provoking sensory overload, skillfully captured in high definition with 15 cameras! the footage was masterfully edited, one of the best concert dvds of all times in my opinion! i only hope and wish that they will release this on blu-ray of hd-dvd so that we can re-live this extravaganza over and over again. i\\'m not going to bag this film for all the myriad technical f|u|c|k|u|p|s, it would take two days to outline how the whole thing isn\\'t even remotely possible. others have pointed out all the relevant stupidities already. given all that, i still could have sort of enjoyed it, if only they hadn\\'t included all the maudlin, nauseating, infuriating, disneyesque sentimental crap, which is so out of place anywhere, but nowhere more than out in space, where the tiniest mistake can mean instant death. the \"crew\", as well as the \"real\" astronaut were equally guilty of putting all their fatuous nonsense ahead of everything else. it completely ruined any value the production may have had left. i\\'m surprised nasa let this garbage out so that so many people would get so much misinformation about something so important to them. if you haven\\'t seen this yet, save yourself the irritation. watch apollo 13 again. at least that tried to be sort of real. this film was adapted from the well known sutra on journey to the west where a monk with his three students seek out to find a long lost book with regards to the teaching of buddha. though this movie is not as solemn as the previous films made according to the legend, it did however, managed to bring in romance and fun-filled humorous scene. this real objective of this movie revolves around more on the monk who were primarily saved from being eaten by demonic flying creatures. one of his student, the monkey god managed to get him out from the battle in the nick of time, but were in turn captured by the demons and cast into the deep throat of a dragon, locked up in that particular dungeon. the monk awoke in a small village where he found mei yan (the so called ugly serpent daughter) who fell in love over him at first sight. though ugly, she did not let her appearance be casted aside from getting to him. however, a quest for rescuing his three students soon turn out to be filled with obstacles and each of which turned out to get worse with mei yan following the monk. problems crept deeper and this is where conflicts between the relationship gets worse. the rest of the tale would be left at your own disposal, but suffice to say, this film does not depict the typical storyline of the book, it is more for those who wants to seek out for a funny and light picture of what journey to the west and the love obstacles really mean. towards the very end, the whole summary could be described with only one word, and that is love. the monk went to show the heavenly gates, the celestial palace and buddha himself how love can overcome even the worst fear of all and deemed fit as the most powerful weapon that can be used against any enemy of superior powers. a wonderfully created and funny acts awaits those who buys this ticket. there would be of course, no regrets, at least from my side and those who were with me at the cinema that day watching the same film. let me first state that i enjoy watching \"bad\" movies. it\\'s funny how some of these films leave more of a lasting impression than the truly superb ones. this film is bad in a disturbingly malicious way. this vehicle for sam mraovich\\'s delusional ego doesn\\'t just border on talentless ineptitude, it has redefined the very meaning of the words. this should forever be the barometer for bad movies. sort of the mendoza line for film. mr. mraovich writes, directs, and stars as blunt object arthur sailes battling scorned wives and the christian forces of evil as he and his partner ben \"dead behind the eyes\" sheets struggle for marital equality. as a libertarian i believe gays should have a right to get married. ben & arthur do more harm to that cause than an army of homophobes. the portrayal of all things christian are so ugly and ham-fisted, trademark mraovich, that you can\\'t possibly take any of them seriously. arthur\\'s brother victor, the bible toting jesus freak, is so horribly over-the-top evil/effeminately gay that you have to wonder how he was cast in this role. that\\'s because sam \"multitasking\" mraovich was also casting director. the worst of it all is sam mraovich himself. when you think leading man do the words pasty, balding, and chubby come to mind? sam also delivers lines like domino\\'s pizza, cold and usually wrong. the final tally: you suck at writing, directing, acting and casting. that\\'s the ed wood quadruple crown. congratulations you horrible little man. essentially a undistinguished b-movie that mysteriously is directed by one of the golden era\\'s major talents, fritz lang. even with the stellar names of lang, walter pidgeon, joan bennett and george sanders, be prepared for a ludicrous storyline, bad acting, patently phony sets and miscasting. for transparency sake, i have to admit i am an ardent non-admirer of walter pidgeon, who was lucky to have found a niche at the artificial dream-factory of mgm, and somehow worked in secondary roles, supporting greer garson and others. he is wildly miscast, acting in a chipper, \\'30s-ray milland madcap comedy tone, in a role where his life is in danger, and he is in hiding. joan bennett\\'s cockney accent is excessive, but her lacquered hair, perfect makeup and classy outfit belies a street-wise cockney slum-girl. george sanders is incapable of bad acting, but disappears after the preposterous opening finds pidgeon somehow pretending to shoot adolph hitler. surprising for fritz lang is the unevenness of tone. i found the film wavered uneasily between occasional moments of suspense-thriller surrounded by light-hearted comedic interplay. hitchcock totally reversed the ratio, using comic relief to occasionally pace the suspense. there is a reason this film is unknown. it didn\\'t serve or propel anybody\\'s career or reputation, and is forgotten because it\\'s a surprisingly bad film from such a pedigreed group. when, oh when, will hollyweird write a decent movie based around computers? i cannot believe people actually consider this movie to be a credible story. no computer operating system could ever survive wit that sort of annoying scrolling interface. it may look good on a movie screen but if you actually tried using it for any length of time you would go nuts. as for \"tracing\" people the way she did it simply cannot be done that way. network security alone would prevent that from happening. the key stroke logging was laughable to say the least. regarding the software that was supposedly being installed, no system administrator would allow such a critical piece of software to be installed on a production system until it has been tested, retested and tested again on a sandbagged system. but probably the worst possible part of the movie was the \"virus\". there is no way that a virus that works on one operating system will work on any other system. and as for a virus that could take out a mainframe is a couple of seconds, that just beggars belief. there is no way that an open remote connection would have the required superuser access that would allow deletion of system files. i could go on but i can\\'t be bothered. a porno has a better thought out plot that this pile of garbage. this movie was so incredibly boring, michael j. fox could\\'ve done so much better. sorry, but it\\'s true for all you people who liked the movie this movie is so unreal. french movies like these are just waste of time. why watch this movie? even, i did not know..why. what? the well known sex scene of half-siblings? although the sex scene is so real and explicit, but the story it is based upon is so unreal. what is the use of it, then? can you find easily in life, half sibling doing such things? did i learn something from this movie? yeah: some people are just so fond of wasting time making such movies, such stories, such non-sense. but for those who like nihilism, nothingness in life, or simply a life without hope, then there you are.. you\\'ve got to see this movie. only one worth adoring, though: catherine deneuve. she\\'s such a strikingly beautiful woman. the nest is really just another \\'nature run amock\\' horror flick that fails because of the low budget. the acting is ok, and the setting is great, but somehow the whole film just seemed a bit dull to me. the gore effects are not the best i\\'ve seen but are fun in a cheesy sort of way. the roaches themselves are just regular cockroaches that bite people. the nest reminded me of a much better film called slugs. if you liked the nest then slugs is a must-see as it\\'s ten times better. also worth noting is that lisa langlois who plays elizabeth was in another \\'nature run amock\\' type film called deadly eyes (aka the rats), which is about killer rats as you may have guessed. if you enjoy these types of horror films then you may want to give this a watch, but you\\'d be far better off seeing slugs which is far more interesting and gory. excellent endearing film with peter falk and paul reiser joining forces as father and dad. dad shows up one evening to state that after over 40 years of marriage, mom (olympia dukakis) has left him. the rest of the film depicts the father and son on a day trip to get dad\\'s thoughts off what has occurred. with them away, the daughters can play detectives. the story shows the adventures of father and son in their discussion of life, what should have been, why mom was complaining about dad as they discuss their philosophies of life. we see an unexpected fishing trip and pool playing which leads to a near brawl. both men seem to break out of their daily lives. the end is a downer as we learn why mom suddenly left. it becomes a story of courage and the human spirit in the face of adversity. it\\'s never too late to change. beware, my lovely is an experimental studio film from the early fifties and was directed by a man, harry horner, better known for his set designs. robert ryan plays a handyman who is hired by ida lupino to do some housework for her. the problem is that he is a psychopathic murderer and doesn\\'t know it. miss lupino is an empathetic soul and tries to win ryan over, to little avail. he is not the sort of man compassion could help or cure. thus we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean well, but one of them can\\'t do well because there is something wrong with him. he suffers periodic blackouts during which he commits acts of violence, which he later forgets. essentially the effect ryan has on lupino is that of the hunter and his prey, or in another sense a sadist. the audience finds out early on that ryan is a mad killer, but it takes lupino much longer. thus we must live with this knowledge as we watch poor miss lupino try everything in her power to \\'win\\' ryan over in order to make things work, get the job done, get on with life. but getting on with things isn\\'t in ryan\\'s makeup, as he is incapable of any but the most rudimentary forms of normality, and as soon as there is an opening his paranoia asserts itself. as a study in mental illness the movie isn\\'t too impressive. what it\\'s superlative at is showing the effect of major mental illness, with dangerous psychopathology in the mix, and its effect on a normal person. in this regard the film is realistic and compassionate, though relentlessly logical in that we know lupino can\\'t \\'fix\\' ryan, yet we want her to. the result is that, if one is willing, one can get extremely involved in this film emotionally if one can put aside, so to speak, its melodramatic structure. horner shows us, gradually, the layout the lupino house , a forbidding gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home. we become familiar with staircase, kitchen and pantry; and we come to know which windows miss lupino can use for an escape and which ones she can\\'t. marie dressler carries this depression-era drama about a kindly bank owner, which recently aired on tcm during their april fools comedy month. if you come with the expectation of big laughs courtesy the dressler-polly moran team, you\\'ll be disappointed, as this is really a very downbeat film. it\\'s also very poorly made, surprisingly so considering it came from mgm. leonard smith\\'s bare bones cinematography is strictly from the \\'set up the camera and don\\'t move it\\' school, frequently to the detriment of the cast, who find themselves delivering lines off screen (it\\'s like a pan and scan print before such existed!) or having their heads cut off. the film doesn\\'t even have a credited director, underlying the apparent fly by night nature of the production. overall, it\\'s an unsatisfying mess, with dressler frequently over-emoting and only that bizarre, final reel dash to the bathroom to set it apart. cyclone is a piece of dreck with little redeeming value, even on the so bad its entertaining front. a friend of mine took the tape from an overflowing st. vincent depaul clothes bin. okay, that may be a little bit dodgy but it was meant to be a clothes bin, not a crappy old vhs bin, something the less fortunate members of our society don\\'t really need to make their lives better. it could be considered a mercy. watching a movie like cyclone would really only add to their problems. anyway the basic premise of a woman with a super-powerful motorcycle that it armed to the teeth with rockets and lasers isn\\'t even properly exploited. the two \\'high speed\\' chase sequences involve vehicles travelling at less than hair raising speeds of around 40 kmph and a super-fast motorcycle that is in danger of being overtaken by a crappy old station wagon is not that awe inspiring when you get down to it. there is only one scene where the bikes goofy weaponry is used, at the film\\'s climax, and it is laughably ineffectual, or just laughable, when it is. this includes laser beams that look like they should be coming out of the hands of an evil wizard in a cheesy eighties sword and sorcery that produced large bursts of flame which seem to have no noticeable effect on their targets even when they hit directly. the rest of the movie is just tedious hard to watch filler. lots of bad actors, yes even combs and landau suck in this, most of whom seem like they have been lifted from the set of a porno movie stand around exchanging really bad dialogue in a desperate attempt to pus forward the barely coherent plot. there are a few badly staged fight sequences and some excruciatingly unfunny comic relief scenes with some cops and the owner of the motor cycle repair shop. comedy of the sub benny hill horny old man can\\'t stop staring at the female leads chest variety. basically the \\'money\\' scenes involving the bike actually doing stuff are few and lame and the rest is clunky filler material. skip it. \"cinderella\" is one of the most beloved of all disney classics. and it really deserves its status. based on the classic fairy-tale as told by charles perrault, the film follows the trials and tribulations of cinderella, a good girl who is mistreated by her evil stepmother and equally unlikable stepsisters. when a royal ball is held and all eligible young women are invited (read: the king wants to get the prince to marry), cinderella is left at home whilst her stepmother takes her awful daughters with her. but there is a fairy godmother on hand... the story of \"cinderella\" on its own wouldn\\'t be able to pad out a feature, so whilst generally staying true to the story otherwise, the fairly incidental characters of the animals whom the fairy godmother uses to help get the title character to the ball become cinderella\\'s true sidekicks. the mice jaq and gus are the main sidekicks, and their own nemesis being the stepmother\\'s cat lucifer. their antics intertwine generally with the main fairy-tale plot, and are for the most part wonderful. admittedly, the film does slow down a bit between the main introduction of the characters and shortly before the stepsisters depart for the ball, but after this slowdown, the film really gets going again and surprisingly (since \"cinderella\" is the most worn down story of all time, probably) ends up as one of the most involving disney stories. the animation and art direction is lovely. all of the legendary nine old men animated on this picture, and mary blair\\'s colour styling and concept art (she also did concept art and colour styling for \"alice in wonderland\", \"peter pan\", \"the three caballeros\" and many many others) manage to wiggle their way on screen. the colours and designs are lovely, especially in the fairy godmother and ball scenes, as well as in those pretty little moments here and there. overall, \"cinderella\" ranks as one of the best disney fairy-tales and comes recommended to young and all that embodies the disney philosophy that dreams really can come true. **might contain spoilers** ok, lets conclude this movie in one word: bad. two words? really bad. now why do i think that? let me explain. guttenberg leads a special-ops team consisting of four persons that get assigned to retake an lethal virus after some arms-dealer stole it from a lab. they do this by attacking the arm-dealers in mid-flight and somehow gets back the virus after some fighting. however, suspicions arise about guttenberg because one of the terrorist knew his name. after debriefing the team-members get attacked by unknown persons and everyone starts to suspect everyone else is involved. after deciding they cant trust their bosses, they decide to, once again, steal the virus and try to lure out the possible attackers. in theory this is a plot that could have worked in a low-budget movie that just aims to be aired on tv. however, the plot is compromised and the movie ruined in several accounts. firstly, the plot is totally predictable and it is not fun to know how the movie is going to end after three minutes. second. the acting is really bad, or the actors are directed to act as dummys. there aren\\'t many emotions, change of facial expressions at all etc. i was especially disappointed in guttenberg that i believe can do so much more, but fails completely in an attempt to be a rough action-hero. in addition, though i am not by any means any expert on the subject, i totally believe i could assemble a better covert-ops team by picking up five strangers and train them for a week. this seems to be a theme in the movie to do things as stupid and unprofessionally as possible. this go for good guys, bad guys and bystanders as well. then i sincerely doubt the scientific and technical consultants, if any, of the film. for example, i have poured liquid nitrogen over my hand and i didn\\'t break instantly. don\\'t know how to conclude this really, but lets say that this movie has a predictable plot, bad acting and they seem to be amateurs in whatever the do. sorry, can\\'t be any nicer than that. do not watch this movie, it is not even so bad it is funny. 2/10 the premise of an african-american female scrooge in the modern, struggling city was inspired, but nothing else in this film is. here, ms. scrooge is a miserly banker who takes advantage of the employees and customers in the largely poor and black neighborhood it inhabits. there is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved. part of the problem is that story\\'s roots don\\'t translate well into the urban setting of this film, and the script fails to make the update work. also, the constant message about sharing and giving is repeated so endlessly, the audience becomes tired of it well before the movie reaches its familiar end. this is a message film that doesn\\'t know when to quit. in the title role, the talented cicely tyson gives an overly uptight performance, and at times lines are difficult to understand. the charles dickens novel has been adapted so many times, it\\'s a struggle to adapt it in a way that makes it fresh and relevant, in spite of its very relevant message. it was evident until the final credits that this film was made in 1989, as all the elements of its production were made to look 1960\\'s - the acting, the characterisations, the sets and the props all had an aesthetic from an earlier time. the film opens to the moments prior to the dropping of the a-bomb on hiroshima and how this tragic incident affects one family: a young woman, yasuko, who lives with her aunt and uncle. even in black and white, and using special effects that are quite primitive by modern standards but emotive and effective nonetheless, the depictions of the immediate aftermath of the bomb are quite horrific. family members become unrecognisable to each other, others resemble zombies as they wander the streets bedraggled and in shock. the title refers to rainfall that fell soon after the bomb, which was mixed with radioactive ash, and in which yasuko is caught. rumors of yasuko\\'s being in hiroshima at the time of the bombing affect her marriage prospects and it is later learnt that the black rain is indeed causing sicknesses. the film is concerned not just with the physical effects of the bomb on the japanese, but on the social and psychological damage that was wrought. i found the film compassionate and a fascinating journey into a unique culture. while the film is primarily concerned with the pain felt by one family, the film\\'s gentle political message is relevant today and probably for all time - wars have horrific consequences, and should not be entered into unless absolutely necessary. it is said that history repeats itself, and the current leaders of the \\'coalition of the willing\\' have learned nothing. while atomic warfare has not resurfaced since 1945, other deadly after-effects have. this film is compelling viewing. i have very few to add to what all the other reviewers already made more than clear! this movie is awful! beyond awful... in fact, so insufferable that they have yet to come up with a term to describe the awfulness that is \"skeleton man\". in case you expect your movies to feature a minimum of logic and plot, you should stay as far away from this as humanly possible. sure, loads of people are getting killed by this skeleton-puppet wearing a ridiculous cape, but nobody ever bothers to properly explain what he is, where he comes from or why he\\'s so angry with the world. he looks like a crossover between skeletor from \"masters of the universe\" and the horseman from \"sleepy hollow\" and runs amok in some godforsaken wilderness. the setting of \"skeleton man\" is another totally retarded aspect! for nearly half an hour, i assumed that the movie took place at a small isolated island, but it simply plays at the mainland where fancy highways cross the forest and power plants are located at the end of the woods! huh? why does everybody pretend to be trapped when there are like a million escape routes? anyway, after a couple of totally random killings, a special commando squad, led by poor washed-up michael rooker, arrives to come and hunt a monster they don\\'t know anything about. really hilarious is how every member of this squad introduces him/herself as the expert in a certain field (we have a sniper-specialist, a tracking genius, a drill instructor...), yet they all die before any of them is able to demonstrate their supposedly masterful skills! the horror gods must really hate casper van dien, as he\\'s present again as well, portraying an heroic soldier who steals a truck for no apparent reason, crashes on the highway, but somehow gets catapulted back to the middle of the woods to die there. right, that makes sense... furthermore the characters steal cool one-liners from \"predator\", the bonehead\\'s horse constantly changes colors, helicopters are brought down with bow& arrows, ordinary bullets cause trees to explode and completely pointless vietnam flashbacks haunt michael rooker. i say we all combine forces and vote this pathetic flick into the imdb bottom top 100 asap! this is a very funny movie, easy to watch, that entertains you almost all the time. the work of the director is recognizable and the type of humor is his trademark. the movie is a typical police partners history like lethal weapon, but the jokes and comedy are of argentinian sort. the twist is that one of them is a psychologist played by peretti and has to go with detective diaz (played by luque) on his assignments while he also assist him (diaz is troubled because his wife cheated on him). some of the dialogs are hilarious worldwide: understandable and laughable anywhere. is very good overall, it would deserved an 8, but i rated 7 because it gets a little down at the end. on a personal remark i must add that is a \"bravo\" for argentinian filmmakers, considering the little good is coming lately. i\\'ll give writer/director william gove credit for finding someone to finance this ill-conceived \"thriller.\" a good argument for not wasting money subscribing to hbo, let alone buying dvds based on cover art and blurbs. a pedestrian dennis hopper and a game richard grieco add nothing significant to their resumes, although the art direction is not half bad. the dialogue will leave you grimacing with wonder at its conceit; this is storytelling at its worst. no tension, no suspense, no dread, no fear, no empathy, no catharsis, no nothing. a few attractive and often nude females spice up the boredom, but this is definitely a film best seen as a trailer. i feel sorry for the guy who greenlighted this thing. good for late-night, zoned-out viewing only. you have been warned. i\\'ll give this movie two stars because it teems with beautiful photography. otherwise, it teems mainly with clichã©s and stereotypes: mountain people are either dumb white trash of the fanatically religious or ragged racist kind, or wise white indians. indians are magical people who move around without a sound, can disappear in the blink of an eye, talk to animals, and read minds over large distances. and so on and so forth. throughout the movie i kept wondering what the point of the film was (other than showing me pretty pictures of mountains, log cabins, woods, an assortment of animals, free-spirited mountain-dwellers and freaky people in church). the plot touched a whole range of issues but explored none of them in depth. this was neither a story about growing up during the depression, nor about about being an orphan, nor about a struggle for identity. it tried to be all of those things and more, which made it superficial and unsatisfactory. although the movie was supposed to be about little tree\\'s education, we learn almost nothing about it. he was given a brief summary of the history of his people (who were brave and stoic) and a distillery demonstration; tried his hand at chopping wood (at which he failed) and whiskey running (literally); learned how to read (and maybe to write) with the help of grandma and her dictionary - and that was it. apparently he didn\\'t learn much during his stint in boarding school because he was locked up in the attic. however, grandma and grandpa and graham greene\\'s character made sure that in the end little tree became a very spiritual person whose main goal as an adult - after, and i\\'m paraphrasing here, \"riding with the navajos\" and \"getting caught up in a couple of wars\" - was to \"catch up\" with grandma and grandpa and graham greene\\'s character in heaven (instead of, say, dating girls, getting married, having children or other such nonsense). last but not least i must say that i found grandpa\\'s trade offensive. why of all things did it have to be a whiskey still? to counteract the stereotype of the \"drunken indian\"? \"laugh, clown laugh\" released in 1928, stars the legendary lon chaney as a circus clown named tito. tito has raised a foundling (a young and beautiful loretta young) to adulthood and names her simonetta. tito has raised the girl in the circus life, and she has become an accomplished ballerina. while chaney gives his usual great performance, i could not get past the fact that tito, now well into middle age, has the hots for the young simonetta. although he is not her biological father, he has raised her like a daughter. that kind of \"ick\" factor permeates throughout the film. tito competes for simonetta\\'s affections with a young and handsome \\'count\\' luigi (nils asther). simonetta clearly falls for the young man, but feels guilt about abandoning tito (out of loyalty, not romantic love). the whole premise of the film is ridiculous, and i find it amazing that no one in the film tells tito what a stupid old fool he is being (until he reveals it himself at the end). the film is noteworthy only because of loretta young, who would go on to have a great career. while i adore chaney\\'s brilliance as an actor, this whole film seems off to me and just downright creepy. i\\'m sorry guys, all who thought this film could be something great, i\\'m afraid you would be disappointed. the standard, the movie wanted to set is completely ruined by some very simple plot. so simple, that the movie is not evolving until the end. i asked myself if the plot wasn\\'t about the action but about the main character (played by mickey rourke), but i found that the character was inconsistent - either he is a professional killer or some guilt haunted brother. but both don\\'t go together, because the kid he tries to guide poses him in dangerous situations where no professional killer would put himself. now, joseph gordon-levitt, is a good looking actor, but he played his character a little unnatural. i didn\\'t believe his acting, it looked like the director tried to pull out of him some personality he couldn\\'t provide. and he didn\\'t have to, because his less crazy behavior was creepy enough. the only one whose acting was great, was diane lane. if not her, i would give this movie 1 star. in conclusion, i expected to see some well played movie and some interesting plot. and i completely blew it with my high expectations. musically speaking irving berlin gave fred astaire and ginger rogers another pluperfect musical after top hat if that was possible. although in this case like that jerome kern confection roberta that they were in, follow the fleet retained randolph scott with another singer, this time harriet hilliard. randolph scott is a career navy cpo and fred astaire is an ex-vaudevillian who enlisted in the navy to forget ginger rogers his former partner. but now the two are on shore leave. fred and ginger take up right where they left off, and randy accidentally meets ginger\\'s dowdy sister harriet who blossoms into a real beauty. but randy\\'s a typical love \\'em and leave \\'em sailor. again irving berlin wrote a hit filled score with him tightly supervising the production. ginger gets to do some really outstanding vocalizing with let yourself go which she and fred later dance to. but the real hit of the show is let\\'s face the music and dance which is a number done at a navy show. sung first by astaire and later danced to by the pair, let\\'s face the music and dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen. their dancing on this one is absolute magic. i\\'m sure that when i mention harriet hilliard a few younger people might ask who that was. but they will know immediately when i mention her in conjunction with her famous husband ozzie nelson. that\\'s right ozzie and harriet. it\\'s something of a mystery to me why harriet stopped singing when she just became david and ricky\\'s mom on television. then again she didn\\'t even keep her own name. neither ozzie or harriet sang on television. ozzie was a pale imitation of rudy vallee as a singer, but harriet could really carry a tune. she sings get thee behind me satan and the moon and i are here, but where are you, both with real feeling and class. i recommend you see follow the fleet if for no other reason than to hear a dimension of harriet hilliard incredibly forgotten today. i can never fathom why people take time to review movies that they have not understood fully. i know people will read scathing reviews on these pages of this film, and it will keep them from seeking copies of this quite forgotten, late \\'20s style but 1932 movie, which should probably be referred to as \"indecent,\" as that is the name on the main titles. myrna loy, best known as a comic actress in countless genteel roles, shows herself to be miscast in all of them. she was a true dramatic actress, something that i did not know before watching this film, which predates all of her famous roles. she is exciting and moving here, two things she never was opposite the graceful and refined william powell. i\\'m still rather in shock over how good she was. becky sharp (1935), the first three-strip technicolor feature, is more familiar but this one is far better artistically and an adaptation. it is also very poignant as an expression of a film style that was about to die. you cannot take my word for it, you must see it. i\\'m always surprised about how many times you\\'ll see something about world war 2 on the german national television. you would think they don\\'t like to open old wounds, but there isn\\'t a week that goes by without a documentary or a movie about the horror and atrocities of this war. perhaps it\\'s a way of dealing with their past, i don\\'t know, but you sure can\\'t blame them of ignoring what happened. and it has to be said: most of those documentaries are really worth a watch because they never try to gloss over the truth and the same can be said about their movies (think for instance about \"der untergang\" or \"the downfall\" as you might now it) which are also very realistic. one of those movies is \"rosenstrasse\". it tells a true story and deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the war, even though the movie starts with a family in the usa, at the present day. after hannah\\'s father died, her mother all a sudden turned into an orthodox jew even though she hasn\\'t been very religious before. she doesn\\'t know where the strange behavior of her mother comes from, but as she starts digging in her mother\\'s troubled childhood, hannah understands how little she has ever known about her mother\\'s past. the fact that this movie deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the nazi regime is already quite surprising. for as far as i know, there hasn\\'t been another movie that deals with this subject. (for those who didn\\'t know this yet: being married to a so-called pure aryian man or woman meant for many jews that they weren\\'t immediately sent to one of the concentration camps, but that they had to work in a factory). but it does not only tell something about the problems of the mixed marriages, it also gives a good idea of how these people were often seen by their own parents and relatives. how difficult it sometimes was for them during the nazi regime and how these people, most of the time women, did everything within their power to free their men, once they were captured and locked away in for instance the rosenstrasse... the acting is really good and the story is very well written, although the way it was presented in the beginning didn\\'t really do it for me (and that\\'s exactly the only part that you\\'ll get to see in the trailer). perhaps it\\'s just me, but i would have left out a big part of what happens in the present day. at least of the part that is situated in the usa, because the part where hannah goes to berlin and talks to someone who knows more about her mother\\'s past, definitely works. if you are interested in everything that has something to do with the second world war, and if you aren\\'t necessarily looking for a lot of action shots, than this is definitely a movie you should see. this isn\\'t a movie in which you\\'ll see any battles or gunfights, but it certainly is an interesting movie, because it gives you an idea about an aspect of the war only little is known of. i give it an 8/10. christian propaganda...lots of fear mongering... this is not scifi, this is chrifi (christian fiction).the movie started out ok but took a sharp christian right turn. from then on it was all about god, jc, the holy bible and the devil . the ufo\\'s are really just demonic deception to fool people in to believing that there is other intelligent life in the universe. satan\\'s idea is to trick you in to thinking that there could be more to life than what is in the bible. the abductions could be used to explain away the rapture. the people left behind would believe it was a mass alien abduction, instead of god taking all the christians to heaven. no reason to repent if its aliens. the deeper message in the movie is that if you don\\'t believe in god and have jc in your life than you believe in nothing and your life has no purpose. this dvd is missing its calling as a heineken coaster.... this is a great example of why no one should ever go see a sequel with a different director/writer than the original. two hours of this turkey left me begging for exorcist 2 reruns. no legitimate laughs. not one decent scare. the script was just a mess and i felt bad for the actors who had to perform it (they must have had sick relatives at home or monster coke habits or something). the original was a makeup effects landmark. so naturally, the producers of the sequel thought it would be a great idea to to scrap makeup fx and do cg werewolves instead. these cg werewolves had me laughing a lot harder than any of the \"comedy\". it was just a total miss. if ya want a night\\'s entertainment, go rent the original again. or go take a film class and make your own horror film. you\\'re bound to do better than these fools did. this incredibly formulaic flick from the \"walker, texas ranger\" squad contains some of the most unbelievable scenes ever witnessed within a tv movie. in addition, one can pretty much predict the outcome from the get-go. however, it\\'s a fun little movie that gets the job done: it entertains. that\\'s all it was meant to do and it does so. the stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot isn\\'t half bad. the acting is also decent, which isn\\'t much of a surprise, because everyone knows that chuck norris is no steven seagal. if you\\'re a fan of the genre (and of \"walker, texas ranger\"), you will definitely love this. if not, then don\\'t waste your time. 8/10 karen (sarah michelle gellar), an exchange student in japan who is just beginning to do some social work, is sent to aid an elderly semi-catatonic woman, emma (grace zabriskie), after her previous caretaker, yoko (yoko maki), disappears. karen soon learns that something is not right in emma\\'s home, and she attempts to \"see how deep the rabbit hole goes\". maybe it\\'s a delayed influence from the success of m. night shyamalan\\'s films, but slower-paced, understated horror films are a recent trend. in some cases, such as hide and seek (2005), the approach works remarkably well, and in others, such as white noise (2005), the pacing tends to kill the film. i didn\\'t like the grudge quite as much as hide and seek, but this is still a very good film--it earns a 9 out of 10 from me. the grudge has a couple significant differences from other recent examples of that trend, however. one, it is well known that this is a remake based on the japanese film series that began with ju-on (2000) (in particular, it\\'s extremely close to the first half of ju-on: the grudge, aka ju-on 3, from 2003). two, as with many japanese horror films, the slower pacing here isn\\'t so much in the realm of realist drama as with surrealism. as is also the case with a large percentage of european horror, the grudge should be looked at more as a filmed nightmare. director takashi shimizu, also the director of the five japanese entries in the ju-on series to date (the fifth is currently in production), and writer stephen susco have largely dispensed with linearity and are not overly concerned with logic or plot holes when it comes to the horror behind the story. the idea instead is to present a dreamlike sequence of scenes, with dream logic, where the focus is atmosphere, creepiness, the uncanny, and for many viewers--scares. how well the film works for you will largely depend on how well you can adapt yourself to, or are used to, this different approach to film-making (although admittedly, some of the seeming gaps are filled in by previous entries in the ju-on series). traditionally, american audiences consider as flaws leaving plot threads hanging and abandoning \"rules\" for the \"monster\". a more poetic, metaphorical, surreal approach to film isn\\'t yet accepted by the mainstream in the u.s. however, even if you\\'re not used to it, it\\'s worth trying to suspend your normal preconceptions about films and give the grudge a shot. this is a well written, well directed, well acted film, filled with unusual properties, such as the story interweaving a large number of \"main characters\" (which is done better here than the more episodic ju-on 3), good cinematography, subtle production design touches (check out gellar\\'s clothes, which match the color and texture of the exterior of emma\\'s house, when gellar first approaches), and beautifully effective horror material. even though it is more slowly paced that your average horror film of the past, the pacing usually enhances the eeriness, and there is no shortage of bizarre events to keep horror fans entertained. the supernatural premise of the film is absorbing, and based on interviews on the dvd with shimizu, have prodded me to pay more attention to japanese beliefs and folklore. although the most interesting subtexts would probably arise with a more intimate knowledge of japanese culture, it\\'s interesting to ponder why so many japanese horror films feature scary children and adults who look like scary children. i subtracted one point for the film slightly veering into clichã©d mystery/thriller territory with a \"here\\'s what really happened\" flashback, but even that was fairly well done, and otherwise, this would have been a 10 out of 10. now that i\\'ve said all of the above, let me finish with a mini-rant: it\\'s not that i\\'m anti-remake, but it is ridiculous that u.s. distributors and studios feel that we need remakes of foreign films to make them appropriate for consumption. the original versions of these films should just be playing in u.s. theaters in wide release. there is no need to present an almost identical film but just substituting white american actors for non-white or foreign actors. yes, the grudge is a fine film, but ultimately, i\\'d rather see something original using this talent, and be treated to the latest foreign horror films--not just japanese, but also indian, spanish, chinese, etc.--at my multiplex. in the hope that someone with some pull at the studios reads this, it is also more cost-effective to do this, as (1) you can completely avoid production costs, and simply make domestic distribution deals from which you receive profit, and (2) you can make money off of fans like myself who otherwise pick up the foreign film dvds in foreign manufactured or even bootleg versions. this movie is pure guano. mom always said if you can\\'t say anything nice... but even mom would say i had to do my part to warn others of this movie. i can guarantee this is the film that geoffrey rush wishes would just go away. i would hope that greg kinnear fired his agent..from a cannon for giving him the script. after this ben stiller is probably praying for someone to pitch \"there\\'s still something about mary.\" i have always been a fan of wes studi\\'s, thank whatever you hold holy that he wore a mask through the film so maybe people won\\'t identify the film with him. it starts of promisingly with a stylistic spoof of the cinematography of the batman films and then just loses something...like a coherent plot and half decent effects. the jokes are telegraphed an hour before the punchline comes, and even then they fall flat. if you want to see an effective spoof of the comic book world see \"chasing amy\". run! don\\'t walk away from \"mystery men\"! a group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original -- and while there is a bit of originality and some skilled drawing in this slacker puppet show take on \"dante\\'s inferno,\" there is nothing especially clever. dante\\'s \"divine comedy\" was a brilliant piece of social commentary. this film is a vaguely moralistic student film with pretensions to high art. i suspect those who loved this film were those readily amused by the sophomoric pokes at some icons of the political and/or religious right, and that those who hated it took offense at seeing their favored icons poked. be that as it may, few of those pokes actually rose to the level of satire. the high point of the movie is a sudden outbreak of \"schoolhouse rock\" on the subject of lobbying and the \"revolving door.\" it\\'s really a shame that the entire film couldn\\'t have been a musical. that would have stripped away a great deal of the annoying film school pretentiousness and added a far stronger element of fun. the title of my summary pretty much covers my review. this is to me what teenage mutant ninja turtles was to someone 5 years older. while i missed out on that little pop-culture wave, i embraced the toy line and t.v. series that was mighty max with both arms. you wanna know how into this i was? i went as mighty max for halloween. thank god for the internet. thanks to demonoid, last week i was able to watch this great show from my childhood for the first time in over a decade. i\\'m watching this right now, having just been blown away by recognizing rob paulson of animaniacs, and am also loving the celebrity humor in \"tar wars\". 4 minutes in, and they have already mentioned, by name: clint eastwood, governor arnold, dustin hoffman, john wayne, and ace ventura. hells yeah. damn, it is only upon writing this that i realize there is no way in hell i can give this series anything less than a perfect score. any imperfections have been lost in the fog of time. this is my childhood. this is awesomeness. this is the mighty one. i have never seen a comedy that was this much of a chore to sit thru...not one laugh in it. ok, maybe one little chuckle for the michael clarke duncan bit as the big, black, bald gay virgin. but the rest of it was shockingly un-funny. on top of being void of any laughs the \"skits\" go on forever! steer clear of this one if you value your time and money. dreadful!!! the worst!!! this is a great \"small\" film. i say \"small\" because it doesn\\'t have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions, as in a john woo film. great performances by roy scheider and the three \"bad guys\". john frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days. the film is very easy to watch, the story is more of a yarn than a washing machine--instead of everything going around and around, it seems as though things just get worse as the plot thickens. wonderful ending, very positive. i never read the elmore leonard book, but it can\\'t be much different from the film because it feels like i\\'m watching an elmore leonard movie. a very sensitive topic--15 y/o girl abandoned by mother as a baby and who goes to visit her, continues to be ignored, is raped by her mom\\'s boyfriend, becomes pregnant. there was not enough depth displayed of this situation. too much of time is taken up on the chase with the truckers transporting the baby. (interesting, this baby with asthma--you never see him cry-- except once--, be fed, have is diaper changed during the whole truck transport ordeal.) i would have liked to have seen more of the interrelationships, more focus on the fact that this girl was a minor--this should have stood up in court immediately. and this was a true story! it deserved a better telling than that!! if it weren\\'t for the subject matter, i would have given this closer to a 0 rating. i rented this from the library. only later i found out it was a made for tv movie. oh well i\\'m glad some people liked this, but i hated this film. it had a very good idea for a story line, but that\\'s where it ended. it was badly written, badly acted and badly made. it had some interesting plot points, but they were just skipped over too fast, the writers needed to realize what to keep in and expand on these bits, like lying about why she was kidnapped, and ditch the dross. instead it was \"what\\'s going on?\", 5 seconds later they tell you. this film had no suspense, and i was bored from start to end. i just wanted it to finish. go and rent misery, or best laid plans if you want suspense or twists that keep you guessing to the end. what fun! bucketfuls of good humor, terrific cast chemistry (skelton/powell/lahr/o\\'brien), dynamite dorsey-driven soundtrack! miss powell\\'s dance numbers have exceptional individual character and pizzazz. her most winning film appearance. the palestinian situation is fertile and as-yet largely fallow soil for film-making. \\'divine intervention\\' tries hard, and gives us an insightful peek into the almost surreal life of those caught up in the troubles, but the film amounts to little more than a handful of (admittedly lovely) visual jokes thrown onto celluloid, while the links between them become increasingly obscure as the film progresses. a missed opportunity to say something more coherent about a very topical issue. this film stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of cinematic romantic comedies. it is virtually flawless! the writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are all wonderful! even the music -- from dean martin to la boheme -- is captivating and delightful! every character is peculiarly delightful and memorable, from the leads played by cher and nicolas cage, to the many supporting roles -- olympia dukakis , vincent gardenia, john mahoney, danny aiello -- even grandpa with his dog pack! each of these performers, plus norman jewison as director, performs above their normal quality in this ensemble work. for several of the actors, this was an early major exposure in film, so the casting is also exceptional -- and we have many current acting powerhouses whose careers were altered by their effectiveness in this film. i\\'ve seen this film several times all the way through -- which can sometimes deflate the impact of a film substantially. more tellingly, i realized some years ago that whenever i channel-surfed my way into a scene from this film -- any scene -- the scene was compelling and beautifully crafted. there are so many stunning and memorable scenes the original meeting between the cher and nicolas cage characters, where cage tells his tale of woe; vincent gardenia discovered with his paramour at the opera, amidst the splendor generated by his gold-mine plumbing business; olympia dukakis scolding john mahoney for philandering with his student in the classic line about liaisons with co-workers: \"don\\'t sh-t where you eat!\"; danny aiello at his dying mother\\'s bedside; nicolas cage \"taking\" cher as the rapture of an aria soars in the background! there are of course many great romantic comedies, among them sabrina (both versions, but especially the audrey hepburn/humphrey bogart/william holden original); when harry met sally; the apartment. none quite equals moonstruck! in many ways, the filmic career of independent film-making legend john cassavetes is the polar opposite of someone like alfred hitchcock, the consummate studio director. where hitchcock infamously treated his actors as cattle, cassavetes sought to work with them improvisationally. where every element in a hitchcock shot is composed immaculately, cassavetes cared less for the way a scene was figuratively composed than in how it felt, or what it conveyed, emotionally. hitchcock\\'s tales were always plot-first narratives, with the human element put in the background. cassavetes put the human experience forefront in every one of his films. if some things did not make much sense logically, so be it. one can see this even from his very first film, 1959\\'s shadows, filmed with a 16mm hand-held camera, on a shoe string budget of about $40,000, in manhattan, with cassavetes\\' acting workshop repertory company, and touted as an improvisatory film. the story is rather simple, as it follows the lives of three black sibling manhattanites- benny (ben carruthers)- a trumpeter and no account, hugh (hugh hurd)- a washed up singer, and lelia (lelia goldoni)- the younger sister of both. the film\\'s three main arcs deal with hugh\\'s failures as a nightclub crooner, and his friendship with his manager rupert (rupert crosse); benny\\'s perambulations in an about manhattan with his two no account pals; and lelia\\'s lovelife- first with a white boy tony (anthony ray), who does not realize light-skinned lelia\\'s race, even after bedding her; then with stiff and proper davey (davey jones), who may be a misogynist. in the first arc, nothing much happens, except dark-skinned hugh gets to pontificate on how degraded he feels to be singing in low class nightclubs, and opening shows for girly acts. he dreams of making it big in new york, or even paris, but one can tell he is the type of man who will continue deluding himself of his meager skill, for the one time we actually get to hear him sing, he shows he\\'s a marginal talent, at best. that rupert keeps encouraging him gives us glimpses into how destructive friendships work. but, this is the least important of the three arcsâ…. while this film is better overall than, say, martin scorsese\\'s first film, a decade later, who\\'s that knocking at my door?- another tale of failed romance and frustrated new yorkers, it has none of the brilliant moments- acting-wise nor cinematographically- that that film has. it also is not naturalistic, for naturalism in art is a very difficult thing to achieve, especially in film, although the 1950s era manhattan exteriors, at ground level, is a gem to relive. while shadows may, indeed, be an important film in regards to the history of the independent film circuit, it certainly is nowhere near a great film. parts of it are preachy, poorly acted, scenes end willy-nilly, almost like blackout sketches, and sometimes are cut off seemingly in the middle. all in all it\\'s a very sloppy job- especially the atrocious jazz score that is often out of synch with the rest of the film, as cassavetes proved that as a director, at least in his first film, he was a good actor. the only reason for anyone to see shadows is because cassavetes ultimately got better with later films, and this gives a clue as to his later working style. the national film registry has rightly declared this film worthy of preservation as \\'culturally significant\\'. this is all in keeping with the credo of art cassavetes long championed, as typified by this quote: \\'i\\'ve never seen an exploding helicopter. i\\'ve never seen anybody go and blow somebody\\'s head off. so why should i make films about them? but i have seen people destroy themselves in the smallest way. i\\'ve seen people withdraw. i\\'ve seen people hide behind political ideas, behind dope, behind the sexual revolution, behind fascism, behind hypocrisy, and i\\'ve myself done all these things. so i can understand them. what we are saying is so gentle. it\\'s gentleness. we have problems, terrible problems, but our problems are human problems.\\' that this film is \\'culturally significant\\' is true, but that truth is not synonymous with its being \\'artistically significant\\'. it is in the difference between these two definitions where great art truly thrives. the distribution was good, the subject could have been interessant and comic. whereas, he described the wandering of an old non credible communist looking for loving sensations. instead of this, the atmosphere is nor lively nor heavy. this movie starts out hilarious from about the 15 second mark, and continues it throughout the movie. i cannot recall a scene where i didn\\'t turn to look at people laughing with me. he is the perfect actor for this roll because of the way he looks and the way he dressed. the comedic parts were great to see from actors not very big or popular. as you can see people do like this movie it is currently rated 7.9 on imdb. i think it should be in 250. lets put it this way i haven\\'t seen this funny of a movie since american pie or the original vacation. see it if you want a laugh. i give this movie 2 of the highest thumbs up i have ever given since i found out about imdb, great movie site. \"this story is dedicated to women,\" according to the introduction, \"who have been fighting for their rights ever since adam and eve started the loose-leaf system.\" when \"politics\" was filmed, the nineteenth amendment, guaranteeing women the right to vote, was only a decade old. and, the film deals with the wielding of political power by women as a voting group. advocating prohibition, and shutting down speakeasies, was a main concern for women at the time. good-natured marie dressler (as hattie burns) becomes politically active, after a young woman is shot and killed coming out of a speakeasy. she wants the liquor-selling joints closed; and, is drafted into a mayoral run, after delivering a powerful speech at a women\\'s rally. ms. dressler is supported by her tenants, best friend polly moran (as ivy higgins) and her stuttering husband roscoe ates (as peter higgins). dressler\\'s run for mayor of lake city draws opposition from men in town; so, dressler orders the women to go on strike, denying them, \"everything\" in the \"parlor, bedroom, and bath.\" the film sounds much better than it turned out. the humor, frankly, isn\\'t too good; and, it features some unfunny and moderately offensive situations (\"you look like madame queen\" refers to an amos and andy character). and, the mixing of shootings and slapstick doesn\\'t mix well, this time. producers might have considered making the film more dramatic, focusing exclusively on dressler and the characters played by william bakewell (as benny emerson) and karen morley (as myrtle burns). **** politics (7/25/31) charles reisner ~ marie dressler, polly moran, roscoe ates at the beginning of the film, you might double-check the dvd cover and re-read the synopsis a couple of times, but no worries. it\\'s not \"memoirs of a geisha\" that you purchased; just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be. still, the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie, as it shows how in the year 1840 a samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery. he decapitates the two lovers before doing some hara-kiri (ritual suicide through disembowelment). cut to present day, when the american ambassador in japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago. from then onwards, this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional. let\\'s start with the good aspects, namely the original japanese setting and the presence of the delicious susan george who is my all-time favorite british horror wench (well, together with britt eckland, linda hayden and ingrid pitt). the bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent, imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter. the restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff. the spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into susan\\'s ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress! in this \"possessed\" state, she even lures the american ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests. so, strictly spoken, it\\'s not really \"evil\" that dwells in the house; just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their long-dead hands! obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening, especially since the light-blue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in \"ghostbusters\". \"the house where evil dwells\" is probably the least scary ghost movie ever. throughout most of the running time, you\\'ll be wondering whether director kevin connor (who nevertheless made the excellent horror films \"motel hell\" and \"from beyond the grave\") intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and over-the-top, like \"motel hell\" maybe. but then again, everyone in the cast continues to speak his/her lines with a straight and sincere face, so i guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed. \"the house where evil dwells\" is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesn\\'t even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning. i am fully aware of how shallow it sounds, but the two scenes in which susan george goes topless are the only true highlights. well, those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over-sized spiders (or are they crabs?) in the daughter\\'s bedroom. how totally random and irrelevant was that? if you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation, make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep. trivia note for horror buffs: keep an eye open for the demon-mask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant japanese horror classic onibaba. this is the follow-up creation to better off dead. in a competition, better off dead would win hands-down. but for star power, one crazy summer outshines savage steve\\'s better script. problems with one crazy summer (ocs): casting. better off dead (bod) was cast so much better. friendship: ocs shows cusack giving hateful looks to bill murray\\'s little bro. trouble on the set?? more outrageous friends in ocs, but more genuine friends in bod. plot was good. you\\'ll predict some of it, but even the predictable parts go further than you think they could. so, even though this is better off dead\\'s ugly stepsister, it\\'s worth a look. see demi moore before the plastic surgery if for no other reason. john cusack fans, you gotta see it, just to say you have. if you don\\'t like bobcat golthwaite, i\\'m sorry. i don\\'t like him either, but you can\\'t escape him in this one. at least he does a great job in the film doing a tribute to another movie monster. editing needed help on the beach, but for most part, not much to complain about. overall, it\\'s good and funny. but try not to compare it to bod or you\\'ll find it lacking. *sigh* if this film had a budget of 20 million i\\'d just like to know where the money went. a monkey could make better cgi effects then what was wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful piece of garbage, although i must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really, really cool on an original play-station 1 game, and early pc games from the mid 90s if a game had ever been made. what puzzles me is where did the money go? pendragon films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la george lucas circa 1975-83, and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing (or ruining in this case) for about the same 20 million. this is quite possibly the worst film ever made! i would rather sit through a 24 hour repeat screening of ishtar than watch this film again. i hated it completely! i regress. i say this is the worst film ever made because unlike other bad movies like plan 9 or killer tomatoes, or santa claus conquers the martians, these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them, you love them. there is no love for this film and no place in my dvd library for it. i sold it to a guy for a dollar. i\\'m betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew. shame on you pendragon films! i want my money back! if you want to see a movie about two utterly unsympathetic characters, this is the one. the acting is superb, both from john cassavetes as the insane paranoid whom, as the saying goes, they really are out to get, and from peter falk as his lifelong best friend to whom he turns for rescue. big mistake, but since they\\'re both amoral mobsters, and misogynistic bastards to boot, it\\'s hard to decide whom to root for less. only writer/director elaine may could have gotten away with this one. i thought it interesting that in a lengthy interview with producer michael hausman included on the dvd, he disclosed that the two stars had \"very different ideas\" about the script, that the director was nearly impossible to work with, that the director of photography had impossible demands made of him, that the crew was constantly angry about being made to sit around waiting, and so on. this mood of one big very dysfunctional family comes across clearly on the screen. good, boring or bad? it\\'s good. worth your money? if you can spare it for a ticket, sure. better than the trailer makes it seem? yes, oddly. there isn\\'t much to the script - guards working at armored truck company move vast amounts of cash. guards see opportunity to retire as millionaires, one of them is too honest to go along with it all, and a well-laid plan goes to hell. this could have been a poorly-executed reservoir dogs ripoff, but the skill of the cast and the director\\'s ability to make just about anything tense pull it out of that realm and put it onto a solid footing. the movie seemed a little slow at first. but it picked up speed and got right to the point. it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the \"gadget\". i enjoyed it. it is very close to reality as any movie about the atomic bombs that were to be dropped on japan. i have recommended it to friends. i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz. my rating refers to the first 4 seasons of stargate sg-1 which are wonderfully fresh, creative and addicting. when the cast stepped through the gate, you never knew what lay on the other side! starting around season 5, the show took a different focus - still good, but different. the series follows the adventures of a team of humans (and one alien) who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the \"stargate\". the backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie \"stargate\" in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in egypt. the episodes are light (innocent and easy to watch) and very creative. many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great sci-fi movies of their own. what happens next was always unpredictable. the characters on which the show rests are also well-defined and brilliantly performed. their tone is serious, but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor. they are simply fun to watch. starting somewhere around season 5, the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe (the goa\\'uld, then the ori). the plots become more complex (a lot more political/strategic oriented) and interdependent. the characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature. one thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the 100th and 200th episodes. they are simply can\\'t-miss shows. they exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through 10 seasons. if you are a sci-fi fan, watch a few episodes of the first 4 seasons and you\\'ll likely be hooked. if you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides, you have 10 seasons of shows to look forward to. this movie should have never been made. what a shame of the budget. please hire convincing actors, and make a proper movie. very thin plot, and unconvincing lines. almost hilarious, and that is a shame for an action movie.... definitely not worth watching. they keep replaying the same \"shots\" of an stealth airplane flying away. you have seen it ones, and that was not worth re-running 3 or 4 times. it is time for steven seagal to retire from movie-making. his movies are getting worser every time. black dawn, and submerged were already bad, but this movie is even worse. every kid has that movie that he pops into vhs when he has nothing to do, or when there is a babysitter around. this was that movie for me. i can tell you the whole plot exactly, i must have seen it 100 times at least, and i can say it is a good kids/family movie. i still have the tape, i haven\\'t watched it in 5 years, but maybe i\\'ll get around to it this week, and be a kid for the day. you just have to love the care bears, and their messege. idea is great, spoiled big time by the judges. why make fun of people? if what the inventors say is true, and as most of them say, they spent their life saving on the invention, the minimum is to reject the idea without making fun out of the people. also, it shows when they want to accept an idea by the crier that they added to the judges. the only one i respect out of the judges is the one who always sits on the right of the table, he is a respectable person of course the english snob who claims to be a business man, wearing a suite doesn\\'t make you one pal last but not least, the big guy who sits between the english and the crier. wake up man, the is no job called and inventor for you to call yourself one. an inventor is an attribute not a job man. i think they wanted to add someone like simon from the american idol, they thought it worked there, it can work here as well. the context is different and the idea is totally different. it is a good idea and they could have done a good show out of it if they just change the judges and remove their act and attitude. just stop making fun of the people. although i don\\'t like cricket at all and i have seen this movie 13 years ago, i still think it is one of the best coming-of-age movies ..i remember the day i returned home from my school and sat down to have my lunch, i saw the opening titles of that movie and then....i was so immersed in it that i felt i was there, it really affected me personally. i still remember how i felt when i first saw it ,i felt that the poor boy was a friend of mine, going through the same adolescent experience we were having in those days. what i really liked about that movie is the main theme of a \"shy\" boy fantasizing about \"kissing\" his dream girl, no offense but if that was an american movie, you would certainly see-at a certain point, mainly climax- the \"shy\" boy \"making love\" to his girl, and i really can\\'t grasp this contradicting concepts till now...i have a simple request ,if anyone knows how to get this movie on a dvd by mail ,please let me know cause i need a shot of memories..thanks late night on bbc1, was on my way to bed but curiosity piqued at a contemporary-set irish film so i stayed to watch for a few minutes and then stayed to the end. i have to admit that the main attraction was the only english actress, kelly reilly, who is stunning to look at. this is billed as a black comedy, which is one of the hardest things to pull off. it should be the perfect blend of horror and horrible laughs so that in the end you don\\'t know why you\\'re laughing - for me martin scorsese\\'s after hours (1985) is the best example. dead bodies is more black than comedy but the plot rattles along and spirals down towards further blackness. i didn\\'t spot the final twists in the tale as some other posters here did so i was suitably surprised. as a snapshot of the irish film industry in 2003, it all seems rather worthy; it doesn\\'t look like they spent too much on the making of it so it had a chance to make its money back. the script could\\'ve been a whole lot sharper but the acting was on the whole pretty good. i\\'m glad i watched it, flaws and all, tho i don\\'t think i learnt much about ireland today, especially their policing methods! hi, i\\'m a friend of werewolf movies, and when i saw the title of darkwolf hitting the shelves i was like \"hmm, simple and nice name to it at least. althou... i wonder why i haven\\'t heard of it before.\" first of all, the movie starts with tits. lots of tits. tits are pretty much all this movies budget went to. who cares about a werewolf effect, just pay the actresses enough to get topless shots! so, about the mysterious darkwolf character (a little spoilers ahead, but who really cares...) he\\'s your average everyday biker. not even super-tough looking, but like the old wise woman says in the movie \"he is far more powerful and dangerous than you\\'ve ever faced before.\" just by describing her a tattooed biker-type of a guy. pretty original. i even had look twice when they first used the \"red glowing eyes\" special effect! i mean my god, that \"lets-plant-red-dots-on-eyes-with-computer\" effect has been used since the seventies. it looks plain ugly here! and don\\'t get me started with the werewolf 3d-cgi. as said before, like an bad and old video game. and finally, as i do like werewolf films, like i said. they prettymuch always build a werewolf-legend of their own. darkwolf does build the werewolfworld as well, about some silly legends of hybrid-werewolves and the ancient bloodline. but. it almost instantly after creating the rules of engagement \"the darkwolf kills anyone the girl has touched\" starts random-slashing. which just doesn\\'t make any sense, why even bother telling us the rules of killing, when they aren\\'t even gonna play by them... aplus the wolf-point-of-view shots are made with a sony handycam or something, filming mostly the floor and walls. just add growling noises and you\\'ve got a super werewolf effect. the gore is partially ok. but when the wolf slashes everyone with an open hand, just by basically laying the hand on top of the victims, it just doesn\\'t do the trick for me... truly, who gives money to make these heaps of junk straight-to-video horrortitles, they aren\\'t even funny-kind of bad movies, just sad. i had noticed this movie had been on cinemax a lot lately, so this morning, i decided to watch it. i had just finished the infiltrator, which is a great movie, and i thought this looked good as well. from the description the cable had, atleast. this film was awful. it\\'s slow, the pacing is horrible, it feels as tho it lasts 4 hours. there\\'s no real plot to speak of...agh! how can anyone say anything good about this movie. rickman is good...but he always is...the other two characters work well, but there\\'s no real story to support any of it. after 2 hours, and you sitting there wondering what on earth is going on, where on earth is the plot- it ends with a surprise that frankly just made me sick. don\\'t bother with this one. tenchu aka. hitokiri- directed by hideo gosha - starring shintaro katsu and tetsuya nakadei belongs (together with goyokin, hara kiri & rebellion) to the best chambara movies existing. its the story about shintaro katsu (who plays okada izo) working for nakadei, who wants to become the daymio. okada, being the \"cleaner\" for nakadei is being treated like a dog - and after quite a while he realises - what he realy is to nakadei. but there is so much more in this movie - every fan of japanese cinema should have seen it !!!!!!! (tenchu means heavens punishment) wow, did this episode start on a stooooopid premise! the enterprise is chugging along when all of the sudden, abraham lincoln is floating around in space and welcomes the enterprise!!!!!!! is it just me, or is this a really lame-brained idea?! lincoln comes aboard and they welcome them. abe suggests they beam down to some barren planet, where they meet other famous dead folks--both good and evil. it seems that a really cheesy-looking rock monster has assembled a team of good and evil people to battle it out for supremacy. the whole thing seems really daffy and inherently unfair, as the good side is saddled with surak--a vulcan who makes gandhi seem like rambo!! despite a totally awful premise, the action is pretty good and it\\'s great to see overhead shots of obvious doubles fighting it out in this grudge match. but, don\\'t mistake this for high art or deep sci-fi. the bottom line is that the series was on its last legs as a first-run series and this really looked like they dusted off this turkey and filmed it regardless of the absurdity of the premise. this pile of sh!t is tied in my book as the worst thing ever made. i can\\'t believe that someone actually relased this crap, let alone acually made it. horrible, horrible, horrible. not even worth mentioning the damn story or any details about it. that\\'s how bad it actually is. avoid it like sars! all the kids aged from 14-16 want to see this movie (although you are only allowed at 18). they have heard it is a very scary movie and they feel so cool when they watched it. i feel very sad kids can\\'t see what a good movie is, and what a bad movie is. this was one of the worst movies i saw in months. every scene you see in this movie is a copy from another movie. and the end? it\\'s an open ending... why? because it is impossible to come up with a decent en for such a stupid story. this movie is just made to make you scared, and if you are a bit smart and know some about music, you exactly know when you\\'ll be scared. when the movie was finished and i turned to my friend and told (a bit to loud) him that this was a total waste of money, some stupid kid looked strange at me. these day i could make an oscar with a home-video of my goldfish, if only i use the right marketing. claire denis\\'s movies seem to fall into one of two categories: the violent and bloody or the quiet and intimate. \"l\\'intrus\" definitely falls into the first category, but it\\'s not so awful as \"trouble every day\" or \"j\\'ai pas sommeil.\" now, ever since i saw \"chocolat,\" i\\'ve made it a point to see every new movie denis makes. and i have always been disappointed. \"l\\'intrus\" was no exception. she has yet to make a movie as personal and as moving as her first one. you get a lot of the denis regulars: an older but still magnificent bã©atrice dalle who seems to be in the movie only to show off her full lips, the gap between her teeth, her ample cleavage, and a couple of nice coats; the black guy from \"trouble every day\" and \"j\\'ai pas sommeil,\" grã©goire colin, and that lithuanian or russian girl. michel subor\\'s character was interesting enough, but the camera lingered on him at such length that i got annoyed by that curly forelock of hair hanging over his forehead and was relieved when, somewhere in korea, i think, he finally got it cut. there was certainly some action--gruesome murders, a man\\'s search for a son--and there may even have been a plot, but one viewing wasn\\'t enough to figure it out, and two viewings are, i fear, out of the question. for one thing, the score was jarring and obtrusive (as in \"beau travail\"). for another, the seasons changed too abruptly, leaving you even more confused about what was going on. oh, there were a few pretty shots, and if you liked \"friday evening\" with its shots of the folds in heavy drapes and bedsheets, you might appreciate the aesthetics of \"l\\'intrus.\" otherwise, steer clear. i saw this movie in french and it\\'s possible i missed something crucial. but the dialogue in a denis movie rarely amounts to more than five pages, double spaced and with ample margins. in \"chocolat\" the silence is sublime; in \"l\\'intrus,\" it\\'s just dull. this film was on last week and although at that time of the day (around 6pm) the quality of the movies is almost never good (at least here on mexican tv), i couldn\\'t switch the tv off. the story about madelene moore really touches you. she doesn\\'t come across as a very sympathetic character at first, but seeing the whole film, you just want her so succeed. this film really leaves you thinking. and i think that basically due to the great acting of brooke johnson. i had never heard of her before nor knowingly seen her in another film, but this was great great acting. compliments to brooke. i hope to see her in another film soon. i agree with the other comments. i saw this movie years ago. christopher plummer is hilarious as a dandy. the ribaldry is unsurpassed. if this comes out on video, i will definitely buy it. i have had the opportunity to catch this independent film and was impressed with it, despite the lack of excitement in the plot. the acting was very good by everyone involved. amy madigan played the part of a guilt ridden mother who is tired, yet well intentioned and determined to make up for her younger daughter\\'s condition. yet, in the process, she has neglected her older sister, who is more interested in playing with her savant-syndrome sibling and living in a world of escapism. the men in the movie are very powerful in their secondary roles. christopher lloyd, in a very understated role, shows us why he has such versatility. he plays a teacher who is dedicated to his profession and literature research, yet starved for a meaningful relationship. he and madigan connect very well in their scenes together, yet both know nothing more can come from their friendship. their wordless goodbye is nothing short of brilliant, an acting lesson for aspiring performers. and in a small role, fred savage is fun to watch. you can tell why this movie was based on a play, it\\'s probably very good on stage. on screen, it\\'s not particularly exciting, but it\\'s nonetheless very thoughtful and powerful in its subtleties. still the definitive program about the second world war, the world at war isn\\'t just long, but also very informative. the series contains 26 episodes (each episode lasts for about 45 min.), and includes the events leading up to and following in the wake of the war. most episodes are about the war in europe, and there are several episodes about the war in the pacific. other episodes include information about the wars in africa, burma, the atlantic and the home fronts of germany, great britain, united states and soviet union. there is one episode that\\'s dedicated to the holocaust. the series starts off with the episode a new germany (1933-1939), and tells about the rise of the nazis in germany and german territorial gains prior to the outbreak of war. the series ends with the episode remember; the war\\'s influence in a post-war world. remember is a fitting episode to end this great program. every episode begins with a short introduction and then with opening credits. the credits are accompanied by a powerful music theme. there are many fitting music pieces throughout the series. each episode is like a mini-film. the footage is fantastic, and so is the way it was put together. in addition, some of the footage is in color. the information included also makes the episodes memorable and entertaining. the series was produced by jeremy isaacs for thames television (uk). commissioned in 1969, it took four years to produce, such was the depth of its research. the series was narrated by laurence olivier (one of the most famous and revered actors of the 20th century). the series interviewed leading members of the allied and axis campaigns, including eyewitness accounts by civilians, enlisted men, officers and politicians, amongst them albert speer, karl donitz, jimmy stewart, bill mauldin, curtis lemay, lord mountbatten, alger hiss, toshikazu kase, arthur harris, charles sweeney, paul tibbets, traudl junge and historian stephen ambrose. jeremy isaacs says in \"the making of the world at war\" that he sought to interview, not necessarily the surviving big names, but their aides and assistants. the most difficult subject to locate and persuade to be interviewed, according to isaacs, was heinrich himmler\\'s adjutant, karl wolff. the latter admitted to witnessing a large-scale execution in himmler\\'s presence. the world at war is often considered to be the definitive television history of the second world war. some consider it the finest example of the documentary form. in a list of the 100 greatest british television programmes drawn up by the british film institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, the world at war ranked 19th. the program has everything that the viewer needs to know about the war. after watching a few episodes i liked the series so much that i tried to watch the remaining episodes one after the other. i\\'ve seen some of them several times. there are two other great documentary series that i know of that may be of interest to the viewer. one is called the great war (1964) that\\'s about world war i. the other is called cold war (1998) that\\'s about the cold war obviously. i have seen \\'the sea within\\' today and i loved it. the actors of the movie are wonderful (specially javier bardem, of course), but i thought that belã©n rueda would have a better role. lola dueã±as, clara segura and, specially, mabel rivera perform excellent interpretations. and i cannot forget celso bugallo and joan dalmau (brother and father of the protagonist). there are two technical aspects i loved very much: aguirresarobe\\'s photography and the score by amenã¡bar himself. i liked the song, \\'negra sombra\\' (\\'dark shadow\\'), by luz casal with music of carlos nãºã±ez. in short, i think that the spanish academy should choose \\'the sea within\\' in order to compete in the oscar awards. i liked other spanish productions, such as almodã³var\\'s \\'bad education\\', but amenã¡bar\\'s film is much better than them. \\'the sea within\\' deserves all the awards. as someone who has read the book, i can say that this is vastly inferior to the big american version starring gwyneth paltrow. there are various reasons for this. firstly, emma is too unpleasant. yes, she has faults, and isn\\'t the easiest person to like - but the viewer shouldn\\'t downright start to despise her. secondly, mr knightly is miscast. his brooding and melancholy in this version are better suited to a bronte or gaskell adaptation than austen, and throw the mood of the whole affair \"off\". thirdly, samantha morton is too strong an actress to be relegated to the role of harriet; and why was she made to look so sickly? harriet is supposed to be blonde and blooming - not to look as if she\\'s going to be carried off by consumption in the next scene. fourthly, the structure has been mucked up and scenes cut. at the end, when emma decides she loves mr knightly, it comes across as utterly baffling because this narrative hasn\\'t been adequately shown and carried along throughout the film. fifthly, what was going on, exactly, with mrs elton\\'s accent? she went from sounding like an american actress trying to suppress her own accent at the beginning, to all out american half-way through, and then back to english at the end. finally, this dragged at the end. the book and the big film version end with the wedding of emma and mr knightly. this version drags on confusingly after the announcement of the wedding without actually showing us the ceremony. all in all, a rather haphazard attempt. read the book or rent the paltrow version instead i\\'m not a huge fan of lucio fulci\\'s films. most of his 80s gore films had their moments, but often came across as second-rate dario argento imitations. with the exception of the entertaining \"zombi\" (which was a george romero imitation), i didn\\'t really enjoy them. i know italian horror often disregards the plot, but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards. this is why \"don\\'t torture a duckling\" surprised me. its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery. its possibly the best giallo ever made, only seriously rivaled by dario argento\\'s entries into the genre. and unlike fulci\\'s previous giallo \"a lizard in a woman\\'s skin\", this never drags. fulci\\'s direction here is quite good. he keeps the story moving at a good pace and maintains the viewer\\'s interest throughout. also, the conclusion to the mystery comes as a complete surprise to the audience. plus, he adds some clever touches, such as the upbeat soul music during a particularly disturbing graveyard beating sequence. overall, the violence here is restrained and only used when necessary for the story. the acting is good for the most part also, full of familiar faces from 70s italian exploitation cinema. both thomas milian and barbara bouchet are super cool throughout. the only weak link is florinda bolkan, whose performance is just far too over-the-top. its the only laughable aspect of the film. \"don\\'t torture a duckling\" definitely comes with my recommendation and may be a good introduction to the giallo subgenre as a whole. (8/10) this film without doubt is one of the worst i have seen. it was so boring that i simply could not wait for it to end. i talked my girlfriend into watching it after this site had good reviews and after even 30 mins in she looked at me as if to say \"your nuts\" the scenery was as boring as the film with nothing but driving around in the car looking at the wind blowing bits of bush around. the acting was un-inspiring and the film was simply a waste of what have been a good idea into a waste of a dvdr. guy pierce should have stuck to neighbours as at least he washed his hair. all he done was talk on his phone but yet sold nothing as a salesman. he would have been sacked weeks before. his girlfriend (once in coyote ugly) should have remained dancing on the bar as at least she looked hot in that. the guy who played vincent (those who watched know) was so annoying with his phone calls that any normal person would have drove to his house and hit him with a bit of 4 by 2. i do not on this earth know what anyone liked about it. i actually want people to watch this to suffer the torture i went through. unlike another user who said this movie sucked (and that olivia hussey was terrible), i disagree. this movie was amazing!!!!!! olivia hussey is awesome in everything she\\'s in! yeah she may be older now, because many remember her from romeo and juliet, but she\\'s wonderful! this story line may be used quite often, but it\\'s a unique movie and i\\'ll fight back on anyone who disagrees! i enjoyed this movie just as much as i have any other olivia hussey movie. olivia\\'s \"my girl\" and i love her work. i saw this for the first time on saturday (4/14/07) and fell in love with it. not only because\\'s it\\'s an olivia movie, but because of it\\'s unique story line and wonderful direction. if you speak french or can put up with sub-titles, you will really enjoy this movie. if on the other hand you just want to see god\\'s most beautiful creatures, this is a must see. not an ounce of silicon in sight. zalman king eat your heart out. sophie marceau\\'s body is the epitome of perfection and everything i had ever fantasized about. her part is even in english. even the fact that she was nude with john malkovich did not detract for her beauty. sophie is a ten if ever there was one. chiara caselli and inã©s sastre are 9.5s. oh yeah, it is a pretty good story. several little vignettes are woven together in a sort of six degrees of separation style. this is the first porn i\\'ve ever tried to review. it demands a different approach than usual, since the allegory will not reward dissection. \"i\\'m american. i\\'m a prudish virgin.\" \"we are european. we are cultured and sex-mad.\" \"it is nice when we all screw each other.\" lots to talk about! well, there kind of is in fact, relative to your average 60s topless volleyball number anyway. and the enervating patina of \\'class\\' at least delivers clean, detailed compositions. but what the hell kind of thing is that to say about a porn? ok then: the only scene i really (rhetorically) got off on was the first time brigitte maier steps in. there are efforts to toss in a nice variety of race and age while letting no two men anywhere near each other; the one black guy suffers a premature bout of editorial coitus interruptus. and multiple takes or not, one perhaps undescribable-on-imdb act does look like it was partially simulated by a surgical hose. still, i stayed awake, and it was eight in the morning...but what does the last shot mean?! i have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind. the trauma, the suspense is just amazing. i ended so wound up in the psychological fear and philosophy of it, and relating it to reality. movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you don\\'t forget, those that make you doubt your reality. a problem could be the quality, but that doesn\\'t bring down the essence of the movie. the idea it self is brilliant and the ending leaves you just completely shocked and with the question for you to seek the answer. i just totally loved it! so many clues and twitches and puzzles. one of the best movies ever, hands down. this film stands as one of the most amazing examples of compelling and artful film-making i\\'ve every seen. herzog seems to capture the almost transcendent tragedy and beauty of dieter\\'s story, as well as his endearing personal character. by the end of the film, i was left wishing that i\\'d had the opportunity to meet dieter before his passing. on a technical note, the cinematography is intimate and astoundingly beautiful. the narrative is intricately woven, with great awareness of the subject and his capacity for reliving and reenacting traumatic events. few documentary directors have so strong an ability to so thoroughly invest the audience in the character. this film is a must see!!! a small town is attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty vampires. the only hope is a lone avenger and a group of ragtag survivors. released in 1993, \"darkness\" garnered something of a cult following upon release. it\\'s easy to see why-it\\'s loaded (and i mean freaking loaded) with gore, and it\\'s energy and enthusiasm, like that found in other no-budget cult horror flicks like \"the dead next door\" and \"the children of ravensback\", is actually rather infectious. while that may be true, that\\'s sadly not enough to save it. the film was shot on a super 8, so the image is grainy and dark, making things very difficult to see (it would have been great if it had obscured the protagonists dreadful mullet.) also grating is the soundtrack, made up of annoying casio keyboard and even more annoying death metal (seriously, what is it with these no budget horror flicks and bad death metal?) while one isn\\'t expecting oscar worthy performances, the acting is still strictly amateur hour, as the actors sometimes seem almost confused instead of frightened or threatened. in the end, i\\'m sure fans of no-budget gorefests will love this. everyone else though, will wish there was a little more meat on the ribs. i can understand after watching this again for the first time in many years how it is considered one of the worst laurel & hardy\\'s. for me, it isn\\'t as close to as bad as \"air raid wardens\" and \"the bullfighters\", but there are some definite huge flaws in it. the film is set up to show laurel and hardy as the owners and instructors of the dance studio. hardy is funny as the prancing lead of a \"london bridge\" dance, surrounded by 20th century fox starlets, while in the next room, laurel teaches the beginners ballet while wearing a ballerina outfit. a clumsy carpenter spills glue on the floor, leading to a predicable gag where hardy ends up the looser. then, in come the racketeers, now selling insurance covering up their protection racket. one of them is a very young and handsome robert mitchum. but no sooner do they bully the boys into buying insurance, they are arrested. this is the end of the gangsters and the last time we see the dance studio. the rest of the film is devoted to laurel and hardy\\'s support of wealthy patron trudy marshall and her inventor boyfriend, robert bailey. they first try to help them hide their relationship from her disapproving parents (matt briggs and margaret dumont) and hopeful suitor allan lane, whom we can tell right off is a no-good swine. this leads to briggs\\' hidden bar being revealed to tea-totaling dumont, and a gag where a rug is literally pulled out from the wealthy patriarch which crashes his bed into a pond below. when bailey uses the boys to help display his ray gun, pandemonium ensues. the dead-pan butler announces to case and dumont that their house is on fire. later, hardy wants to use the insurance policy to gain money to pay their dance studio rent and hopes to get laurel to break a leg to do so. there is no reference to the fact that the insurance salesmen were gangsters and that the policy would probably be invalid. (even if they were to have become legitimate insurance salesman, after being arrested, their licenses would have been revoked). laurel ends up getting off a bus which had been abandoned by the driver over a supposedly rabid dog (only a frosting covered, cake devouring toto look-alike, or possibly the actual pooch), causing oliver to end up on a huge beach roller-coaster that somehow the bus has ended up on, perfectly fitting its wheels onto the tracks. roller-coaster gags can be exciting, as evidenced in \"abbott and costello go to hollywood\", and this one is amusing but anticlimactic. as the story wraps up, all of these gags seem to have no point, giving the impression that this was simply a series of one-reelers put together to make a full-length feature, hopefully part of a double bill. l&h, as i\\'ve mentioned in other reviews of their later films, had lost much of their luster after leaving hal roach\\'s employ, but surprisingly here, they do not come off as old and tired looking as they had in films made in the same year. had the gags not been as amusing, as was the case with some of their other films, this surely would have ranked a \"2\" as opposed to a \"3\". sadly it was misguided. this movie stunk from start to finish. it was hard to watch because i used to watch clarissa explains it all every day on nickelodeon. i loved her. then the next thing i found she did a spread in maxim and she was gorgeous! i haven\\'t really heard anything about her until i watched this movie on accident. i couldn\\'t believe she would even let something like this be seen with her name all over it. everything about it was wrong but it still looked like someone somewhere in the team was trying really really hard to save a sunk ship. too bad.. i hope she continues to act and i would love to see her with a real cast in a real movie. if you have beloved actors, peter falk, rip torn, george segal, and bill cobbs, you don\\'t need billy burke, coolio, or any other distractions. massive talent is totally wasted in \"three days to vegas\", with the blame falling squarely on the script. my neighbor\\'s vacation films are about as interesting as this misguided road movie. if you want to see how to utilize a veteran cast with a good script, check out \"the crew\". there really are no redeeming factors here, and watching these wonderful actors struggling with such weak material is a crime. i wanted to like it, but the shallow script cheats the audience, by essentially giving the actors nothing to work with. - merk i just can\\'t understand the negative comments about this film. yes it is a typical boy-meets-girl romance but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just flies by. henstridge (talk about winning the gene-pool lottery!) is as magnetic and alluring as ever (who says the golden age of cinema is dead?) and vartan holds his own. there is simmering chemistry between the two leads; the film is most alive when they share a scene - lots! it is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get together... ignore the negative comments - if you are feeling a bit blue, watch this flick, you will feel so much better. if you are already happy, then you will be euphoric. (ps: i am 33, male, from the uk and a hopeless romantic still searching for his princess...) rock star / (2001) *** (out of four) by blake french: \"rock star\" is the story of a nobody who becomes propelled into fame, only to realize living his dream is not the way he imagined it. we have seen all this before (in better movies), but this human story does capture the world of rock and roll with a brutally honest and insightful edge. it garners a recommendation because of its visualization of the atmosphere. the script, by \"crazy/beautiful\" director john stockwell, portrays the hard-core universe with memorable images-it doesn\\'t explain what it is about, it shows us. \"rock star,\" originally titled \"metal god,\" stars mark wahlberg as chris \"izzy\" cole, a pittsburgh office supplies salesperson who dreams of becoming bobby beers, the fiery lead singer for the heavy metal rock group, steel dragon. although chris already sings for his own tribute rock group called blood pollution, instead of writing his own songs, he insists on performing only those by steel dragon, and only in the exact way they perform them. his group becomes irritated with chris\\' obsessions and gives him the boot. this devastates chris, as well as his supportive parents and faithful girlfriend, emily (jennifer aniston from tv\\'s \"friends\"). he then receives a phone call. it\\'s the steel dragon band. they have seen chris\\' tapes and want him to replace the recently fired lead singer. in an instant, chris rockets into the dizzying world of sudden stardom-from the biggest rock fan to the biggest rock star. unfortunately, it\\'s not as rewarding as he expected. a true story inspired the \"rock star\" concept. an ohio supply salesman, tim \"ripper\" owens, really did replace rob halford, the lead singer in judas priest, after initially singing for a tribute band. the rest of the film is probably fiction, although most of what happens must represent the experiences of many other bands. the film details the various ordeals of being a rock star. it explores the aspects of touring, personality differences, the danger of drug abuse and violence, struggling relationships, sexual freedom, dishonesty, and the extreme measures of the producers all to please the fans and keep popularity high. i have seen all of mark wahlberg\\'s movies, and this is the first that has earned my affection. wahlberg, a former singer/model, has made movies like \"fear,\" \"boogie nights\" \"three kings,\" and most recently tim burton\\'s lacking remake \"planet of the apes.\" i am starting to admire the young actor more and more. although he has not performed in many successful films, he has taken many chances, and done a variety of roles. \"rock star\" is his best film to date. i can\\'t think of many actors who could have convincingly portrayed chris cole\\'s struggles and aspirations. wahlberg truly makes \"rock star\" rock. jennifer aniston lights up the screen as well. she creates a chemistry-rich relationship with chris that induces audience participation. it\\'s tragic of what happens to their relationship. we care about these characters a great deal. during the film concert scenes, director stephen herek (who also directed \"holy man\" and the live action version of \"101 dalmatians\") creates a gripping atmosphere. he captures the scenes with an intense urgency, and a raw, unmistakable energy. the musical numbers provide the film with the best, most involving scenes. unfortunately herek cannot sustain the energy and zest throughout. at the three-quarters mark, he looses the spark as the movie becomes dull and unpleasant. i understand where the story needs to go in order to portray the negative side of fame, but this movie loses everything it previously had going for it. in \"almost famous,\" a much better film about rock and roll, there is a certain amount of interest and life in even the most sorrowful scenes. here, it feels as if the filmmakers lose their passion. the message comes a bit too late and suddenly in the story. the film turns into a morality tale that wants to provide us with a sappy destination. the filmmakers might as well stop everything, appear on screen and say: \"now audience, the moral of the story isâ…\" we understand the theme, but it\\'s too instantaneous. the personal discovery for chris\\' must be gradual. fortunately, all of this happens in the last twenty-five minutes of the film, hardly enough to completely destroy an entire eighty-five minutes of a reasonably good feature. \"rock star\" is not a great movie-see \"almost famous\" if you want a remarkable film about rock and roll-but for marky mark, it\\'s a turning point in his career. i just found out before writing this review that \"komodo vs. cobra\" and another movie called \"curse of the komodo\" were both directed by the same guy, jim wynorski. that might explain why they are films of nearly identical premises. they both feature a military-governed island, a colonel whose concerned more about covering his tracks than the lives of his employees, people racing to get to a chopper that is conveniently lying in a field somewhere on the island, and giant komodo dragons created through genetic experiments running amok. what differences are there? well, the intruders on the island are now capitalists wanting to expose the government secret and there\\'s a giant cobra on the island as well, hence the title \"komodo vs. cobra\" even though the conflict between the two monsters is hardly relevant to the \\'story.\\' \"komodo vs. cobra\" is more or less what you\\'d expect given its title and its channel origin: the sci-fi channel. although every now and again you will find one that for one reason or another may appeal to you (i liked a movie called \"komodo\") i hardly doubt this one will. \"komodo vs. cobra\" is not only a boring film, but it\\'s also one of the least enthusiastic sci-fi flicks i\\'ve seen in a long time. in some of these movies, there is an air to them that indicates the filmmakers were giving at least a certain level of effort, but i see very little here. that\\'s indicated again by it just being a rehash of \"curse of the komodo.\" the cgi for the monsters look as if they came straight out of a second-rate video game, the cinematography and misc en scene is poor, the acting ranges from passable to poor, the action scenes are dull, and then there are some parts that are, frankly put, unforgivably bad. i see a lot movies where a person will shoot a gun many times without reloading and i can deal with this. but in this movie, where michael parã© takes a single thirty-eight handgun and fires it approximately fifty times nonstop without reloading onceâ…well, at first i laughed, but even then it just became tiring. that would be the \\'action.\\' a monster appears, people scream, parã© fires nonstop without reloading his gun once throughout the entire picture, and somebody gets eaten. \"komodo vs. cobra\" is a very bad movie. the only thing in the movie that is worth mentioning in a charitable manner is an actress named michelle borth, who is not only very beautiful, but a surprisingly strong performer. even with the trashy dialogue and lack of enthusiasm in the screenplay she was given, michelle borth managed to pull off a surprisingly good performance and it just appalls me that an actress as good as her can get stuck in a film as junky as this. she obviously took it for the paycheck, but it won\\'t boost her career any, i\\'m afraid. yes, it feels, and for the most part plays like an \"after school special\", for a slightly more adult audience, alright maybe a teen audience. but add in bill murray (already showing some dramatic as well as his usual comedic talent), a nice supporting cast, and an unexpected sweetness about growing up, and remembering those great, or not so great days at summer camp, and you get a heartwarming, funny, sleeper hit. it does get a little too smarmy for its own good, but that is also one of its charms. when you hear the title \"meatballs\", and see the poster, you expect a teenage sex romp, but what you get is a sentamental, yet sometimes sexy look back at those formative years at summer camp. the sentamentality, and the remberances of simpler times reminds me of \"a christmas story\", which i also love. the rememberances of summer camp were never so well stated. the only movie i\\'ve seen that comes close, is \"indian summer\", which i like almost as much as \"meatballs\", and also stars matt craven. let\\'s hope he completes the trilogy. maybe he could come back for \"return of the meatballs\", and bring some dignity back to the franchise (meatballs 2 through 4 bare no resemblence to the original classic). \"meatballs\" is easily on my top 10 guilty pleasures of all time (not really guilty either). it\\'s a wonderful little film, that always makes me smile. i think this show is screamingly funny! it\\'s not for every taste, and i\\'m not going to elevate or denigrate the folks that don\\'t get it. i\\'m sure they\\'re wonderful bright people that operate at a different wavelength. but if you like it, you really like it. sarah plays a self-infatuated loser named \"sarah silverman\" who often finds her self in homerian predicaments (that\\'s \"homerian\" as in \"homerian simpsonian\"). i remember sarah silverman from her brief gig on saturday night live in the early 90\\'s. i liked her immediately then and i go out of my way to check out anything she\\'s done. this show is choke-on-your-food-and-wet-your-pants funny. therefore i always fast before watching it and wear adult diapers. check it out! okay, so there is a front view of a checker taxi, probably late 1930s model. it has the great triangular shaped headlights. there also is a desoto cab in this black and white, character driven, almost a musical love gone wrong story. the real pleasure here is the look at 1940s room interiors and fashions and hotel elevators. the hair styles, male and female are gorgeous. if dolly parton had victor mature\\'s hair she could have made it big. there is an artist loft that would be the envy of every andy warhol wannabe. if you watch this expecting a great casablanca storyline or sound of music oom-pah-pah, you will be disappointed. there is a nice little story beneath the runway model approach in this film. my copy on dvd with another movie for $1 was very viewable. the title sequence was cute but not up there with mad, mad, mad, mad world or the pink panther. this was an rko movie but it did not have the nice airplane logo that rko used to use. i liked victor mature in one million, b.c., and sampson and delilah and especially in violent saturday. see if you can find that one. he was wonderful in the comedy with peter sellers called caccia alla volpe or after the fox. richard carlson went on to do i led three lives on tv in the early 1950s. vic mature was offered the part of sampson\\'s father in the remake of sampson and delilah. he supposedly was asked if he would have any problems playing the part of the father since he was so well known as sampson. victor replied, \"if the money is right, i\\'ll play sampson\\'s mother.\" tom willett the original female convict scorpion is an all time masterpiece. the first sequel, jailhouse 41, was not quite as good in my opinion, though it\\'s still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style. director shunya ito has managed to do the same thing again with this film; the story is a bit different here, but still he\\'s managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it. again the action focuses on nami matsushima (a.k.a. \"scorpion\") and this time she\\'s out of the jailhouse and not too keen on the idea of going back. after escaping from pursuing police officers, one thing leads to another and scorpion finds herself getting it together with a prostitute and her retarded brother. the prostitute ends up getting impregnated by the retarded brother (...), while scorpion is kidnapped and caged up by someone who she made an enemy out of in prison. but scorpion doesn\\'t like spending time behind bars and it\\'s not long before she\\'s back to doing what she does best. the film gets off to a great start as we see scorpion hack the arm off a copper intent on taking her back to jail. from there, however, the film slows down a lot and beast stable ends up being more of a drama than the previous two films. that\\'s not to say that there isn\\'t still plenty of action - scorpion still spends a lot of time in \\'revenge mode\\' and the film isn\\'t exactly short on general sleaze. meiko kaji once again reprises her role as the sinister title character and it\\'s another understated, almost wordless performance. her screen presence is great, however and she manages to have a menacing presence despite being only small physically. the plot structure for this film is similar to the other two in that it all builds into a crescendo of revenge. there are more people who have angered scorpion in this film than in the previous two so this section takes up a fairly large part of the film. there\\'s a few surreal sequences, not as many as in the first film and nowhere near as in the second, but the film stays in with the rest of the series on that point. overall, i would say this film is between the first two in terms of quality - not as great as the original and slightly better than the second. 1 thing. this movie sucks big time..i was into singaporean comedy when chiken rice war came along. but, this time, even gurmit singh (well-done) acting cant pull this one of. a total failure of following hk\\'s shaolin soccer. next time: do ur own thing! everything is idyllic in suburbia when the little family moves in, as the father have got a new job in a computer company there. but no paradise would be complete without its snake. strange things happens as the family joins the local country club without the husband, as it certainly holds secrets. the father is not a joiner, but pressure is on him to join, as everyone who is anything in the neighborhood and at work are members. robert urich\\'s good guy part is a bit tepid, but joanna cassidy as good natured housewife turning nasty sizzles. suspenseful and well-made chiller with a bitchy susan lucci as club chairperson. look out for cult favorite michael berryman in a bit part as a valet. the movie captures the sense of paranoia and the special effects final is worth waiting for. i have seen this movie quite a few times. neil simon\\'s the odd couple set up a model for many of his later plays. felix unger and oscar madison were the unsuitably paired roommates in the original, the former being picky and neat, the latter being slovenly and loose. simon would rewrite (less successfully) the play in the 1990s as the new odd couple, with female roommates. he made it a mixed couple (a woman with her daughter, and a man) in the goodbye girls. he also gave it an additional twist in 1973 with the sunshine boys, a broadway hit starring jack alberson and sam levine as al lewis and willie clark, the aged, semi-retired vaudevillians. here the \"apartment\" problem is reduced to a teaming of two men who can\\'t stand each other. the 1976 film starred walter matthau as willie, and george burns as al. in actuality, al probably does not think totally badly of willie - willie is pathological on the subject of al. first al had little habits, such as accidentally spitting slightly when pronouncing words beginning with the letter \"t\", and slightly jabbing willie with his index finger, on stage. secondly, al retired when his wife died. willie was not ready to retire (and has been forcing his nephew and agent, ben (richard benjamin) to try to get him jobs in commercials. but willie can\\'t remember lines unless they are funny, and keeps flubbing them. so he rarely is able to stay to the end of a rehearsal for a commercial. ben is asked to get the two back together for a live scene of their most famous sketch on a television show about american comedy. he does bring al to see willie, and the sparks begin flying, as neither can figure out what the other is doing (and this is just in rehearsal. on top of that, willie is insisting on changes (minor ones, but they throw off al) such as saying \"enter!!!\" when al knocks on the door. the initial rehearsal is a failure, but ben manages to get them to the taping of the show. the question is if they will complete the scene in the finished program or will willie wring al\\'s neck? the three leads, matthau, burns, and benjamin, do very well with the one-liners, frequently reminiscent of vaudeville patter (example: \"chest pains...i\\'m getting chest pains uncle willie. every thursday i come here and get chest pains!\" \"so, come on fridays!\"). benjamin strives to prove his deep affection for his uncle, although matthau\\'s rough outer shell makes it difficult (he only smooths down when he discusses the glory days of vaudeville). matthau has a little better grasp on reality (at first) than burns, who seems senile by his repeating himself - but in actuality matthau\\'s sense of rejection by the world that once applauded him make him less willing to behave properly. burns is not senile - he takes things slowly. but he seems far happier in accepting his retirement. i call this a final \"voyage of discovery\" for our modern lewis and clark. al and willie transcend their old skits, as they gradually end up realizing that they have more in common in their old age than they thought. even the irascible willie admits that al may be (to him) a pain in the ass, but he was a funny man. burns was not the original choice for the part of \"al lewis\" (supposedly dale of the team smith and dale). jack benny was. benny probably would have done a good job, but ill-health forced him out (he died in 1975). burns (whose last involvement in any film was in the solid gold cadillac in 1956 as the narrator) turned in such a fine performance that he got the \"oscar\" for best supporting actor, and was to have a career in movies in the next decade in such films as oh god!; oh god, you devil; and going in style. he died in 1996 age 100, having proved that he was more than just a brilliant straight man for his wife gracie allan. this astonishing waste of production money is filmic proof that the rich and famous can be just as stupid and wasteful as politicians. from a (silly) play by tennessee williams and directed (with a dead hand) by joseph losey and starring taylor and burton and noel coward - this project filmed in a spectacular cliff-top mountain island mansion in the mediterranean must have seemed a sure fire winner when presented to universal in 1967. the result is so absurd and tedious that it almost defies belief. visually the film is spectacular but that is the force of nature that has allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set. the shrill antics of a screeching taylor, burton\\'s half asleep wanderings, the loony dialog, noel coward laughing at himself, the ridiculous story and plot devices and the absurd costuming simply irritate the viewer. boom is a disgrace, a waste of money and talent and clear proof that lauded famous people can be idiots just like the rest of the planet\\'s plebs. not even fun. just terrible and mad shocking waste. this film is self indulgent rubbish. watch this film if you merely want to hear spoken gaelic or enjoy the pleasant soundtrack. watch for any other reason and you will be disappointed. it should be charming but isn\\'t - it\\'s just irritating. the characters are difficult to care about and the acting is poor. the stories within the film are also charmless and sinister. i was expecting a heartwarming family film but this also held no appeal to my fourteen year old daughter. it is rarely that i cannot see a film through to its conclusion but this one got the better of both of us. although the film is set in current times it has the look and feel of a cheap east european film made during the cold war. there isn\\'t even enough in the way of beautiful scottish scenery and cinematography to redeem it. a real shame because as a film this is an embarrassment to scotland. a plot that is dumb beyond belief. however, that said, it must be admitted the lead actors go at their roles as though it were shakespeare. and that is as it should be. it isn\\'t their fault the writer seems to be in a coma. hats off to what is really a very cunning performance by joanna kerns. she proves that just because it isn\\'t on the page doesn\\'t mean a role can\\'t be seized and dug into. and she does so with gusto. good for her. ditto to christine elise who is called upon to be little more than confused and weepy, but goes way beyond what is asked of her by the script. and to grant show as well. a graduate of daytime and prime time soaps (ryan\\'s hope, melrose place). he is always versatile and underrated. his primary drawback seems to be his impossible-to-ignore good looks. he is a sturdy, well grounded actor capable of much more than he is generally given the opportunity to do. the rest of the cast is basically window dressing. the direction is adequate and the script, as i alluded to, is fairly idiotic. watch this one to enjoy three good actors in the leads taking delight in performing some much needed scenery chewing. it\\'s fun. excellent movie in many aspects. vicente aranda has succeeded in depicting the time (1830) with meticulous care. the light, the places, the feeling, are perfectly perceived from the very start of the movie. and along with it -in opposite to what happened to \"mad love\" (juana la loca), a rather episodic historical movie- all of this beautiful photography/ music/ clothes is wrapping a very fluid screenplay that reaches its climax in the only possible way. concerning the actors, paz vega as carmen is outstanding: liar, seductive, agressive, totally sexual, so beautiful carmen. sbaraglia is a little less convincing the audience about his instant mad love for carmen, but he succeeds in conveying the proper tragic mood to the whole movie. i recommend it to everyone: the best spanish movie of the year. as a premise, this backwoods version of the dead calm storyline had promise. however, director eric red\\'s inability to render a convincing hurricane leads to a deluge of continuity and lighting errors. ultimately, the viewer is more spellbound by the bizarre weather effects than the intended storyline. intermittent spates of ham-fisted over-direction are similarly distracting. charles dance, doing an \\'inbred backwoods hardass\\' schtick, does his best to save the movie. but ultimately, undertow squeals like a pig ... and has more ham to boot. mickey rourke ( who was once a famous movie star ) plays martin fallon an ira terrorist who accidentally blows up a school bus full of children who is so disgusted by his actions decides to leave the ira and goes on the run in london !!!! mild spoilers !!!! the movie\\'s opening is rather disturbing as the lives of little children are ended in a fireball . things like this happened throughout the 1970s and 1980s and into the 1990s in northern ireland which gives a prayer for the dying a stark realism . however as soon as fallon decides he\\'s going to give up violence ( what ? he\\'s a terrorist and he\\'s never blown up innocent passerbys before ? ) realism disappears and clichã©s and ridiculous plot twists take place . martin is employed by the london underworld ( don\\'t they have their own hit men ? )to commit a hit while he wears an ira \" uniform \" ( never knew the provos wore uniforms ) at a cemetery in broad daylight ( wouldn\\'t an ira man use a bomb placed under a car ? ) where he\\'s spotted by a priest who recognises him while he was in the sas . hands up who thinks i\\'m lying ? i\\'m not and we\\'re half way through the running time and there\\'s still several clichã©s to come this all sounds very silly and it is but what do you expect from a novel by jack higgins ? everything is clichã©d , contrived and stereotypical and the bits that aren\\'t are just plain bizarre . the critics slaughtered this movie when it came out , most notably they stated that it might have some potential if the movie had bob hoskins playing gangster jack meehan and alan bates playing the sas soldier turned priest and for once the critics would have been right . they should also noted the film might have been less dire if fallon was played by someone who was capable of doing an irish accent . rourke might be hunky and macho ( oh gawd another movie with an ira uberhunk ) but accents aren\\'t his strong point any more than character acting is . to give you an idea how disappointing prayer for the dying is the director ended up disowning it which is always a bad sign as a footnote the original release of prayer for the dying in britain was delayed for several months because of \" the enniskillen bombing \" . in november 1987 the provisional ira exploded a bomb in the centre of enniskillen where a remembrance day parade which commemorates britain\\'s war dead was being held . eleven ( 11 ) people were killed and scores more injured . it wasn\\'t an accident and no one left the ira because of it in the literal sense.... reminds you of those \"cops-and-robber\" or cowboys-indians\" role-playing games you played with your 8 year old friends. tedious and un-inspired, the storyline was obviously written to make bad acting and dialogue seem as part of the plot, but all it does is showcase it. i cant believe john badham let his name be associated with this piece of crap. this could have been done better by a high school film buff who had been given the camera lighting, filmstock and editing destined to be a time-filler on sci-fi channel, when they\\'ve overused everything else from their library, and barely better than the paid programming shill downstream. 1. aliens resemble plush toys and hand puppets, while having arms that don\\'t function. 2. aliens mastered intergalactic space travel, but they don\\'t know how to push an unlocked vault door open, yet can push open a door being held shut by five people. 3. old security guards know how to get a hold of c4, and are just waiting for the right time to use it, say, when they are suddenly fired for no explainable reason. 4. apparently, us army boot camp, in the 80\\'s, involved several sessions of \"garden tool combat\", including the pirouette spin of death. 5. to impress your prudish girl friend, you have to \"save the world...err...neighborhood\" from aliens. 6. all women are sluts, either openly or secretly. 7. scummy night clubs look like bad diners. 8. \"scummy\" waitresses double as dancers for the fontanelles (how did they get talked into this?) who can only do bad 60\\'s dance moves. 9. army privates secretly dream of being rambo. 10. grenades apparently have a setting for \"flash-bang\". 11. being burned alive apparently only leaves one with minor burns on their arms. 12. us army staff sargeants apparently happen to always be in the area and do nothing about aliens in the area. 13. aliens apparently always \"go home\", which means back to the vault they were un-locked in. 14. aliens are attracted to bright lights, which apparently means in the los angeles area one would assume, the protagonist\\'s house is the most brightly lit thing in the area. 15. showing 16 parking scenes in a movie makes the audience clamor for more. 16. vans from the 80\\'s apparently have horrible suspension systems. 17. comedy is supposed to happen in this film. 18. horror is supposed to happen in this film. 19. spoofs and homages are supposed to happen in this film. 20. this film cures insomnia. 21. apparently, garden tools make electronic keyboard noises whenever they are used, not just in fights (tell me i\\'m not the only one who noticed this). the simply truth is this film just came out wrong. period. there isn\\'t much meat on the bone, nor does it do anything really well. even average. it\\'s just bad. however, i\\'ve seen far worse, and the rake fight scene is pure comedy gold, intentional or otherwise. 2/10 - jaws 4 was worse then this. at least the film never took itself seriously. i would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances. i just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who fleeces sinuoeh, the lead character. i remember a mini-biography of this actress following the movie the last time i saw it. apparently, she was a holocaust refugee, discovered by a french husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty. she died very young and under tragic circumstances. gene tierney is also outstanding in this film. like other neo-biblical films of the 1940\\'s and 50s, \"the egyptian\" reflects the morals and values of that time, but is still great entertainment because the performances are terrific and the story so well told. one of the worst movie i have seen in 2009 so far: the story hesitates between a silly thriller or a dumb comedy. as nothings happens, the void is filled with long, boring dialogs that don\\'t make any sense! the cast is famous but doesn\\'t bring any emotions except to fast-forward the play! and it happens in a plush seaside hotel that looks really gloomy. in comparison, the one of the \"shining\" is funfair! nb: a lot of users think that it is located in the french riviera! they are wrong! it isn\\'t the south of france (nice, cannes) but totally the opposite: cabourg & normandy, to be simple the beaches of the d-day! that\\'s why the sea is as grey as the sky and there isn\\'t sun! i had no idea what this movies was about, it jumps from plot line to plot line erratically linking incoherent ideas with one another. it simply doesn\\'t make sense. the chopped up time line doesn\\'t help either. we start in present day get a flash back to the past and then return to the future only to go back into the past. this movie is also filled with horrible sappy lines and clichã© themes such as princess and the pauper, \"you cant have me even in my death\" lines, \"you don\\'t even love me enough\" line. clichã© to the max! fighting scene were horribly corny, lighting was constantly misplaced which offset the cg with the actors (meanning you could tell some of the backgrounds were clearly cg). although the society in di moon was quite interesting. i wouldn\\'t really recommend his to anyone, avoid if possible. if you found this comment hard to follow, the movie would be equally as bad. the folks at aardman have done a cool, cute and wild adaptation of their short films of wallace and gromit to feature length, as the man and his dog, inventors who seem to have more of the intelligence (or practicality) for the latter. in this case they\\'ve invented a machine that can capture all of the bunnies that are eating up the crops all over a quiet english village. in particular for mrs. tottington (or \\'totty\\' for those who are \\'intimate\\'), much to the chagrin of victor quartermaine, who just wants to kill all the rabbits with his trust rifle. wallace and gromit seem to have success with their machine, but wallace has a mix-up: a machine he\\'s made to make more food suddenly criss-crosses himself with a rabbit - the curse is on! a lot of this is about as much light-hearted fun that a kid\\'s movie could ask for, but it also tips its hat to the oldest tradition in classic cartoon slapstick: looney tunes, which in turn is indebted to much silent comedy and vaudeville. granted, the aardman guys (nick park and steve box) have a bunch more gimmicks and tricks and ingenuity with their material. it\\'s never less than amazing to see how they put the stop motion to use, even when a joke or a gag might be a little on the funny \"ho-ho\" not funny \"ha-ha\" side (a tired criticism but i\\'ll say it). curse of the were-rabbit works so well on all fronts for the audience, in its warped story and sudden dips into exposition (the golden bullet story is a doozy), park and box and company never lose sight of glee in the material. it\\'s fuzzy and warm-hearted and completely off-the-wall for the kids (even the very youngest will love the adventures and strange gadgets, such as the truck wallace and gromit drive around in), and for adults there\\'s little barbs of funky, absurdist tones in the midst of a classic english farce. only (and i\\'m probably a minority opinion here) when compared to chicken run it\\'s almost a little slight a work- there\\'s less any plot than there is a series of running gags, and of course lots of puns involving bunnies and monsters and carnivals and cheese (and horrible men with egos in their guns like the fiennes voiced quartermaine). but when it strikes best, it\\'s one of the most entertaining films of 2005. it gives me a big goofy smile anytime it\\'s on tv. another weak third-season entry, \\'is there in truth no beauty?\\' nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very different and as spock would say, fascinating. the main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane. it\\'s too bad the episode cannot live up to this incredible premise. obviously, i think, it was a mistake to ever \\'show\\' the alien, as its actual visage in no way even approximates such a daunting build-up; all we get is the standard star trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar. in any event, kollos\\' appearance can at least be tolerated by mr. spock, and then only if spock is wearing a special visor. (for the longest time, i thought the alien\\'s name was \\'carlos,\\' which i found humorous, but i digress.) spock is required to mind-meld with kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the enterprise back to safety. this is accomplished, but when spock/kollos go back to end the mind-meld, by golly, spock forgets his visor. uh oh. he goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of kollos\\' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers. this might have been a really bizarre, excellent episode but it is poorly directed and comes across as yet one more badly executed show of the series\\' last season. this movie is trash-poor. it has horrible taste, and is pedestrian and unconvincing in script although supposedly based on real-events - which doesn\\'t add much of anything but make it more of a disappointment. direction is not well done at as scenes and dialogue are out-of-place. not sure what robin williams saw in this character or story. to start, williams is not convincing as a gay in a relationship breakup nor is the relationship itself interesting. what\\'s worse, his character is compelled by an ugly pedophile story that is base and has no place as a plot device. you have an older rory culkin tastelessly spouting \"d_ck_smker\" - in good fun- which is annoying enough and then laughed up by the williams character. finally you have sandra oh as a guardian angel adviser to williams and a thrown in explanation of the whole fiasco towards the end. toni collete\\'s character is just plain annoying and a re-hash of her 6th sense performance with poorer direction. very miss-able. this movie \"vampires: the turning\" isn\\'t even really worth the 2 out of 10 i\\'m giving it. the movie, is very predictable from beginning, up to the very end when our hero kills the leader of the vampire slayers. the use of music in this movie was even bad, it kept playing as if you were to expect something significant to happen at any second, though it never did. the acting, was b-rank at best... and the movie was just, dull. the only reason i give this movie a 2 out of 10 is because the story, had potential though it ended up unable to deliver. oh, and did i mention the wardrobe? the wardrobe for this movie was obviously cheap to \"non-existent\" because our hero, and his girlfriend (whom he\\'s trying to save throughout the entire movie) wear the same outfits through the entire movie. i\\'d suggest this film only if your really bored, and don\\'t have a good wall with fresh paint to watch dry. ~dave, the horror cowboy a new guard in in the armored truck gig is recruited by his co-workers to steal 42 million from the truck. no bad guys, so no one will get hurt, right? of course things go wrong and the new guard decides to have a conscience and make things right by saving the life of a dying man. i\\'ll admit that i didn\\'t really have any interest in this film, but i didn\\'t have any interest in fantastic mr fox either, and that film made my top ten of the year. armored is even more of a disappointment then i thought it would be. as a heist film, it fails to deliver the goods, it\\'s boring and full of plot holes and leaps in logic that one will hurt themselves thinking about it. despite this the film somehow has a really great cast, but the film doesn\\'t even use this to it\\'s advantage. everyone seems wasted in wooden characters that make stupid choices. columbus short is an uninteresting lead that is never charismatic and never makes the audience want to give a crap. matt dillon is the mastermind behind the heist and he plays mr. nice guy at first, then when things don\\'t go his way he quickly becomes the villain. the rest of the impressive cast include lawrence fisburn, jean reno, skeet ulrich, fred ward, amaury nolasco from prison break and milo ventimiglia from heros. non of them do much and when they actually do something, it\\'s without much reasoning behind it. the film is relatively short, but even with it\\'s running time under 90 minutes, it felt dragged out. how long can you make a movie about a guy trapped somewhere? phonebooth did a decent job and it was even more restricted. the leaps of logic concerning the plot here are tragic. 42 million and all the security they have are check ins every hour or so? the entire plan from my understanding was to drive the trucks into an abandoned warehouse and hide the money. pretend to get hit and burn the trucks. they would then walk away with the money. of course something goes wrong, or there would be no movie right? through a series of unfortunate events out so called hero has trapped himself inside the truck with an injured officer. the rest of the movie is dillion and his crew banging on the doors to get in. how very exciting. the script calls for our hero to have financial problems, he might lose his house, which would in turn make him lose his brother. you see, both their parents died and it\\'s just the two of them looking out for each other. so now he has a reason to join the heist. at first he didn\\'t want in, but his money problems is just the right push to throw him in the thick of things. how convenient. armored\\'s whole spin on the heist genre is that it\\'s from an armored truck, from the guys who drive it. after that basic premise, the film falls flat on it\\'s face. i found myself wanting it to end sooner and sooner each time someone spoke. speaking of the ending, it sucks. skip it. for a really wonderful movie, you could also try seeing the movie about saint francis of assisi - good for any audience. best thing i liked about this movie was the mexico landscape, & it gets the movie up to a 2. i was surprised that these actors didn\\'t have terrible sunburn, they were so were not desert dwellers. and moses is said to have a speaking impediment, but certainly not here. even the \"miracle\" scenes were contrived & un-believable. and what\\'s the point if you can belief anything in a tv story? talk about dumbing down, i thought this hallmark-made movie was pathetic, & i can see why others hate hollywood. i don\\'t, just some of these corporate profit grubbers. you don\\'t have to be any kind of religious to benefit from \"jesus of nazareth\", but for this waste of celluloid you need to be bored, with nothing to do, dumbed-down & religious. and for a real movie experience, try \"short cut to nirvana\", a very highly rated film. i saw the movie last night here at home, but i thought it was too long first of all. second, the things i saw in the movie were way too out of text to even have in this what i thought was going to be a comedy type movie like the rest before. the things isn\\'t funny in the movie: fiancã© hitting his girlfriend, beatings. the movie was way too long--talk about wanting to go to sleep and wondering when it will end when you wake up and still have it playing! some of the things at the reunion were too much to capture--like the lady singing--i felt like i was almost watching a spiritual song show here! come on perry, you can do better then this! does anyone know where or how i can get a copy of this film?!! i\\'ve been searching for way too long, someone help! back in 1997 my girlfriends and i were extras on this long island based film, and we actually never got to see it. :( i was hoping i could find a copy somehow so i can finally check it out, and share it with the girls! is there anyone out there who knows where to get a copy of this, so i can stop driving myself crazy? (also, it doesn\\'t matter if its in in vhs format, i\\'m still in the ice age myself.) if you, or anyone you know, has a copy of this film please help, i would be willing to pay for a good copy of it! this show was not only great human drama but portrayed racism in this country in a raw, all too true to life manner. when one show can be so witty and entertaining and yet so poignant and educational all at once, this is television in its highest form. the acting was phenomenal. the writing was exceptional. not only did the show portray race relations in a straightforward manner that seems unmatched by any other television series, but its ability to depict this subject matter as it existed in the 1960\\'s alongside how it exists in the beginning of the twenty-first century powerfully demonstrates the ways we have changed, and sadly, the many more ways we have not. a young couple -- father ben (solid charles bateman), wife nicky (the lovely ahna capri) and their daughter kt (the cute geri reischl of \"i dismember mama\" fame) -- find themselves trapped in a small california desert town populated by hysterical lunatics. worse yet, there\\'s a pernicious satanic cult that\\'s been abducting little children for their own diabolical purposes. director bernard mceveety, working from an offbeat and inspired script by william welch and l.q. jones (\"devil times five\" director sean macgregor came up with the bizarre story), relates the compellingly oddball plot at a slow, yet steady pace and ably creates a creepy, edgy, mysterious ooga-booga atmosphere. strother martin delivers a wonderfully wicked and robust performance as doc duncan, who\\'s the gleefully sinister leader of the evil sect. the top-rate cast of excellent character actors qualifies as a substantial asset: jones as gruff, no-nonsense sheriff hillsboro, alvy moore as friendly local toby, and charles robinson as a shrewd, fiercely devout priest jack. john arthur morrill\\'s bright, polished widescreen cinematography, jamie mendoza-nava\\'s spooky score, and the wild, rousing climactic black mass ritual are all likewise up to speed. the idea of having toys come to murderous life is simply ingenious (the opening scene with a toy tank coming real and crushing a family in their car is truly jolting). nice eerily ambiguous ending, too. a pleasingly idiosyncratic and under-appreciated winner. absolutely nothing is redeeming about this total piece of trash, and the only thing worse than seeing this film is seeing it in english class. this is literally one of the worst films i have ever seen. it totally ignores and contradicts any themes it may present, so the story is just really really dull. thank god the 80\\'s are over, and god save whatever man was actually born as \"james bond iii\". if you\\'re a t-rex/marc bolan fan, i recommend you check this out. it shows a whimsical side of marc bolan as well as ringo starr, apparently having a pretty good time shooting some of the scenes that aren\\'t part of the concert, but fun to watch, leaving you with a sense of getting to know them as just people, and when the concert is shown a talented musician, both playful and professional that rocks and seems to impress the screaming girls. watching him in concert, you would never know that being a rock star is a job, but just having a great time playing some great songs with some good friends, like elton john and ringo starr appearing in some of the live performances. true, there are a few songs missing that i would like to have seen on there, but like any album it can\\'t have everything. i just bought this in 2006, but if i would have know it came out in 1972, i would have definitely bought it years ago. sad and strange that a man with so many songs about his love for cars, would never learn to drive and would die in a car crash! i was at the same screenwriters conference and saw the movie. i thought the writer - sue smith - very clearly summarised what the film was about. however, the movie really didn\\'t need explanation. i thought the themes were abundantly clear, and inspiring. a movie which deals with the the ability to dare, to face fear - especially fear passed down from parental figures - and overcome it and, in doing so, embrace life\\'s possibilities, is a film to be treasured and savoured. i enjoyed it much more than the much-hyped \\'somersault.\\' i also think mandy62 was a bit unkind to hugo weaving. as a bloke about his vintage, i should look so good! i agree that many australian films have been lacklustre recently, but \\'peaches\\' delivers the goods. i\\'m glad i saw it. from the very opening scene you will notice just how hard they tried to mimic the very smart and powerful \\'cruel intentions\\', and how flat it landed. you\\'ll also notice what a terrible choice they made by casting robin dunne as valmont... then in the second scene, you meet the two best things in this movie, amy adams and mimi rogers as kathryn and her mother. that is, if you can get past the fact that kathryn wasn\\'t blonde in the first film... then the movie goes on, you see the cheap romantic story from miles ago, and you notice sebastian has already met an anette in the past, here called danielle, and a cecile, here called cherie... how original is that for a prequel. then it turns into a low budget \\'wild things\\' type of film with lots and lots of oh-my \"twists\". as i mentioned, robin dunne was a very bad choice. not that he is a bad actor, he\\'s good.. he just doesn\\'t have the charisma ryan did. amy adams, who is in my opinion one of the most talented young actresses of our time, once again delivers. but with all the talent in the world, there is no way one could save this trash. as a whole, this \"movie\" feels like a \\'beverly hills, 90210\\' episode. the score has been stolen from \\'cruel intentions\\' and \\'jawbreaker\\'... yes, they used the score from jawbreaker... couldn\\'t they at least leave that one alone?! you\\'ll want to pass this one. if you want more cruel intentions, watch stephen frears\\' dangerous liaisons. \"the chipmunk adventure\" is one of the greatest animated movies of the 1980\\'s. alvin and the chipmunks have always been of some interest to me, since they were what really got me into rock and roll. neither one of the chipmunks has any bad traits. alvin\\'s really the star and has all the cool looks. theodore is the lovable sensitive one. then there\\'s simon (my personal favorite), the smart one who is often a party pooper. i also like the chipettes a lot. there\\'s brittany, who, like alvin, is one who is always trying to be so popular. then there\\'s eleanor, who, like theodore, is sweet, sensitive, and loves food. janette is the only chipette who is not much like her counterpart; she\\'s very naive and really clumsy. in the chipmunks\\' very first full-length movie, david seville is going on a business trip to europe, and he\\'s leaving the boys with miss miller while he\\'s gone. while playing an arcade game, alvin loses against brittany and then says that if he had the money, he\\'d race brittany around the world for real. unbeknownest to the kids, a man named klaus furschtien and his sister, claudia, who have been trying to come up with a sneaky way to deliver diamonds around the world in exchange for cash, overheard this conversation and said that they\\'d let them race around the world for $100,000. alvin and brittany accept it and go on the race. this adventurous movie has a lot of great songs. \"off to see the world\" made for an appropriate theme song for the movie. then there is \"getting lucky\", one of my favorite songs in the movie. \"my mother\" is most likely the sappiest song in the movie, but it always makes me cry. \"wooly bully\" is the only cover song used in the movie (the rest were completely original). then, of course, there\\'s \"the boys and girls of rock and roll\", which, in my opinion, has to be one of the greatest musical numbers in movie history. i used to watch this movie very often, until my recorded tape of it died. i still watch the movie, though. this is actually a fun movie for people who are about to go on a vacation to a foreign country for the first time. it\\'ll give you an idea of what kind of stuff you\\'d expect out of world travel. definitely one of my childhood movies, and one that i\\'d recommend to 80\\'s fans and alvin & the chipmunks fans. if you can watch a bond film from 1983 that isn\\'t as good as octopussy and still enjoy it. if you can accept production values which aren\\'t that much above the level of a tv movie. if you can look at sean connery with wrinkles on his forehead beneath an obvious toupã©e and still see james bond. if you can get past an inexperienced basinger, a weaker largo and a jolly q. if you can learn to love an idiosyncratic score, not up there with barry on his worst day. if you don\\'t believe the hyperbolic reviews that it was greeted with on release. if you can meet a poker battle and a video game face off and enjoy them both the same. yours is never say never again and everything that\\'s in it. and, what is more, you\\'ll probably enjoy it, my son! while in the barn of kent farm with shelby waiting for chloe, clark is attacked and awakes in a mental institution in the middle of a session with dr. hudson. the psychologist tells him that for five years he has been delusional, believing that he has come from krypton and had superpowers. clark succeeds to escape, and meets lana, martha and lex that confirm the words of dr. hudson. only chloe believe on his words, but she is also considered insane. clark fights to find the truth about his own personality and origin. \"labyrinth\" is undoubtedly the most intriguing episode of \"smallville\". the writer was very luck and original denying the whole existence of the powerful boy from krypton. the annoying hum gives the sensation of disturbance and the identity mysterious saver need to be clarified. my vote is nine. title (brazil): \"labirinto\" (\"labyrinth\") this was allocated to the fans as the \"winner takes all\" match occurred between two separate \"companies\" (the world wrestling federation and the \"alliance\": an amalgamation of former wcw and ecw superstars. because the final match to duduce the superior company was a tag-team match, the wrestlers were confined to tossing opponents from each side of the ring to another; each wrestler concludes that in order to debiliate their opponents and to intensify the match, interfernce is necessary. each wrestler merely pummels an opponent with punches, executes a special move, and tags in a partner. the storyline had previously been tarnished by the subterfuge of vince that a member of the allance would be fradulent and join the wwf. it was obvious, with that statement, that the wwf would prevail. overall: very innovative storyline but poor execution, which is not the scarcity of the wrestlers because the match format is tag-team. the remaining matches are just revolting: edge versus test: potent \"big boot\" by test, but this did not display the true talents of both stars al snow versus christian: good match but superflous to the pay-per-view taji versus william regal: the worst match of the night immunity battle royal: this was an outstandingly fun match to watch, but because the main stars of both companies were involved in the main event, only a wrestler who characteristically appears on \"heat\" and is probably a wcw light-heavyweight reject (i.e. the hurricane who is merely hired as an entertainer) hardy boyz versus dudley boyz: the best match of the night: jeff hardy executed a \"swanton bomb\" from the summit of a cage and through a wooden table and matt was wedged into the cage, which appeared to be extremely painful. because stone cold was the wwf champion, rob van dam was the hardcore champion, and kurt angle was a \"mole\" in the alliance, all fundamental stars in the main event on the faction of \"the alliance\" were granted work after the match\\'s outcome, except for booker t., who recently attacked a wrestler on \"raw\" and will inevitably be given work. shane mcmahon will return to television somehow, and everyone desired to witness the downfall and demise of \"the alliance\" to see stone cold out of work. the wwf has done much better. a match in which all tiltes were brought to one faction would have been better, and what ever became of casket and iron man matches? this movie offers nothing to anyone. it doesn\\'t succeed on any level. the acting is horrible, dull long-winded dribble. they obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for. complete garbage, i can\\'t believe what a laughable movie this was. and i\\'m very sure rosario dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit, a wowing nc-17 movie. the problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the oc or something aimed at teens. pathetic. che: part one was a fascinating experiment, which did not only tell a very interesting story, but it also tried to do something different with the \"biopic\" genre.che: part two is the excellent culmination of this experiment. this movie offers all of the same attributes from the first one, from the extraordinary performances (specially from benicio del toro) to steven soderbergh\\'s brilliant direction, without forgetting its intention of breaking with the conventional rules from the biopics.that is what i admire from soderbergh\\'s experiments...they always try to do something different and unusual, and they succeed most of the times. the final message from this film is perfect, and it includes everything we have been told about che guervara\\'s life.the only fail i found on che: part two is that a few parts felt a bit irrelevant. in summary, i give che: part two a very enthusiastic recommendation because, as the first one, it is a brave and fascinating experiment which challenges the spectator and leaves us thinking. as much as i dislike saying \\'me too\\' in response to other comments - it\\'s completely true that the first 30 minutes of this film have nothing whatsoever to do with the endless dirge that comprises the following 90. having been banned somewhere doesn\\'t make a film watchable. just because it doesn\\'t resemble a hollywood product does not make it credible. worse yet, in addition to no discernible plot (other than there are lots of muddy places in russia and many people, even very old women, drink lots of vodka) a number of visuals are so unnecessarily nauseating i\\'m in to my second package of rolaids. as for spoilers - well, the film is so devoid of any narrative thread i couldn\\'t write one if i tried. don\\'t waste your time or money, and don\\'t confuse this with good russian cinema. before seeing this, i was merely expecting another mediocre soft core copy of the much imitated \"emmanuelle\" series starring sylvia kristel. it was really surprising how good this one turned out to be. it actually has a story, and it is very romantic indeed. what makes \\'yellow emanuelle\\' so good is it\\'s leading heroine, the beautiful and exotic chai lee. she plays her character, emy wong so sweetly, that the viewer just has to feel something for her when her dreams crash down around her. emy wong is a much-respected doctor, statuesque, with a regal quality. she comes from an important old family, where ancient customs are still practiced. emy will remain a virgin until she is married, to a man she has never met. the beautiful doctor seems ok with this arranged marriage. it is simply how it is done in her world. however she does not plan on meeting and falling in love with the british pilot who ends up under her care in the hospital where she works. emy decides to do away with custom, and she gives herself to her western man. but only after a very long courtship, as doctor wong is anything but an easy woman. her pilot, george, is a good guy, and promises to marry emy, so that she doesn\\'t lose her respectability and place in her rigid society. neither one counts on a third party, one ilona staller, who destroys their relationship through a series of vicious games. emy is made to believe that she has been abandoned by her man, that he only played a game with her in order to sleep with her. her place in society is gone, she has been debased. the film takes a surprisingly dramatic and depressing turn as this proud, elegant woman gives up her career, as well as a sweet relationship with her caring father, and succumbs to a life of drinking and prostitution. i was surprised to find myself so engrossed in this operatically tragic tale. i was on the edge of my seat when george blows back into town, and unknowingly walks into a hotel where his beautiful emy is working as a prostitute! classic drama. i imagine many viewers were a bit frustrated by all this drama. one would expect lots of sex and nudity here, but there is not much. and when there is, it is totally non-exploitative, and very artsy and soft-core. if you are a fan of the first emmanuelle, with sylvia kristel, than you most likely will appreciate this, lesser known classic. i was especially impressed by the extra attention to details. the whole segment where emy takes george to her fathers house on the island is really nice. her father shows george, and the viewer his impressive collection of bonzai trees. he has a whole miniature forest built out of these amazing trees. totally unexpected. after catching it on late night cable tv years ago, i spent much time searching the internet for a copy of the film. when i finally got it i found that the video version was longer. more sex? no, more melodrama. for the dvd release there is a subplot about george suddenly keeling over with some unknown deadly disease! i actually preferred the cable version better. i am glad that this rare gem has been released finally on dvd. i must also mention the beautiful cinematography and the bizarre and catchy 70\\'s soundtrack. while watching this one you just get the feeling that you are watching something very rare, and quite special. i recommend it to thoughtful viewers who don\\'t need sex and violence to maintain their interest. wonderful romance comedy drama about an italian widow (cher) who\\'s planning to marry a man she\\'s comfortable with (danny aiello) until she falls for his headstrong, angry brother (nicholas cage). the script is sharp with plenty of great lines, the acting is wonderful, the accents (i\\'ve been told) are letter perfect and the cinematography is beautiful. new york has never looked so good on the screen. a must-see primarily for cher and olympia dukakis--they\\'re both fantastic and richly deserved the oscars they got. a beautiful, funny film. a must see! ***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** released in 1956,and considered quite racy at the time, douglas sirk\\'s over the top candy colored melodrama is still a wonderful thing. the plot concerns the goings on in an oil rich dysfunctional texas family that includes big brother kyle, who is insecure, weak, wounded & very alcoholic, played by robert stack in a very touching & vulneable performance and his sluty sister marylee played in an extreme manner by dorothy malone. ms. malone\\'s performance is telegraphed to us via her eyes, which she uses to show us her emotions, which mostly consist of lust (for rock hudson) and jealousy (for lauren bacall). malone is the only actress i\\'ve ever seen in movies who enters a room eyes first. now don\\'t get me wrong, her performance to say the least is an absolute hoot, and is one of the supreme camp acting jobs of the 1950\\'s. but it is also terrible, because as likeable and attractive as malone is,she\\'s not a very good actress, and she\\'s not capable of subtly or shading. her performace is of one note. she does get to do a wicked mambo,and in a great montage, as unloving daddy played by the always good robert keith falls to his death climbing a staircase, sirk mixes it up with an almost mad malone doing a orgasmic dance as she undresses. stack,(who should have won an oscar) & malone, (who won the award, but shouldn\\'t have) are the real stars of the film, the ones who set all the hysteria, both sexual & otherwise in motion, while the \"real stars\" of the film, hudson & bacall fade to grey & brown,which are the colors that they are mainly costumed in. hudson who was a better actor then given credit for plays the childhood & best friend of stack\\'s, and the stalked love interest of malone\\'s who moans & groans over rock through most of the film. but hudson wants no part of her,and instead is in love with bacall who is married to stack. no one is very happy & no one is happy for very long. the stack-bacall marriage falls apart big time after a year, and stack pretty much drinks himself into oblivion because he thinks he is sterile, and can\\'t give bacall a baby to prove that he\\'s a man. sirk who was a very intelligent man, and had a long & fascinating career both in films and theatre in germany, ended his hollywood career at universal in the mid 1950\\'s with a series of intense vividly colored \"women\\'s movies\" or melodramas. although they were mainly adapted from medicore or trashy source material,in sirk\\'s hands they became masterpieces of the genre. sirk had a wonderful sense of color & design which he brought to play in these films filling his wide screen spaces with characters who played out their emotional lives among weird color combinations & lighting, make believe shadows, and lots of mirroed reflections. in \"written\" the characters are always peeking out of windows, listening at doors or sneaking around. so in the end, after much violence, an accidental murder, a miscarriage & more sirk ends the movie with a final & startling scene of a \"reborn\" and reformed malone in a man-tailored suit, sitting at a desk foundling a miniature oilwell. an interesting movie with jordana brewster as a young woman who travels to europe in an attempt to find out what became of her older sister (cameron diaz) who mysteriously died years earlier. brewster is very good and keeps you involved despite some unrealistic plotting, such as having her amazinly find and start a romance with her dead sister\\'s much older boyfriend (christopher eccleston). still, mostly good. grade: b [i saw this movie once late on a public tv station, so i don\\'t know if it\\'s on video or not.] this is one of the \"baby burlesks\" (sic) that shirley temple did in the early 1930s. it is hard to believe that anyone would let their daughter be in this racy little film which today might just be considered this side of \"kiddie porn\". shirley temple stars in a cast which probably has an average age of 5. they are all in diapers, and are in a saloon which serves milk instead of alcohol. the \"cash\" is in the form of lollipops. shirley playing a \"femme fatale\" sashays up to the bar and talks to soldiers who make suggestive comments about her (!). but shirley doesn\\'t need really their lollipops/cash because her purse is full of ones from other \"men\". meanwhile a little black boy does a suggestive dance on a nearby table (!). what a strange film . . . infants using racy dialogue playing adult roles in a saloon. who thought up this stuff any way? duck_of_death needs to watch this film again, as his major criticism is completely baseless. the film never once forgot about the time delay, and it was mentioned explicitly in a couple of places. the crew were never shown having conversations with mission control that didn\\'t obey the time delay rules. one thing i did think was a bit far-fetched was the amount of risk involved - would a crew land on a planet on which pressure suits would only last two hours? i doubt it. would a manned space ship go into a star\\'s corona? i doubt it. would humans land on a moon that was being bombarded with huge amounts of radiation? i doubt it. also, the ship seemed overly sturdy. would a ship designed like that risk atmospheric flight to slow it down? i doubt it. would it survive being hit by comet debris? i doubt it. i think in both cases the stresses on the structure would be too much. but all-in-all, the unlikely scenarios were compensated by some nicely done special effects, good editing and production, and some good acting, especially by the actors portraying the ship\\'s commander and the russian cosmonaut. i don\\'t remember this film getting a cinema release over here. i only saw it when it came onto cable. the film deals with the dehumanisation of children into killing machines. specifically one person, the way he gets replaced and dumped (literally) into an off-world community where he finds himself unable to cope with coming to terms with who he really is and what he feels. seems to me that a lot of people expected this to be rambo in space, and would have been happy if it was. i\\'m certainly happy it was\\'nt - kurt does a fine job of portraying an emotional cripple. the scene where he\\'s sitting outside the compound shows this, albeit the decision for two slow-mo replays detracts from the moment. this is not a classic sf movie in the way that bladerunner, alien, silent running, logan\\'s run or thx1138 were, however it is unfortunately the nearest i\\'ve seen to it in a long time. he changes in the movie to a believable degree, he does\\'nt crack arnie one liners, he does\\'nt become snake plissken and there is no definative happy ending. that\\'s why this film did\\'nt do well. it did\\'nt follow formula, and among a 18-25 year old target american audience, that\\'s unforgivable as it was was\\'nt what they expected to see. fear and discipline. always. however, the ladies of all ages will lap it up, no doubt; at least the opposite sex understand what it is to be a mother, and most of us men try to fathom out what it is to be a father. whether changing nappies is not at all my favourite occupation and trying to get those bottled baby-foodstuffs into errant toothless mouths must rank very high on household duties preferably left to its mother, has absolutely nothing to do with the matter. some good interpretations here, and a good story idea; the handling of the matter, limited to rather scanty tv-production concepts, gives the film a rather over-mellowy taste with not much new to offer. an insipid way of delivering the goods, and in the end the outcome is so forseeable during the last 20 minutes or so, even my wife dozed off, and i was jumping up to the computer to get the on-line scoring in the barcelona-deportivo match, hoping the away team would do something rather good. they did. this film did not. better by far is mike leigh\\'s magnificent \"secrets and lies\" (qv) which touches on the same subject matter, but with brenda blethyn playing a far superior part. this movie is not very good.in fact, it is the worst elvis movie i have seen.it has very little plot,mostly partying,beer drinking and fighting. burgess meredith and thomas gomez are wasted. i don\\'t know why they did this movie.you could say elvis was wasted as well,he is much,much better in \"follow that dream.\" this was the worst movie i\\'ve ever seen, yet it was also the best movie. sci fi original movie\\'s are supposed to be bad, that\\'s what makes them fun! the line, \"i like my dinosaur meat well done!\" is probably the best quote ever! also, the plot sounds like something out of a pot induced dream. i can imagine it now, the writers waking up after a long night of getting high and playing dance dance revolution, then putting ideas together for this: space marines got to alien planet, which is infested with dinosaurs and has medieval houses in it, to protect a science team studying the planet. best idea ever! in fact, in fits the complete sci fi original movie checklist: guns dinosaurs medieval times space travel terrible acting so go watch this movie, but don\\'t buy it. a very hyped-up, slick, edgy reinterpretation. they\\'ve fallen into the \"because it\\'s modern, it has to be hyped-up, slick, etc.\" trap. \"romeo and juliet\" carried this idea off much more successfully, but i really think it\\'s time we move beyond the two extremes here (period piece vs. edgy film). just because this is a \"modern\" retelling, doesn\\'t mean the movie has to look like a magazine ad, or have anything to do with drugs or guns. if the trappings were as subtle as the honeyed words, macbeth would be a far more powerful film. as it is, read your shakespeare. read it out loud. ask your oxford dictionary some questions. skip the film. or don\\'t, but you\\'ve been warned. sorry for the super-long review. imdb made me do it. i had heard interesting critics on this movie. i believed it was a love story but i wasn\\'t sure what was the plot about. so, when i finally saw it, i found myself in the middle of a love relationship between the ex-con isabel (isabel ampudia) and the junkie rufo (sebastiã¡n haro). so, a love story but not probably what i was expecting. the movie is focused on isabel, as she struggles to get back into society. she doesn\\'t want to return back to her neighborhood and she finds herself without a home or anywhere to go. so, while she just experiences those first hours of freedom after being released from jail she came across rufo, an old acquittance of her which while she was in had become a junkie and lives on the streets. not having where to go, and without money or feasible source of income, she decides to join rufo on his residence: a covered area on a lonely street. the story by itself is moving. it explains how the, impossible, relationship between isabel and rufo gets deeper until the the almost final twist of the movie. definitely, the movie is worth watching. sebastiã¡n haro is splendid in his role of the junkie. a person being able of both being an innocent and tender giving person and a ruthless street scum. just depending whom deals him with. i believe his role. on the other hand, i don\\'t quite believe the role of isabel ampudia. although the movie tries to show the bitterness inside her through several scenes, she is not capable to make me believe it. she is in a way too sweet and too honest for which might be expected of somebody on the same situation. the movie tries to show a love on a desperate situation. it is a enjoyable movie. but the feeling i get when the movie ends is that isabel, with the way of thinking and acting she has, would never have arrived to that situation. her role, partly because of the script, partly because of the acting is difficult to believe. i specially like the ending, and because of it i have raised my rating one or two points. i liked its bittersweetness and the fact of showing that sometimes, survival instinct is above other more spiritual considerations as love. summarizing, an interesting movie, but it lacked some punch to be a total \"must see\". i bought this video on a throw-out table at the video store expecting a good cast in what was touted as an award-winning brit sex comedy. i guess i should have read the finer print. i rarely write a panning review, but here goes. these actors in gay roles really play games with your memories of a lot of far more worthy films. this comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors, the theatre-going public and of all the nice films that have contributed to their reputations. i repeat: is the joke about trashing the actors\\' other highly respectable on-screen personae with this scurrilously trashy flick? can the reference to the austen classics \\'pride and prejudice\\' and \\'sense and sensibility\\' be anything else? how much of a political statement was it to produce this melodrama using these stars? are we meant to simply take it as a lay-down misere that all actors are gay and thus letting their on-screen roleplay affect our lifestyles is accepting their private homosexual dealings in our faces, too? i\\'m sorry, but i don\\'t think so. i say no to this one. first of all, nothing will ever compare to the original movie, but for gosh sakes, they\\'re not trying to. it is just one persons opinion about what could have happened after rhett left scarlett at tara. i for one thought it was a terrific movie and would like to add it to my gwtw collection. the scenery alone would make me want to watch the movie. just view this movie as an extension of the original and don\\'t think they are trying to replace vivian leigh and clark cable and you will enjoy it a lot. they really captured the spoiled selfishness of scarlett in many of the scenes and you can see from the longing in the looks from rhett that he is clearly still in love with scarlett. the fact that you can recognize many of the actors in the movie is another plus even though some of them have only been seen on tv. i always wanted them to have other children after bonnie blue died in the movie and this satisfied my need perfectly. lore60 i don\\'t hand out ten star ratings easily. a movie really has to impress me, and the bourne ultimatum has gone far beyond that. furthermore, this trilogy has come together so nicely, that i believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time. though all three films could not be any more different from the ludlum novels, they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement. the bourne ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete, yet i could not even attempt to stop smiling for hours. from the moment that the opening title appeared, i knew we were in for a ride. paul greengrass has done it again. everything we love from the previous bourne films is here once again: the action, the dialogue, and of course the shaky camera. however for me, that last one was never a problem. i think it adds to the suspense. i will be back to see this film several times before it is released on dvd, simply because it is genius. it is a perfectly satisfying conclusion, and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie, and altogether, an unforgettable trilogy. seriously, i donâ´t really get why people here are bashing it. i mean, the idea of a killer snowman wreaking havoc on a tropical island paradise is pretty absurd. the good news is, the producers realized it and made it a comedy in the vein of army of darkness. especially in the second half of the film, when the little killer snowballs attack, i laughed my ass off. for example, the put one of the little creeps into a blender (a la gremlins 1) and mix it. after that, it morphs back into a snowball and squeals with a high pitched voice \"that was fun!\". bottom line - incredible movie, rent it. it\\'s been a while since i\\'ve watched this movie, and the series, but now i\\'m refreshing my memory! this was a very funny movie based on the classic series! johnny knoxville and seann william scott were hilarious together. bo and luke duke help uncle jesse run moonshine in the general lee. when boss hogg forces the dukes off their farm, bo and luke sneak around hogg\\'s local construction site and find samples of coal. they soon realize that boss hogg is gonna strip-mine hazzard county, unless the dukes can stop him, with the help of their beautiful cousin, daisy. my only two problems with the movie was that burt reynolds wasn\\'t right for the part of boss hogg, and sheriff rosco p. coltrane was way too serious. other than that, i highly recommend the dukes of hazzard!!! i had never heard of this movie, but i like heath ledger and bryan brown and the story sounded interesting, so i figured i\\'d give it a shot. i found it to be very enjoyable. heath ledger plays a 19 year old who works a kind of crappy job and wants to start making some serious dough, so he goes and asks for work from mobster bryan brown. i won\\'t go into details but things go very bad for ledger and gets into big trouble with bryan brown. from their on the movie just gets better and better, with one scene involving ledger hooking up with a pair of bank robbers. and lets not forget the beautiful rose byrne, who plays ledger\\'s love interest. i would definitely recommend this movie. teamo supremo are three kids, consisting of their leader- captain crandall, rope girl and skate lad, all with their own battlecry (buza! chika! woopa!) and outfit and moves. they work for the governor, kevin, and were recruited after wishing to be heroes and playing at that game. they lead normal lives as well, and have family and school duties, but most of the action takes place away from school fighting villains. the villains all have rather unique and singular traits, such as mister vague and his men who never seem to know what their plans are but act anyway. from an evil robot to a wicked baron the three have to encounter them and stop their evil, and often strange, plans to gain power, take revenge etc. the animation itself is quite nice and smooth, but the style appears to be simple on purpose. the backgrounds have overlapping colour and the buildings seem futuristic. the music is quite nice, and the show isn\\'t too bad altogether, although the style isn\\'t my favourite. the plots are almost always nonsensical and ridiculous, but after all this is a cartoon and one can\\'t blame them for that. however this would not be in the same rank as fillmore! or pepper ann. i cannot believe how popular this show is. i consider myself an avid sci-fi fan. i have read countless sci-fi novels and have enjoyed many sci-fi movies and tv shows. i really wouldn\\'t even consider this true sci-fi. every episode i have sat through was like a lame, watered down version of a star trek episode, minus anything that might make it interesting or exciting. it\\'s basically a bunch of people standing around in army fatigues, talking about something boring, who occasionally go through the stargate and end up on a planet that looks just like earth, with people who look and sound just like humans! it seemed extremely low budget. the characters are all forgettable one dimensional cutouts, and the many attempts at humor fall flat. it reminds me when you see a commercial with a famous athlete in it, trying to be funny, but he is not. it is just sad. the movie was terrible as well. there is so much you can do with a portal through space, yet every place the army people go is boring! this shows no imagination! i actually thought the tv series \"alien nation\" from a few years back (based on the movie alien nation) was much better. that show actually had good story lines and decent characters. i wasn\\'t crazy about \"alien nation\", but compared to this overrated crap, it was great! also, unlike the great new \"battlestar galactica\" series, \"stargate\" copied the look and feel of the lame movie too closely! they should have at least updated the cheesy \"toilet flushing\" special effect of whenever somebody goes through the stargate. after 10 viewings in 20 years i too think this was the crazy gang\\'s best effort on film, with more cohesion in the plot than their next best, \"alf\\'s button afloat\". they were indeed a crazy trio of double acts thrown together mainly on stage, sometimes in front of royalty, until chesney allen retired in the \\'40\\'s through \"ill-health\". he outlived them all by years. apparently they were just as mad outside \"work\", regularly playing practical jokes on one another. the six wonder boys troupe head for i\\'ll-get-her-to-tell-me (alaska) to dig for the gold that was being found there. it seemed a better idea than going to mansfield ... because they\\'d been there. when they get to red gulch they find their information was a mere 40 years out of date - they thought that the chips that were in the guilty newspaper they\\'d read tasted funny. but by then it doesn\\'t matter as they\\'ve all fallen in love with snow white and want to help her grandad find his long lost stash of gold. baddie bill \"m\" mcgrew wants it himself however. the number of verbal and visual puns is astonishing, but most of them will probably only make sense(?) to brits and ex-pats interested in seeing \\'30\\'s british b&w comedies. imho nearly all of the gags and routines work, including the gold if patter between bud & chesney and the \"whistle while you work\" pastiche - even the \"always getting our man\" mountie inserts. a marvellous little film, in a rather tired looking condition but utterly recommended. if like me, you enjoyed the first film \"bruce almighty\", my advice to you is not to get your hopes up too high; in fact disregard any hope you possess for this movie if you are above the age of 12 and have any film-sense at all. without giving too much away, the story sees evan (bruce\\'s nemesis co-anchor from the first film) move home with his family to the virginian suburbs to \"change the world\" with a new political path. what follows is a rather far-fetched and quite \\'silly\\' storyline, which is obviously set out to target young children as the main target audience. unlike it\\'s predecessor, evan almighty is a family orientated film with the ambiguous genre of \\'comedy\\' tagged upon it\\'s misleading position of \\'sequel\\' to which some would regard a modern-day comedy classic that can be enjoyed by a slightly more mature, upscale audience. generally speaking, evan almighty comprises itself of terrible cinematic values. the acting; omit steve carell and morgan freeman, was rigid and many of the characters were seemingly thrown in to use up the unnecessarily large budget issued for the production. additionally, the cast includes acting legend john goodman who makes an appearance as a heel and is seen just a few times in the movie\\'s entirety; i didn\\'t quite buy the character though and thought the storyline from which he was involved in lacked depth even for a family comedy. every other character in the movie (especially the wife and kids!) deserve a mention for their acting so cheesy it could fill a king-size kiev. be warned though; it is the typical americanized cheddarfest associated with many mainstream family-orientated films, so i\\'d advise you defend yourself with the nearest grater in sight. it may seem the movie is worthless thus-far, however, it does have -some- promising aspects. the cgi was outstanding and it was clear that a lot of time went into modelling the ark and producing water effects and animation of the computer generated animals towards the end. the particles, renders and textures used were aesthetically stellar. although part of me couldn\\'t help, but think these were undeserving to a movie with such poor ideals and were, in my opinion, \\'too good\\' for this piece of cinema and carried the movie throughout. overall i view this film as a disaster in terms of continuing what was a franchise with huge potential, but unfortunately it fell short to a bad conclusion in the almighty series and approaching the end of the film i had set my expectations high for an epic and somehow meaningful finale to make up for the mediocre content i had so far witnessed. this wasn\\'t the case and i was deeply disappointed and confused come the closing credits. as i sat discontent i couldn\\'t help, but think the movie wasn\\'t anywhere near as \\'mighty\\' as i hoped for. in many ways the film reminded me of a watered down \"night at the museum\" as it showed similar styling and characteristics, but unfortunately was leagues below even that. i give this movie 3 out of 10, as it is watchable, but it\\'s definitely one to be avoided! if you have to see this film, be prepared for disappointment as \\'mildly entertained\\' is the best you could hope to obtain in watching the said production. this movie is painfully slow and has no plot. it conveys the lives of a group of laid off boatworkers. one of the older ones is sincere in his attempt to get a job. there may be some social commentary here, but, it is muddled as nobody is painted in a very sympathetic light. i do not understand why it had a 7.8 when i decided to watch it. i watched the whole tedious thing and built expectations for a huge redeeming payoff. no luck. the imdb rating has always been such a good match for my tastes. anything above 6.5 was worth watching. and my wife says javier barem does not even look good in this movie. he\\'s not my type, so, my agreement does not mean much. sigh. i give it a 1. my siblings and i stumbled upon the champions when our local station aired re-runs of it one summer in the 1970\\'s. we absolutely adored it. there was something so exotic and mysterious about it, especially when compared to the usual american re-runs (petticoat junction, green acres... you get the idea). it had a similar feel to the avengers (not too much of a surprise, since it was also british and in the spy/adventure genre). i would love to see it again now -- hopefully it holds up. i\\'ve mentioned this show to others and no one has ever heard of it, so i began to wonder if i\\'d imagined its whole existence. but the wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it. hopefully it will find a new generation of fans. as a flying and war movie buff, this ranks at he bottom of my list. it is historically completely inaccurate and the cast sounds and acts like they just stepped out of a high-school play. the acting, script, direction, production standards and casting are all garbage. the only saving grace is some of the flying sequences. if the people they portray were fictitious, i might rate it a 2, but if there is one thing that annoys me more than anything else in movies, it is pretending that this is history and that the great people they are trying to be, actually did this! its almost as if they tried to write in as many notable ww1 personalities as possible.there are many good ww1 flying films and this is not one of them. the only part lacking in this movie is shue\\'s part as the daughter wanting to follow in her \"aunt\\'s\" footsteps as a daytime soap star. otherwise it would be a perfect 10. it seems that every actor enjoyed their parts and overacting to fulfill their own enjoyment as well as the script - i have to wonder if a little ad lib\\'ing wasn\\'t taking place in parts. it was well cast and there are some classic lines that will stick with you. it\\'s a fantastic movie everyone should see at least once. i\\'d recommend not drinking anything that would sting coming out your nose. you\\'ll definitely want to watch the last scene closely, \\'nurse nan\\' has a little secret she\\'d rather not have shared with you. if you love daytime soaps or despise them, this move pokes fun in all the right places. this is an excellent little film about the loneliness of the single man. phillipe harel as notre heros is a bit like an amalgam of robert de niro in taxi driver, inspector clouseau (in his stoicism) and chauncey gardiner in being there (also peter sellers). he is single yet doesn\\'t have a clue how to attract the opposite sex - in fact, he really makes no effort at all! he has a stoicism and fatalism that defies any hope of ever achieving coupledom - his friend jose garcia as tisserand is in the same plight yet at least makes a brave effort to transcend his extended virginhood (he\\'s 28 and admits he\\'s never had sex). very good outdoor shots of paris and rouen, where the two software people travel on business. they try various nightclubs and places but all to no avail. my theory is that they\\'re trying the wrong places - they go to more-or-less \\'youth\\' nightclubs; they should try the type that has older people, more their own age. harel increasingly becomes isolated and does a little de niro effort, as in taxi driver, urging his friend/colleague to go and stab some bloke who\\'s pulled a nice-looking girl in the nightclub. worth watching. scratch is a documentary about djs and their art of scratching. from that one line description of the film you would have no idea how entertaining and educational this little film is. it is a joyous and vibrant celebration of a cool subculture which is little known. it\\'s filled with great underground hip hop music and you get to see some top djs (e.g. dj q-bert, dj shadow, and mix master mike from the beastie boys) showing off their stuff. going into the film i wasn\\'t sure that \"scratching\" can really be called an art form, or that the turntable can be viewed as an instrument in its own right. scratch completely changed my mind on these points. what these guys do with their turntables is truly amazing--it is definitely some kind of art--and the turntable, if you know how to use it, can be transformed into an instrument that you can \"play,\" as much as a drum or a guitar. and you even get a lesson on the basics of scratching from dj q-bert (e.g. how to use the fader to get different sound effects). all these djs in their own way were inspired to take up the art of scratching after watching herbie hancock perform his song \"rock it\" (you remember that song, don\\'t you?) live at the grammys. what got their attention was not hancock himself but his dj and his scratching. not only is scratch about scratching, but it does some \"scratching\" of its own thanks to the creative way in which this documentary is shot and edited. there are moments where clips are quickly \"rewound\" and then \"forwarded\" several times, which mirrors (in the film medium) what happens when a dj quickly moves the record on his turntable back and forth while using his fader (that \"wicka-wicka-wicka\" sound). whether you\\'re a fan of hip hop or not, you can count on scratch to give you a very enjoyable night at the movies. after seeing it, i had an itch to go buy a turntable of my own. and i mean this as a compliment. the dreams of karim hussain are to be feared. when the right hemisphere of his characters overpowers the left, shocking images of blood, dismemberment, and various abominations are released. religion won\\'t save you, nor will mother nature or your own family. hussain\\'s dark poetry, because that\\'s what this film really is, destabalizes all institutions of sanctuary. `subconcious cruelty\\' is a current crowd pleaser on the horror\\\\fantasy festival circuit. the film\\'s opening meditation on madness is both well written and profound. the protagonist\\'s desire to profane the birthing process which brought him into the hell he inhabits unfolds with horrific and credible illogic. from here the film continues deeper into the subconcious and tackles mother nature. hussain offers depictions of lusty pagan fertility and writhing mushroom madness. nature is exposed as blood-drenched and violent in hussain\\'s frightening enlightenment. `subconcious cruelty\\' is disturbing to all and rewarding to those who see past the shock into the mature themes of life, lust and madness this very worthy film explores. cj goldman deserves kudos for his special make-up, as do david kristian for unnerving sound design and teruhiko suzuki for score. fearful symmetry is a pleasant episode with a few faults. the first thing about the episode is that it takes place near mountain home air force base in southwest idaho. season one\\'s \\'deep throat\\' takes place near ellens air base, also in southwest idaho. i\\'m wondering if the air force bases are one and the same but they decided to use the real name in fearful symmetry. mulder and scully have some good dialog, always a plus. ed meecham, the zoo keeper, reminds me of cranky, old school teachers. they must have liked children at one time, you just can\\'t imagine how. just like he must have cared more for animals at one point. i liked the concept of the episode, but i felt it had some inconsistencies. if aliens are so adept at abducting humans and returning them safely, why can\\'t they put the animal back in the right place? and the aliens are just now having problems returning the animals? i don\\'t buy mulder\\'s theory of a problem with the space-time continuum. as if he\\'s an expert on that. i also thought jayne atkinson\\'s performance as willa ambrose was not well done. besides those nitpicks, i still enjoyed this episode because of the intriguing concept of aliens harvesting animal dna as well as human dna. this is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever, i emphasize, ever made. whatâ´s worse, my old hero dolph is in it and heâ´s starring it. jesus... the story is actually quite good but the way itâ´s carried out made even my body hurt. the fighting scenes for starters are about as well choreographed as a fight between two drunks slugging it out in the gutter. the actors, except for dolph who kinda sucks also, perform so badly you canâ´t help but wonder if their reason for being there is that theyâ´re all friends of the director, who by the way must have been absent most, if not all, of the time. this is â§12 million spent in an unimaginable way, because by the look of the effects and scenery, the cost canâ´t be a cent above â§1000. i am a glutton for b-movies. i love the old drive-in fare like this movie. this film, made for very little money it seems, does do one thing that some bigger budgeted films fail. it is cheezy. it is gory. it has no real plot, but it entertained me for an hour and a half. i was either laughing or covering my eyes in shock. there are a few great effects like a shot from inside a guy\\'s mouth when he gets stabbed in the chin by a knife and it pokes up through his tongue and slams into the roof of his mouth, and one gross-out with a guy getting his eyeballs yanked out. but there is also loads of zombies, and some psycho killers patterned after texas chainsaw massacre, and a demon possessed scarecrow. i loved the dialogue that the killers spout as they torture and kill people. it has great camera work, and some cool editing tricks. this one is more original than the first bloodbath, and the undead look better, but it is still patterned after those dubbed trashy zombie movies of the 70\\'s and 80\\'s and it still has a cheeze factor that ranks mighty high. don\\'t expect romero, just second-rate fulci. i would say that horror fans will like it, and it is funny and cheezy and a fast ride through b-movie land. eddie murphy delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing i have ever seen in my life. when i saw it for the first time about 2 years ago i was in stitches for weeks after it. to date i have seen it a further 17 times and i still laugh my ass off each time. for those who dont know eddie murphy was a brilliant stand up comedian before he was a hollywood superstar. there is not one dull spot in this piece of genius unlike eddie murphy raw which was released in 1987 which goes flat during the middle. if you are not the sort of person who can\\'t stand swearing then i wouldn\\'t advise you to see it as you will probably hear swearing of some form every 5-10 seconds. i gave this a 10 out of 10 because it displays the greatest comic genius of them all at his best. this is a really funny (and sexy) movie - that is not just silly but has great acting. it\\'s the kind of movie where the characters are so entertaining that you feel like you are connected to everyone in the theater. i saw it at the boston film festival, and i found myself frequently laughing out loud with everyone else, and also moved by some of the movie\\'s more serious parts. it\\'s a unique movie about two doctors, and i don\\'t want to give anything away but there are some powerful scenes as well really funny ones - plus the dialogue is great. wood harris\\' character has a unique relationship with his girlfriend zoe saldana, and brian white and mya are also funny and sexy in their roles. if you get a chance to see it - go - you won\\'t be disappointed. it\\'s worth seeing again. wood harris deserves an award. i very much looked forward to this movie. its a good family movie; however, if michael landon jr.\\'s editing team did a better job of editing, the movie would be much better. too many scenes out of context. i do hope there is another movie from the series, they\\'re all very good. but, if another one is made, i beg them to take better care at editing. this story was all over the place and didn\\'t seem to have a center. which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. i enjoy the story of willie and missy; they\\'re both great role models. plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story. now more than ever we need peace & love in this world! this film really showcases the wonderful music of the broadway show, and the fabulous choreography of the legendary twila tharp! i saw it again after many years, and it still holds up well. thank you, mgm/ua for putting this on dvd! i love the option of seeing in widescreen. mgm rocks for doing this on many of their dvd releases. ya gotta love treat williams as berger and john savage as claude. they couldn\\'t have picked better actors & actresses for this film! beverly d\\'angelo is such a \\'hot mama\\' in this film--i had forgotten just how hot! wow! the supporting cast is absolutely great, with the late great nell carter making a singing cameo in a couple of scenes, as well as the kooky charlotte ray (mrs. garrett on \\'facts of life\\') the story gets a little weak toward the end, but the anti-war sentiment of the late 60\\'s still holds up, and is relevant today. it\\'s beautifully filmed (quite a bit on location) and is so colorful and lovely and really brings the spirit of 1968 back on the big screen. i saw this movie when it was released in 1979 when i was 15, and was moved by it then, and it still moves me now at 40. some other reviews on here say they think it should have been made sooner--i don\\'t think hollywood was ready to make such a movie back in the late 60\\'s-early 70\\'s. the vietnam war ended in 1975, and the whole thing hit a little too close to home, i think for this story to be filmed before it was (like in 1969, 70, 71) bravo to director milos foreman! i love this film!!!!!!! it\\'s nice to see it again, this time on dvd. it never looked better! if you enjoy cleese & all the british \\'pythonesque\\' humour of the time, then this little gem is absolutely hilarious. arthur lowe is a real treat! i saw this with friends on tv when it first came out, and its classic quotes have formed a part of our jokes for 30 years, and will do forever! i have it on tape and it is continually appreciated. perhaps some reviewers are taking it too seriously. i can\\'t believe it is now only available in the us (ntsc of course), and not in uk, where it should be an essential part of the history of british humour!! this story had a good plot to it about four elderly men that share a deadly secret concerning a young woman that they met 50 years ago. after all this time, the young woman returns to seek revenge on the men. this story occasionally made me nod off during the movie in the middle of tiring elevator music and the ever so consistent thunder storms. but it is well worth the wait in the end when we find out just who the mystery woman is that keeps plaguing the old men in their dreams and interfering in a young man\\'s life. the most of what i liked in this film was the suspense in which the young woman appears to the men just before their deaths. the special effects were something. every time i heard her call out to them i would think \"not that face again.\" but it was a good movie, i just wish that the pace was not as slow or the acting not as tiresome. and what i also liked about the movie was the flashback of the 20\\'s, very authentic as well as the costumes being original. this ingenious and innovate comedy packs many moments priceless and great sense of pace, though overlong. chaplin\\'s satire with several classics scenes , he has dual role as a jewish barber and dictator hynkel, an offensive portrayal of hitler . then the barber is mistaken for the hitlerian tyrant and happen bemusing events. funny and extraordinaries acting of all casting, as the co-stars jack oakie as napolini(mussolini-alike), henry daniel as gasbstich(himmler-alike) and billy gilbert as herring( goering). chaplin\\'s first spoken film is brilliantly photographed by karl struss.this splendid film contains numerous amusing scenes, the funniest are the following : 1) the one when during the wwi the barber-soldier along with a co-pilot are flying in a turned plane without aware 2)dictator adenoid hynkel doing overacting speeches including a twisted microphone 3)hynkel playing with an enormous balloon of the world 4)the jew-barber shaving a man fitting to hungarian dance number 5 of brahms 5) when hynkel and napolini each try to keep his body higher than other in a barber\\'s chair; among them. hitler banned movie exhibition to the germans due to its satire of him, and put him in his death list after his proposed conquest of america.the movie is co-starred by paulette goddard, third of his four wives , they were married in 1936, although no announcement of the marriage was made later, one time finished the great dictator.the picture was released in 1940, when chaplin had survived a moral scandal by a paternity suit but a brush with the house of un-american activities was the signal for the usa to refuse him re-entry from britain and he fled to switzerland. i saw anatomy when it came out and recently bought it and the 2003 sequel and as i watch a lot of foreign films in various genres, you have to watch movies in their original language for sure. not only is it annoying to know the voices don\\'t belong to the actors, but they always seem cheerful, like the whole movie is one big long toothpaste commercial or something. it makes an otherwise awesome movie seem horrible and i have had to convert a lot of my friends who used to think foreign films aren\\'t as good as north american films - that they aren\\'t \"hollywood enough\". also, they translation is never right, it\\'s too literal, and screws up the vibe of the movie, even if it\\'s basically saying the same thing. i watched anatomy by myself the other week in german then with subtitles with my roommate because he was on his laptop and didn\\'t want to have to miss parts when he couldn\\'t see the subtitles because he was typing. 30 mins in and he begged me to let him finish his work then start the movie over with subtitles. he loved it! both movies are awesome as intellectual horror films! kelly this could have been better,but it was alright...it helped me get away from my boredom.i didnt even wanna see it,the only reason i wanted to rent it is because jamie martz is in it..he is a unknown actor but he is shining and is the highlight of the movie...the ending was so horrible and the acting was good for a b movie...i give it a 4 out of 10 based on the true story of two young americans who sold national secrets to the soviet union in the height of the cold war, \"falcon and the snowman\" wants to be both suspenseful and philosophical, and winds up falling short in both departments. it\\'s less le carrã© than who cares. timothy hutton stars as christopher boyce, a former seminarian who, disgusted by watergate and the middle-class values around him, is probably the wrong guy to be hired by a company running spy satellites for the cia. sean penn plays his drug-dealing pal, daulton lee, who makes himself boyce\\'s courier, delivering secret files to the soviet embassy in mexico city. an offbeat synth-jazz score, lack of sympathy or emotional attachment for anyone, and lots of scenes of guys getting angry in rooms all combine to deaden what could have a decent moral-dilemma thriller. it\\'s really penn\\'s movie despite the second billing; his character gets to talk turkey with the russians while hutton plays with his pet falcon. hutton looks like they woke him up five minutes before they called \"action\". with penn, it\\'s a crapshoot whether you get a brilliant performance or an over-the-top one. here, it\\'s a bit of both, but more the latter, especially in the second half when lee switches from coke to heroin. he screeches. he snorts. he crashes russian embassy parties. he gets pummeled with telephone books. he spits at himself in a mirror, a big goober he must have been saving for a paparazzi. \"i don\\'t know who my friends are anymore!\" he cries out. it\\'s exhausting to just watch him. penn seems to have modeled lee somewhat on dustin hoffman\\'s ratso rizzo from \"midnight cowboy\", complete with overly nasal line readings and constant eye shifting. john schlesinger directed this film as well as \"midnight cowboy\", but he seems to have had another hoffman film in mind, \"the graduate\", throwing up scene after scene of boyce and lee poolside, trying to decide how to live their lives in their gilded cage. too bad no one suggested plastics. from the opening shots, news footage of american decline juxtaposed with boyce and his bird, \"falcon\" makes clear it is a message movie, though the message itself is far from clear, probably because the characters never come into focus. is boyce supposed to be an idealist? or is he just a mercenary? hutton and schlesinger don\\'t seem to know, which makes it harder for us. meanwhile, opportunities to establish some suspense, like boyce stealing documents from the top secret \"black vault\" where he works or lee playing games with the russians, are interrupted by jump cuts to scenes of the pair with their families and friends. it\\'s the normalcy of the story that schlesinger finds interesting, but it\\'s the least interesting aspect for us. good stuff: it\\'s interesting to see a film that works the 1970s vibe so early as this one, referencing maria muldaur and tang. dorian harewood, memorable in \"full metal jacket\", has a nice turn as boyce\\'s paranoid colleague gene, who shows boyce how to make margaritas with a shredder but has some serious \\'nam issues beneath his partying exterior. macon mccalman is also fine in a totally different way as the no-nonsense boss who gives boyce his high-security job. david suchet as the russian embassy official who deals with lee makes for a fascinating blend of menace and amiability. but \"falcon and the snowman\" stands or falls on the the question of the two title characters, and neither the actors nor schlesinger are able to mine much in the way of answers. worse, after more than two hours in their alternately feral and catatonic company, you don\\'t really want answers. you just want those credits to roll. watching cbs\\'s \"surrender, dorothy\", i kept wondering why diane keaton would want to be in it (not because it\\'s a television movie--with the dearth of enticing roles for slightly older actresses, it isn\\'t any wonder why academy award winning performers such as keaton turn to tv--but because it offers no opportunities for keaton to shine). a single mother, grieving the sudden death of her twenty-something daughter, imposes upon--and gradually becomes friends with--the group of young people her daughter was close to at the time of her accident. adapted from the novel, this teleplay gives us a group of self-absorbed characters one would cross the street to avoid. aside from being coarse and dim, these phony people are incredibly unconvincing, as is the tidy scenario and the bungalow near the beach where the kids reside (one young man, who wears muscle shirts to tell us he\\'s gay, hears diane keaton say, \"surrender, dorothy\" and actually asks, \"that\\'s from \"the wizard of oz\", right?\"...no, genius, it\\'s from \"citizen kane\"!). keaton may have wanted to do this material based on the subject matter of confronting death. she tries turning this distinctly unlikable woman into a shadow of her own personage (lots of kooky outfits), but it doesn\\'t sit well with the viewer since keaton has always been warmly likable and flexible in a flaky way. here, she\\'s a crazed harpy who doesn\\'t learn many lessons on her journey of self-discovery (the movie quickly forgets it\\'s about a dead young woman and becomes an odyssey for the nervous wreck of a mom, who appears to be an overage hippie who has never lost anyone close to her). this is the kind of film actors promote on talk shows with the caveat, \"it should help a lot of grieving mothers out there\". i can\\'t imagine it helping anyone since it is intrinsically a downer, muddled and baffling. it\\'s deranged. dennis quaid is tryin\\' hard to prove us that jerry lee lewis was a dumb guy. and he\\'s doing too much to prove it. tv sequences are very good, like a photocopy of old black and white footages. music is fine too, because mr. lewis himself is singing. but the rest is just hollywood b-movie style, with the fifties happy days complex. i think the only good thing in this movie is to see young winona ryder. i saw the merchant of venice in london last week. great acting by al pacino, jeremy irons, joseph finnes and lynn collins. compare to other movies based on shakespeare\\'s play, this production has made the play so easy to understand and follow. bravo to michael radford for directing such top actors. the costume and the scenery are great and since it was filmed on location in venice it gives the film and authentic flavor. i had read the play over thirty years ago at school and the emphasis was on the characters\\' anti-semitic behavior toward the jews and the cruelty of the christians. i do not know if this movie is going to be controversial but in any case i am sure that it will get few oscar nominations. really!here the french cinema hits rock bottom ,and compared to it, the least appealing of the american adolescent horror movies,the likes of \"friday the thirteenth\" \"freddy\" and co are masterpieces of the seventh art. it\\'s all the more infuriating as there were exciting original elements :the forãªt de brocã©liande and its legends ,the druids and king arthur ,all were splendid assets for a dreamlike fantasy and horror film.alas! filmed ,as an user aptly pointed out in a fake forest,near paris ,the movie is fake horror,fake celtic history,fake vestiges -you should see the professor (wilms who was a wonderful m.le quesnoy in \"la vie est un long fleuve tranquille) scream for the \"invaluable scrap\" -which the production probably bought in a dime store-fake characters ,fake excavations... the boys disguised as druids are unintentionally very funny ;so are the girls who seem to be experts in martial arts.and what can we say of the professors? of the monster? a ten year old would write a better screenplay than this grotesque farce.to think that people can spend money for such drivel when artists are still waiting for a producer! word to the wise:maurice leblanc wrote a marvelous story dealing with druids and old ceremonies in his arsene lupin saga called \"l\\'ã®le aux trente cercueils\" .a miniseries was made 30 years ago.avoid this \"broceliande\" garbage and try to see it instead. \"intensive care\" by dorna von rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movies ever made.this extremely cheap dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations.a horror veteran george kennedy is completely wasted as as professor bruckner.the acting is abysmal,the action is slow and the climax is laughable.a famous surgeon has a car accident.he lies in a coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes on a bloody rampage.\"intensive care\" is clearly influenced by american slasher films including \"halloween\" and \"friday the 13th\" series.the killings are hilarious and the dialogs are painfully stupid.still if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of trash a look.you\\'ll laugh until it hurts with this one-you can believe me! one of the best \\'guy\\' movies i\\'ve ever seen has to be the wind and the lion. gad, the scenes... raisouli\\'s bandits swarm over the wall... a staid british gentleman calmly gets up from tea with candice bergen and drops three of them with a webley revolver in his coat. a whisper from the ghost of empire... lest we forget! lest we forget! u.s. marines coming ashore from the long, long gone _brooklyn_. they were carrying krags, it should have been lees, but, oh wow. and the winchester 97 blowing large holes in obstreperous natives and even more obstreperous and faithless europeans... raisouli --sean connery, o, wow!--wondering \\'what kind of gun does roosevelt use?\" teddy roosevelt--brian keith, o, wow!--wondering \"what kind of gun does raisouli use?\\' and writing yet another angry letter to winchester about the stock on his winchester 95. raisouli, armed with but a sword... a prussian cavalry officer, holstering his pistol and drawing his sword... honor. that\\'s something long dead, from a world long gone, but raisouli would never have flown a plane full of children into a building... milious at milious\\'s magnificent best, and now out on dvd. this is film that was actually recommended to me by my dentist, and am i glad he did! the blend of british humor (should i say, humour?) and the reality of a lost, middle-aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were a hoot. add to that mix the reality of what it takes to actually grow pot (those plants under the bushes were not going to make it without the tlc they received), and it is a truly hilarious, yet touching film. i laugh every time i conjure the vision of all the bar patrons sitting in their lawn chairs with sunglasses on counting down the lights! maybe it\\'s just my mendocino county blood, but the brits definitely got this one right!! 10/10 the small california town of diablo is plagued with mysterious deaths after sheriff robert lopez unearths an ancient box.legend has it that the box holds the sixteenth-century mexican demon named azar.fbi agent gil vega is sent to investigate the murders and joins forces with the sheriff\\'s daughters,dominique and mary to fight with evil and bloodthirsty demon.\"the legend of diablo\" is an absolute garbage.the film lacks scares and gore,the acting is amateurish and the direction is bad.the animation is the only one aspect of the film i enjoyed.i\\'m a big fan of indie horror flicks,for example i loved \"torched\",\"live feed\",\"bone sickness\" or \"neighborhood watch\",unfortunately \"the legend of diablo\" is a huge misfire.definitely one to avoid. southern cross, written and directed by james becket is a waste of good celluloid and actor\\'s efforts. a formula film is not necessarily bad if it pays off on it\\'s promise, which this film does not. it is a tiresome concoction of movie cliches that can be traced to a thousand different films from the past. it is full of random and empty plot twists that add nothing but aimless action, such as a trip by the protagonists to a ghost town where the villains (unexplainedly) follow them. this was obviously concocted as an excuse for a shoot out and escape scene bordering on the preposterous, with people popping in and out of doorways and running past windows while firing pistols at each other. it makes one believe that somebody told becket there was a ghost town in the chilean foothills and he said, \"oh great, lets do a shoot out scene there.\" don\\'t even waste your rental money on this. it is a bunch of random bits and pieces from a hundred different films thrown together to call an action drama. besides the fact that my list of favorite movie makers is: 1)stanley kubrick 2)god allmighty 3)the rest... this movie actually is better than the book (and the tv miniseries though this is an easy feat, considering the director). the flawless filming stile, the acting and (kubrick\\'s all time number one skill) the music - make it the masterpiece of horror. i watched the tv miniseries a few years ago and liked the story and i had my hopes about this when i got a hold of it. it blew me away!!! it is far better than i ever imagined it. it starts slow (kubrick trademark) and has a lot of downtime that builds up the suspense. the intro scene is a classic by all means and i watched it about 20 times just for the shear atmosphere it induces to the whole film. also the film doesn\\'t offer a lot of gore (it has just enough and it is by no means tasteless) a trend that i hate in recent day horror films. just watch it! what can be said about such a pathetic movie ? - very bad acting ! the main actress seems to know only one facial expression : fear mixed with weakness. like a poor beaten dog... the other actress (the one who plays the evil) looks like the female double of ozzy osbourne, with an awful red wig. the other actors are so pitiful that they don\\'t even worth being described. - there\\'s absolutely no plot. the story begins with possibilities but goes nowhere : we don\\'t know anything about the meaning of \"11:11\", nor who rayden really is, excepted the simple \"she\\'s evil\" or \"she\\'s a child of apocalypse\"... which is not an explanation. we don\\'t know why the parents have been killed, what kind of danger is growing and why sara was chosen. as the film goes on, we just watch pseudo-scary scenes, with a bad music. moreover, the end doesn\\'t tell anything : we just see two possibilities as if one of them was a bonus scene or the director\\'s cut... there\\'s no plot, so no possible interpretation. - \"11:11\" is just full of clichã©s ! it is so obvious that i couldn\\'t help laughing. for example : the deserted library or the bathroom scenes, ghost silhouettes walking with a blast of wind, ... there\\'s even the fashionable \"little scary girl\" as in \"dark water\" or \"the ring\". of course, the main character is bullied at school and looks like a stereotyped gothic girl (dark hair, red lips, skinny, black clothes). is it an obligation to make her credible ? i don\\'t think so. the psychology of sara is so few developed and so typical that it doesn\\'t make her credible, nor endearing. - terrible direction : as i said, nothing original, everything has already been seen a thousand times and is used here without any real purpose. - there are some funny incoherences. for example, i don\\'t know if \"ghost science\", \"paranormal course\" or whatever is taught in american universities... in europe it is really not the case : teachers talking about negative energies or using \"unmaterial\" creatures sensors... ridiculous. also : how can you watch a movie shot in the sixties with a super-8 camera on a computer screen without spending hours of your time for a digitalization (in the movie they watch it immediately on the computer screen) and how can you, on this old film, isolate a tiny detail then zoom in and see a perfectly identifiable face ? i wonder if the director has ever tried to digitize an old analogical film... eventually, \"11:11\" just worths being watched if you like to laugh at silly movies, or maybe if you want to fall asleep on your couch... but it\\'s an expensive way to fall asleep ! before i start my review here is a quick lesson in australian slang which may help you with viewing the movie and understanding some of the other reviews from australia and overseas. in australian slang \"thongs\" are a pair of rubber sandals (not to be confused with the same american word that pertains to butt revealing underwear), \"stubbies\" are a brand of australian short, a \"stubby\" is a small can sized bottle of beer, and a \"stubby holder\" is a foam insulator for a small bottle of beer. if you love black comedies about smalltime criminals then you will love this movie, unfortunatley a lot of people on imdb with weak stomachs and no appreciation of dark humour have reviewed this movie which unfortunately makes this movie appear to be more mediocre than what it is. a lot of reviewers have also compared it to lock/stock and pulp fiction, while it is the same genre, it is a completely different and original style. a lot of reviewers have also panned this movie for using heath ledger\\'s characters dead brother to open and guide the narrative for this movie, without watching the movie closely enough to realise that his brother was killed by the same villain that wishes to kill heaths character, this is explained midway through the movie but not clearly enough for most to understand. this movie is also reminiscent of lock/stock and reservoir dogs in that it is the director/writers debut feature, and for a debut feature it rates as well as these two movies, as a matter of fact like lock/stock and reservoir dogs i rate this movie as a 10/10 for a director/writers debut, unfortunately unlike tarantino and ritchie jordan fails to live up to expectations in his subsequent movies like ned kelly. this movie is one that you should definitely add to your dvd collection and is one that holds up to several viewings quite easily. i know, i know, \"plan 9 from outer space\" is the worst movie, or maybe \"manos, the hands of fate.\" but i can\\'t get worked up over those sock-monkey movies. of *course* they\\'re bad. how could they be any good? but if you\\'re talking about movies with respectable production values and bankable talent, the t. rex of all turkeys has to be \"yentl.\" all the treacly phoniness, all the self-absorbed asininity, that stains everything barbra streisand has done since 1964, reaches its culmination in this movie. from its lonely summit of awfulness, \"yentl\" looks back to \"a star is born\" and forward to \"the mirror has two faces.\" there is nothing else quite like it. what emotional undertow dragged streisand out to make this movie i would rather not speculate, and what audience she was playing to i cannot possibly imagine, although i\\'ll bet there\\'s a nine in ten chance you aren\\'t a member of it. nobel prize-winner and saintly guardian of yiddish literature isaac bashevis singer was so outraged by what streisand did to his story that he blasted her in public for it. it is a tribute to streisand\\'s impenetrable vulgarity that she not only didn\\'t commit suicide, but went on to make more awful movies. when jim wynorski first announced he would be doing a new sequel for my favorite series of all time, the \"slumber party massacre\" series, i was ecstatic. i had been waiting for a new installment for literally years. so, production began and very small bits and pieces on the shoot and the actors involved were released until the shoot wrapped. then, the announcement of a title change. no longer would this new sequel be titled \"slumber party massacre iv,\" but \"cheerleader massacre\" instead. i was a bit disappointed, but having a different title would be a very small price to pay for a film i had waited so long to happen. i was still extremely intrigued and on the edge of my seat to see it. maybe a month ago, some very advanced copies of the film were released to some extremely lucky viewers, who got to see the film months before its release date. a few reviews leaked on the net and judging by them, i began to become apprehensive on jim wynorski\\'s \"cheerleader massacre.\" tonight, i got to see the film for the first time in full length and i am still scratching my head. as i read in another review, \"cheerleader massacre\" is definitely not a new installment in the \"slumber party massacre\" series, but a slasher flick all on its own. and a bad one at that. before i get into the specifics of the film, let me first state what an enormous fan of jim wynorski\\'s films i am. i always thought him to be a true camp genius, with a winner almost every time. yes, his movies are made on shoestring budgets and don\\'t contain the most top-notch acting around, but they\\'re fun nonetheless. they are what they are: campy movies you watch when you want to have a good time. from \"sorority house massacre ii,\" to \"hard to die,\" to \"chopping mall,\" jim has produced the goods on more than one occasion. one of the reasons why i was excited that this film would be his latest project. \"cheerleader massacre\" does not (in my opinion) reflect any of the films i had seen this director/writer create in the past. firstly, the production was extremely inexpensive and the film was actually shot on videotape, something i had never seen jim do before. the actors were mediocre, to say the least, and the story is almost laughable. the killer is also extremely stupid and reminds you more of your cuddly old grandpa, rather than an escaped lunatic. of course, the film is littered with female nudity. this is a jim wynorski movie we\\'re talking about, folks. but some of the boob-shots seen here almost seem like they were done for time. there is an extremely long shower scene, containing the cheerleading coach, that seems to go on forever and it greatly reflects a shower scene in jim\\'s \"sorority house massacre ii.\" the girl even bathes herself almost in the exact same way. \"cheerleader massacre\" is also extremely cliched, to say the least. the opening scene is literally something we\\'ve all seen in hundreds of past slasher flicks. a guy and a girl making out, on the verge of consummating their relationship when...you guessed it. they\\'re hacked to pieces. brinke stevens, who i\\'ve never really considered to be a tremendous actress in the first place, also gives one of her stiffest and forced performances in her small cameo. we\\'re talkin\\' possible cue cards here. she recalls some incidents her character endured by the killer seen here twenty years ago to the police, while footage of the original \"slumber party massacre\" plays. why was footage from the original film used if it was definitely not a new \"spm\"? i have no idea. there is also two explosions seen in this movie that i am almost certain were recycled from other films. not only does this film recycle footage from past films, but it also recycles the scores from other films as well. some of the music used in \"humanoids from the deep\" (which was also recycled prior for \"the coroner\") can be heard throughout the entire film. there are at least two more as well that i cannot identify, but am certain have been used before. after sitting through this film\\'s horrendous acting, ridiculous story, non-existent gore/special effects, and camcorder-like quality, i am having some serious concerns toward mister wynorski\\'s career. has the man who delighted audiences with films in the past finally lost his niche? only time will tell. oh, and let\\'s not forget his newest film. a new installment in the \"sorority house massacre\" films, now titled \"final exam.\" i think i\\'m seeing a pattern here... too bad a couple of comments before me don\\'t know the facts of this case. it is based on actual events, a highly publicized disappearance and murder case taking place in the wilmington, de/philadelphia pa region from \\'96 through 2000. i have to admit i was highly skeptical of how hollywood would dramatize the actual history and events and was actually quite impressed on how close they stayed to what was constantly reported on local newscasts and philadelphia inquirer news stories throughout the time period. of course i immediately pointed out that the actress (who i really like in cold case) who played fahey looked nothing like her (anne marie was actually prettier). i have to admit though that mark harmon really nailed the type of personality that was revealed as capano\\'s and the behavior that capano exhibited throughout this period. details of the case were right on...no deviations of dramatic effect...even down to the carpet, gun, furniture, and cooler. in conclusion, i also wanted to add that i have met tom carper many times at various functions (a good man, despite being a politician) and i am so glad that he pulled the strings in the federal realm necessary to solve this heinous crime. guys like capano are real and it was great to see him finally put behind bars. i tuned into this thing one night on a cable channel a few minutes after the credits ran, so i didn\\'t know who had done it at first. the longer i saw it, the more i started thinking, \"jesus, this looks like an albert pyun flick.\" wasn\\'t quite sure, though, for two main reasons: the photography was quite good (and the utah desert scenery was beautiful), and scott paulin gave an hilarious performance as simon, a murderous cyborg, but with some style and a sense of humor. paulin must have ad-libbed the many clever one-liners he shot out, because albert pyun hasn\\'t written anything even remotely funny or coherent in his career. unfortunately, paulin doesn\\'t have all that much screen time before he\\'s gone, and the movie\\'s the worse for it. lance henriksen, playing the evil head cyborg, growls his way through his part, as he\\'s done in countless other movies like this. i don\\'t know what the hell kris kristofferson is doing in this thing; maybe he wanted to see what the utah desert looked like and get paid for it. he goes through the movie looking (and sounding) like he just woke up, and in fact spends most of the last half of the movie on his back in a tent. kathy long, the nominal hero, has a great body, is attractive, has a great body, fights extremely well, has a great body, and doesn\\'t have an iota of acting talent, but that doesn\\'t matter in a movie like this. this being an albert pyun film, it\\'s full of the trademarks that we\\'ve all come to know and love: inane and idiotic dialog, choppy editing, and the impression that they lost a reel in the middle of the picture and figured, \"ah, nobody\\'ll ever notice.\" as bad as this movie is, however, it\\'s a shade above most of pyun\\'s other efforts--this is \"citizen kane\" compared to his brain-numbing \"adrenaline: feel the rush\", for example. the fights are pretty well done, if repetitive (after she knocks down eight or nine guys one after the other, you find yourself saying, \"alright already, go to something else\"), and long is very athletic (and, as a previous poster has noted, has a great derriã¨re). it\\'s not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it\\'s not anywhere near as incoherent and incompetent as pyun\\'s usual extravaganzas. you could do worse than rent this movie--not much worse, granted, but worse nonetheless. the movie opens upon julian sands, lying on his back, a black kitten drooling blood into his awaiting mouth from where he holds it, about two feet above him. that was so provocative, and i thought, \"here we go! a good vampire movie!\" and then it died. that was literally the only scene which captured any part of the imagination. it was slow, uneventful drivel thereafter. i was vastly disappointed, as my previous experience with sands\\' acting was quite enjoyable. however, this attempt was obviously misdirected and the screenplay left a lot to be desired. even julian sands\\'s questionable performance could not begin to save this already sunken barge of a movie. it rates a 1.1/10 from... the fiend :. about twenty minutes into this movie, i was already bored. quite simply, these characters were fairly dull. occasionally, something enjoyable would happen, but then things would slow down again. fortunately, my patience was eventually rewarded, and the ending to this movie wasn\\'t bad at all. however, it was by no means good enough to justify sitting through the first ninety minutes. so, i would say that the movie was mediocre overall, and considering all of the talent in the cast, i\\'d call this a disappointment. `manna from heaven\\' is a delightfully compelling film. within the shifting paradox of values in middle-class americans from 40 years ago to the present day, the plot tweaks the concerns and hopes of an interesting range of `damon runyonesque\\' characters. their struggles with moral dilemmas, dotting on `what might have been,\\' hopes to yet fulfill youthful dreams, romantic yearnings, and `hit it big\\' combine to make a most entertaining film. rather than relying upon `in-your- face\\' sexual explicitness, the burgeoning relationship between inez and mac/bake is classically subtle but clear. his untying the knot in her shoelace at the art gallery and their heat in their poker game is outstanding the script\\'s crisp writing is skillfully interpreted by an outstanding star and supporting cast. one of the few films i have ever fone to see twice in its opening run, `manna from heaven\\' definitely warrants national distribution. conrad f. toepfer if i\\'d only seen the poster for nurse betty, i probably wouldn\\'t have touched it with a ten-foot pole. but after i heard some positive buzz, and knowing it made some noise at cannes, i decided to give it a try. what i got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot. rene zelleweger is impressive in her role as â‘nurse\\' betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. i also liked morgan freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian chris rock. the film bounces continuously between comedy, drama, romance, and thriller. yet despite this apparent identity crisis, it holds up quite well. i found my eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end always waiting for the next twist in the story. the entire cast is strong, if not spectacular. my only real complaint is that director neil labute (who made a splash a few years ago with the very impressive and dark â‘in the company of men\\') relied much too heavily on many cliched hollywood conventions. the mood-creating musical effects he crammed down our throats during each sentimental scene were unbearable! and he did the standard old \"let\\'s take some of the minor characters and pair them up at the end in an illogical and unnecessary romance\" trick, just to make absolutely certain everyone goes home with a smile on their face. why must directors and writers treat their audiences like idiots?? but the movie is still much too enjoyable to be dragged down very far by these annoying irritations. in a very subpar year for movies, \\'nurse betty\\' ranks as one of the more pleasant surprises of 2000. 8 out of 10. this flick was even better then \\'waiting for guffman\\'. the great strength in these two films lie in the brilliant character acting by guest and levy\\'s little second-second city troupe. if one finds this movie boring or pointless, god help \\'em, they just didn\\'t get it. it is a mockumentary, something at which guest and levy have a genius for. at the end of the movie where guest\\'s southern down home dog lover tells us that to relax after the show, he went to israel to work on a \\'caboose\\', or when he tells us that ventriloquism is an ancient art and we see a hieroglyphic of an ancient egyptian holding a tiny ancient egyptian in it\\'s hand, i realized it is moments like this that make life worth living. thank you mr.guest and mr.levy, and god bless you. i stopped short of giving \"mr. blandings builds his dream house\" 10/10 due to an aspect that makes us in the 21st century cringe a little bit: the fact that a black person is the faithful servant (somewhat reminiscent of stepin fetchit). but other than that, the movie\\'s a hoot. portraying middle class new york couple jim (cary grant) and muriel blandings (myrna loy) trying to build a house in connecticut, this flick has something for everyone. grant is his usual flippant self, while loy does quite well as merely a wife. but melvyn douglas adds some real laughs as jim\\'s and muriel\\'s lawyer bill cole, who seems to have more plans than he\\'s making clear. as for the house itself...throughout most of the movie, you\\'ll probably feel ambiguous as to whether or not you want to live there. the builders, contractors, and others also provide their fair share of laughs. all in all, a comedy classic. also starring louise beavers, reginald denny, sharyn moffett, connie marshall and jason robards sr. this self proclaimed \"very talented artist\" have directed easily the worst spanish film of the 21st century. lack of emotion, coherence, rhythm, skills, humor... it repeats the same situation over and over again. it shows no character development. it does not even show any violent and/or sexual content, and it does not add anything new to the psycho-killer sub genre. so lame it should be shown at film schools as an example of \"what not to do\" in a first movie. btw where the hell is the \"talent\"? there are scenes which have been shot almost identically; there are scenes which have two or more master shots and it is quite awful to see the action jumping from one master shot to another without a reason. the camera almost never moves, as if the \"very talented artist\" was afraid of showing his lack of visual skills. the actors playing the main roles act like amateurs, and the supporting cast is hardly believable. there are more holes than plot in the script (if ever there was one)... a really disheartening movie, and a whatsoever talented director. this production was made in the middle 1980s, and appears to be the first serious attempt to put bleak house on celluloid. no film version of the novel was ever attempted (it is remarkably rich in subplots that actually serve as counterpoints to each other, so that it would have been very hard to prune it down). the novel was the only attempt by dickens to make a central narrator (one of two in the work) a woman, esther summerson. esther is raised by her aunt and uncle, who (in typical dickens style) mistreat her. she is illegitimate, but they won\\'t tell her anything about her parentage. later we get involved with the gentry, sir leicester dedlock, and his wife. lady honoria deadlock (dame diana rigg) is having an increasingly difficult time regarding her private life and the meddling involvement of the family solicitor tulkinghorn (peter vaughn). we also are involved with the actions of richard carstone (esther\\'s boyfriend) in trying to win a long drawn out estate chancery case, jarndyce v. jarndyce, which everyone (even richard\\'s cousin john jarndyce - played by desmond elliot) warns is not worth the effort. dickens had been a law reporter and then a parliamentary reporter before he wrote fiction. starting with the breach of promise case in pickwick papers, dickens looked closely at the law. mr. bumble said it was \"a ass\" in oliver twist and dickens would consistently support that view. he looks at the slums as breeding grounds for crime in twist, that the law barely tries to cure. he attacks the chancery and outdated estate laws, as well as too powerful solicitors and greedy lawyers (tulkinghorn, vholes) in bleak house. in little dorrit he attacks the debtors\\' prisons (he had hit it also in david copperfield). in our mutual friend he looks at testators and wills. in the mystery of edwin drood he apparently was going to go to a murder trial. dickens was far more critical of legal institutions than most of his contemporaries, including thackeray. but the novel also looks at other problems (like charity and religious hypocrisy, the budding scotland yard detective force, social snobbery in the industrial revolution). he also uses the novel to satirize various people: leigh hunt the writer, inspector fields of scotland yard, and even the notorious maria manning. most of these points were kept in this fine mini-series version. if it is shown again on a cable station, catch it. without a doubt, the best burt reynolds film ever! even better than smokey and the bandit. this was probably the first real bloody cop thriller of the 1980s and delivered the perfect blend of humor, action, mystery and style that is missing in today\\'s films. this one has it all: a psychotic henry silva jacked up on pcp, $1,000 a night call girls, ninja assassins and burt reynolds getting his fingers sliced off, one by one, with a butterfly knife. the film is based on the novel by william diehl who also wrote primal fear, another one of my all-time favorites. this movie is worth watching just to see henry silva get shot six times, crash through a window, and fall thirty stories from the top of an atlanta high-rise. this is probably the coolest stunt in hollywood history, performed by legendary stuntman dar robinson. robinson also played \"moke\" in the elmore leonard movie stick, also starring burt reynolds. stick features another great dar robinson stunt. robinson falls from a miami apartment building and unloads all six shots from a .44 magnum on his way down. very cool stuff. sharky\\'s machine is my favorite police drama. i never understood why this film flopped the way it did. if burt did more films like this, he would\\'ve built a better reputation for himself. he proves to be a talented director with sharky, as well as a gifted actor. burt is supported by brian kieth, charles durning, bernie casey, richard libertini, rachel ward, and everyone\\'s favorite bad guy henry silva. please remake this classic film! get affleck and samuel l. and some other hot actors and you\\'ve got a great movie just waiting to be filmed. i give it a 9 out of 10 plot = melissa is a new girl in town, she\\'s fifteen years old and her birthday is coming up in one week. since melissa is beautiful, every boy in town wants to hook up with her, but the few that manage to catch her interest mysteriously die. to be honest the real reason i wanted to watch this film is because dana kimmel of friday the 13th pt 3 was in it which isn\\'t a proper reason why to rush out and see a movie. when i started watching it i realized that \"sweet sixteen\" isn\\'t a very good slasher, it\\'s really dull and boring and just doesn\\'t go anywhere. after over an hour, only three murders have occurred and the story hasn\\'t really developed in any possible way. the movie is nicely shot with quite nice photography and good directing but just as with many other slasher flicks from the 80s, the movie suffers from being too dark at times. the acting is actually pretty good though and melissa\\'s character is easy to sympathize with, even though she\\'s a complete slut. the story line isn\\'t completely rubbish but it\\'s just way too dull to keep you interested, the only things that kept me interested was melissa she was stunning and dana kimmel whose really sweet and cute in this movie. all in all pretty dull slasher flick that doesn\\'t go anywhere i\\'d definitely wouldn\\'t recommend it to slasher fans. this film is a very funny film. the violence is bad, the acting is...well dani, stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do. the random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexually-frustrated goth lads in. personally, i think this movie really does suck. the story and characters could be very good, if say the directing, the actors and other little nibby things were made better. but the film is just bad, the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has danni in it. this film is possibly the worst b-rate film ever. and, believe me that\\'s hard to achieve, especially when you\\'re competing with def by temptation and over crappy excuses for \"serious\" horror movies. i\\'m not a cof fan, and so i just see this as another rubbish movie...a really bad one. if dani made this as a comedy then, good going him. very well done. over than that though, i rate it low, for it\\'s crappiness. watch it when you\\'re in a happy, happy, joy, joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if you\\'re high on multiple different types of drugs. the first time i saw this movie, it didn\\'t seem to go anywhere. when i watched it a second time though, it made a lot more sense. give it a chance, watch it more than once, there are a lot of key elements that shape the story that could be missed the first and even second time watching it. the cohen brothers brilliantly weave actual happenings of the early 20th century into this story to make a believable setting and storyline. the combination of clooney\\'s leading role blends well with turturro and nelson\\'s supporting acts. john goodman\\'s appearance in the movie is hilarious. the soundtrack is great as well. this movie has become a household favorite for my family. 10/10, for sure. this barely watchable film was a bit of an ordeal to sit through. none of the segments are good, but at least the first one was mildly amusing, and the middle one was somewhat imaginative. the final one was just plain brutal, and after sitting through two weak comedic shorts, the third one was truly painful to watch. even by the low standards of a national lampoon movie, this one seemed especially boring and joyless. a wasted effort. on the surface it\\'s a typical disaster movie: we\\'re involved in the lives of a few people who get caught up in the big event. however, the script is so awful and there\\'s so much explaining of the characters\\' background within the dialogue that we feel we\\'re being treated like morons. even sesame street didn\\'t explain the origins of mr snuffleupagus or how mr hooper died: we can work it out. someone thought that entering \\'enron\\' into the script would give it currency when discussing power companies. the acting is by and large bland, with the exception of the older performers (randy quaid, brian dennehy), and after the first hour, i couldn\\'t care less about who the storms took out. but maybe there are the special effects to watch. sadly, no. even on a 20-year-old tv set i could see one tractor and trailer were computer-generatedâ—badly. maybe there are budgetary limitations, so i can forgive that one. footage of a plane trying to land looked pretty real, but i kept telling myself i had seen that before. this site confirms it: it was from an earlier film, nowhere to land. so in summary, the only good bits are from another film, and when you see the best action sequences compressed into a 30-second network promo, it makes category 6 look quite good. my advice: rely on your network to do some good 30-second clips, watch them, and save yourself two nights. first of all, we know that bruce willis is a good actor but if you take the majority of his movies you\\'ll see that the characters have these moments where they are the same. his character in this movie is far beyond every single one so far... and counting. the story begins in the (not so far) future where a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that has swept most of humanity from the face of the earth. the story seems to go towards sf but i think its closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story. about that. movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more towards the end than the beginning but as you see this movie you\\'ll be aware of this constant rhythm of story and revealing facts that does not speed up nor slow down. its the one and the same speed that flows gently and pretty good. but that doesn\\'t mean that the ending wont pull your nerves, cause its pretty good. as far as the direction goes, it is prefect. movies as such are easily destroyed by bad directing but this one has become far better. so, if you are getting ready to see a sci-fi movie or some action, you\\'ll miss it. b there should be more movies like this. the basic plot of \\'marigold\\' boasts of a romantic comedy wherein the film industry is kept as a backdrop. an american actress marigold, played by ali carter gets stuck in india. worse that, she is out of money. she then decides to play a small role in a bollywood musical, so that she can earn enough money to get back to her nation. here she gets to meet indian choreographer prem, played by salman khan. basically, the movie fails at the script level. just by calling a film a hollywood venture doesn\\'t guarantee quality cinema. marigold stands out as the best example. the art direction is weak and outdated. musically, marigold turns out to be a dud. shankar-ehsaan-loy\\'s is far from being acknowledged as a decent hear. actingwise, salman delivers of his most amateurish performances till date. ali larter is good and has immense screen presence. performance wise too, she is good. one can also find good reviews regarding this movie at http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=36310 pet sematary , though a nice 80\\'s horror movie, with a nice director and atmosphere, is a copy of the italian movie zeder by pupi avati. it\\'s clear that stephen king has copied almost all the ideas from this director (the movie zeder was made before king wrote the book) the cat, the ground, everything was copied, this is a case of plagiary , but, being stephen kind a famous american writer , it\\'s totally normal that he can get away with this , it\\'s obviously due to the huge difference between this kind of italians movies with no -budget (and in part, it\\'s crap itself ... ) but the original idea, i repeat it, it\\'s italian director avati let the world know sharp, well-made documentary focusing on mardi gras beads. i have always liked this approach to film-making - communicate ideas about a larger, more complex, and often inscrutable phenomenon by breaking the issue down into something familiar and close to home. i am sure most people have heard stories about sweatshops and understand the basic motives behind profit and capitalism, and globalism\\'s effect on poorer nations (however people feel about it). rather than expound on these subjects and get up on a soapbox (not that there\\'s anything wrong with that, other than such documentaries typically preach to the converted), this documentary simply shows mardi gras beads, how they are manufactured, by what people, and under what conditions, and then how they are utilized by consumers at the end of the process. it openly and starkly investigates the motivations of everyone involved in the process, including workers, factory management, american importers, and finally, the consumer at the end of the chain. i felt a little sickened by this; equally by the mardi gras revelers, but also by the way the workers in china have accepted their situation as normal and par for the course (even if they have some objections to the details of how they are managed). the footage of the street sweepers cleaning up the beads off the streets at the end, made a particular impression. but that was just my reaction; i can see how someone else might read this documentary a little differently. unlike other documentaries on this subject, i don\\'t think you have to have any specific political opinion to be affected by this. this is ultimately a story about human beings and our relation to the goods we produce and consume. if you have ever bought a product made in the far east, this should give you something to think about. outstanding and highly recommended. need to see more documentaries like this. kudos to all of those involved in the making of this film. as an avid gone with the wind fan, i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters. luckily, the film on its own was a wonderful piece. when the book scarlett came out, i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together. while the book lacks any true quality, it remains a good story, and, as long as i was able to separate it from the original, was and still is enjoyable. however, i consider the six hours i spent watching the \"scarlett\" miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life. discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in margaret mitchell\\'s book, this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape, mistrust, murder, and misformed relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from. the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film, and even carried through in the second book, and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character. in the novel, scarlett o\\'hara butler follows her estranged husband rhett butler to charleston under the guise of visiting extended family. after coming to an \"arrangement\" with rhett, she agrees to leave, and proceeds to reconnect with her o\\'hara relatives in savannah. eventually, she accompanies her cousin colum, a passionate leader of the fenian brotherhood, to ireland, to further explore her family\\'s \"roots that go deep,\" and is eventually named \"the o\\'hara,\" the head of the family. while her duties as the o\\'hara keep her engaged in her town of ballyhara, scarlett ventures out into the world of the english landowners, and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties. she, having been scorned by rhett time and time again, eventually agrees to marry luke, the earl of fenton, until rhett comes along in a clichã©d \"night-on-white-horse\" - type of a rescue. the \"scarlett\" miniseries fails even to do this justice. raped by her fiancã© and scorned by her family, the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed. i heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision. just like last years event wwe new years revolution 2006 was headlined by an elimination chamber match. the difference between last years and this years match however was the entertainment value. in reality only three people stood a chance of walking out of the pepsi arena in albany, new york with the wwe championship. those men were current champion john cena, kurt angle and shawn michaels. there was no way vinnie mac would put the belt on any of the rookies; carlito or chris masters. and kane? kane last held the wwe championship in june 1998, and that was only for one night. it was obvious he wasn\\'t going to be the one either. last years match was a thrilling affair with six of the best wwe had to offer. 2006 was a predictable and disappointing affair but still the match of the night by far. the only surprise of the evening came after the bell had run on the main event. out strolled vince mcmahon himself and demanded they lift the chamber. it was then announced that edge was cashing in his money in the bank championship match right then and there. with no time to prepare and just off the back of winning the elimination chamber match john cena did not stand a chance and dropped the title after a spear to one of the most entertaining heels in wwe. this was the only entertaining piece of action that happened all night. the undercard, like last year, was truly atrocious. triple h and the big show put on a snore fest that had me struggling to stay away. hhh picked up the win but that was never in any real doubt was it? any pay-per-view that has both jerry lawler and viscera wrestling on the same card will never have any chance of becoming a success really does it. the king pinned helms (who books this stuff?) and big vis tasted defeat against the wasted shelton benjamin with a little help from his mama. the women of the wwe also had a busy night. there was the usual diva nonsense with a bra and panties gauntlet match which was won by ashley and the woman\\'s championship was also on the line. in a match, i thought would have been left to brew till wrestlemania 22 mickie james challenged trish stratus in a good match. trish won the contest but it was evident that this is going to continue for the foreseeable future. the opening contest of the night pitted soon to be wwe champion edge against intercontinental champion, ric flair. this could have been better but it was a battered and bloody flair that retained after a disqualification finish. edge obviously had bigger fish to fry. so new years revolution kicked off the 2006 pay-per-view calendar in disastrous fashion. the only good thing from that is knowing that for the wwe the only way is up. they don\\'t get much worse than this. i was just looking at the 100 bottom movies according to imdb users seeing if there was anything to review that i haven\\'t yet and i found this little screen gem. one of those occasions when you see a movie ranked as one of the worst and you just have to be one of the few that actually likes it. darn, well i guess i will get ridiculed and spat upon here, but for me this was a pretty good flick when i saw it. it has been awhile however, i remember it used to come on hbo late at night and i watched it two or three times and i haven\\'t seen it really since and i would love to watch it again now knowing jolie was in it. the story follows a cyborg and a guy trying to escape the clutches of this corporation and some bounty hunters after them. i think that is basically all there is to it, throw in a few scenes with jack palance and we have our movie. some good action here and there, and some blood and violence as well. there is also a love story at play as well as the female cyborg and the guy who trained her to fight kind of fall in love with each other. the dialog sometimes becomes rather bad at times and it is by far not a top notch film, but for a b-movie it is really good. i don\\'t know if it was a theatrical release though because it does not seem high quality enough for that, but it does make for one of the better direct to videos if it was one of those. attractive husband and wife writing team robert wagner (as joel gregory) and kate jackson (as donna gregory) arrive at the spooky mansion of actress \"lorna love\" (actually, silent film star harold lloyd\\'s house). mr. wagner and ms. jackson are contracted to write the silent movie star\\'s biography. wagner has a personal interest in the project, since his father was once the famed star\\'s lover. mysterious events unfold, and jackson must fight to save her husband from the spirit of the beautiful blonde, who is \"perfectly preserved\" in a crypt on the estate; moreover, the evil woman seems bent on possessing her husband, and murdering jackson! this is very much a \"night of dark shadows\" variation, co-starring genuine \"dark shadows\" alumni kate jackson, who knows and plays her part well. robert wagner lacks david selby\\'s intensity. sylvia sidney (as mrs. josephs) sidesteps grayson hall. marianna hill is not a match for lara parker (or diana millay). bill macy (as oscar payne) is good in a part that would have been played by john karlen (in a dan curtis production). there are smooth cameos by joan blondell, john carradine, and dorothy lamour. ms. lamour\\'s delivery resembles joan bennett, which begs the question: why didn\\'t producer aaron spelling get more of the original \"dark shadows\" regulars? director e.w. swackhamer was bridget hanley\\'s husband; he worked with ms. blondell on \"here come the brides\", and with jackson on \"the rookies\". \"death at love house\" has, arguably, a tighter storyline than the \"night of dark shadows\" film; it differs in the movie star angle; and, in its \"father eternal fire\" ending, it more closely resembles the tvseries\\' \"laura the phoenix\" storyline. **** death at love house (9/3/76) e.w. swackhamer ~ robert wagner, kate jackson, sylvia sidney this film is mildly entertaining if one neglects to acknowledge its numerous incongruities of plot and sheer lack of believability. bruce willis as \"the jackal\" never seems to live up to his reputation as a cunning mastermind of the underworld. instead, he bumbles about in broad daylight, parading a mishmash of shoddy disguises. why this man has never been captured before (or even identified) is beyond me. not once is the audience impressed by his cleverness or daring; considering the price he demands for his services (an exorbitant $70 million), his methods are decidedly low-budget and stupid. as for those in pursuit of him, they are at least as ridiculous in their behavior. they show no sense of expertise, instead relying on half-baked conjecture which sends them traversing across the country at their whim. incredibly, these far-fetched guesses (maybe he bought a boat, maybe he\\'s in chicago, etc etc) invariably lead them straight to the jackal, who yet again escapes their clumsy grasp. richard gere, whose irish accent fades in and out like a distant radio station, plays the inexplicable role of an imprisoned convict who is released from jail to work alongside the fbi. he actually makes a compatible partner, if only because his means are as amateurish and inept as his professional pals. at one point, he actually confronts the infamous jackal, but unfortunately the fbi, although they trust him enough to leave him out of their sight, fail to equip him with a weapon or any means of communication. what kind of operation are they running here? the film also appears overly reliant on gruesome violence, which is entirely superfluous and provides no suspense whatsoever. the supposedly stealthy jackal acts more like a demented and senseless serial killer, eliminating people for sport and writing on a victim\\'s cheek with blood. the film\\'s action scenes are both predictable and unrealistic, and many moments are ruined with melodrama. this movie is poorly executed on many levels, the one bright spot being the ever consistent sidney poitier. avoid this movie if you are in the mood to think as you watch it. raymond burr stars as an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend (dick foran) thanks to his affection for his friend\\'s wife (angela lansbury). this was a full year before he started doing perry mason, so the movie might be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his casting. there isn\\'t all that much else here that\\'s interesting though. lansbury is always good, but her character here is very one dimensional and the motives for her crime in the mystery are totally obvious. there\\'s an interesting performance by lamont johnson as a painter who\\'s also in love with the \"femme fatale\", but the burr character is pretty straightforward. it\\'s frankly bizarre to see an actor like burr doing these romantic scenes with lansbury, and his halting delivery does not match his character here very well as it does in most films i\\'ve seen him in. there\\'s no mystery at all really, and the whole suspense is supposed to be around the title of the film and the way that burr\\'s character is setting up the lansbury character to implicate herself (double jeopardy prevents her being tried again for the original murder, presumably). he does so with a very large tape recorder which she doesn\\'t notice when she comes into the room i guess. a few perhaps unintentionally fun moments and basically the rest of the thing could have been done for tv. purchased this film for one dollar and figured i could never go wrong, my big mistake was watching it. enjoyed the acting of ice-t and the rapping which gave lots of class to this film about los angeles and the world of pimps. there is a boxer who kills one of his opponents in a practice ring and who has a career, but because of mental problems from childhood and the killing of this other boxer he retires. he gets hired by a pimp who is looking for a bodyguard to protect the girls that work for him at their trade and make sure they are not beaten up. this boxer falls in love with the boss\\'s girlfriend and all kinds of trouble starts. this is entertaining and it then becomes a big laughing comedy. the story in this movie is fairly implausible b grade stuff, but the script called for a creepy guy to play the lead, and in 1940, that meant peter lorre. and peter is at his creepiest in this one as island owner stephen danel, who gets prisoners paroled to his custody to work at his island diamond mine. upon arrival the parolees discover that they are slave mine workers that can be beaten or killed at the whim of danel. only two things seem to have it worse off than the slaves; danel\\'s wife, and monkeys. monkeys tick him off so much that his violence towards them probably leads to the only meat the slaves get. lorre is perfect in his role here, and creeps up the screen in industrial-strength fashion. although the script is not casablanca caliber, the editing is very tight and there are no wasted scenes. this is a very watchable story, but i\\'m not sure what niche this movie filled. too long for a short subject, and too short for a feature length film, i\\'m not sure how this was marketed to theaters. i just caught this for the first time on a late night/early morning tcm showing. lorre fans will not want to miss this one if they haven\\'t seen it. i saw this with few expectations and absolutely loved it! bend it like beckham is a fairly typical coming-of-age movie about a fairly atypical girl. this is parminder nagra (\"er\")\\'s breakout role, playing jess, a teenager in england who is caught between her traditional indian family and her love of football (that\\'s soccer to us north americans). and even though she\\'s actually much older than her character, she plays the role pitch-perfect. this is a movie about friendship - specifically jess\\'s friendship with jules (keira knightley), her teammate who is also going through family issues, especially with her mom, who wears purple nail polish and little bows on her shoes, and who wants jules to be more feminine, wear lacy underwear and flirt with boys and is terrified that playing sports means her daughter is a lesbian. jules and jess both love playing the game and have issues trying to convince their families to let them go after their dreams. they also, unfortunately, both love the same man - joe, their coach (played by jonathan rhys-meyers). the love triangle causes some strain in their friendship. in some spots, bend it like beckham falls into clichã©s. in others, scenes drag on far too long, and this movie probably could have benefited from overall tighter editing. but this was a refreshingly fun film about growing up, culture clash, and the love of football. it\\'s about female empowerment, chasing your dreams, and supporting your friends. funny, charming and fun, bend it like beckham is the little film that could... and did. excellent. 8/10. note, i only saw approximately the last half of this movie, so feel free to take my review with whatever grain of salt you deem appropriate, that being said, seeing what i saw was more than enough to make me quite convinced that a one-star rating for this is enough. in short, it\\'s a dismal-plot slaughter of the wonderful precursor (nl christmas vacation) with chevy chase, only it doesn\\'t have chevy chase in it, and it takes place in a generic tropical island, essentially with no connection to christmas at all. ol\\' chevy probably didn\\'t want in because the plot is that devoid of actual fun, instead they got the screwy cousin eddie, who, again, was great in the original, but in this he is just over the top, and an extremely poor basis for any movie considering the plot and acting. the attempts at humor are generic to a degree where even contemporary television comedy trumps it, and considering that this is supposed to be comedy, i doubt i need to say more. this is not to be seen for its qualities, for it has none, but for it\\'s failings and again, how hollywood is spilling it\\'s life\\'s blood of the past in the pursuit of a quick buck. i think i\\'ll watch the original before the upcoming christmas season just to try to regain my childhood innocence, from a lost time when motion pictures were more than just high-budget, but mindless, garbage. what can possibly said about this movie other than, \"viewer beware\". christmas evil should come with a warning label like cigarettes do, because this was harmful to my eyes and ears. i am rarely this unsatisfied with a \"b\" horror flick, but this movie couldn\\'t even bring a little scare to a five year old. the point of a relentless lunatic that has a thirst for blood in a film is that he/she should seem almost god-like, like nothing can stop their maniacal rage, but in this film the resident psychopath gets himself stuck in a chimney in a bizarre attempt to surprise his next victim and of course follow along with the all to popular legend of santa claus, it\\'s a reminder to the viewer that this man is in no way dangerous because he\\'s far too stupid to be dangerous. all in all a total waste of film. this one isn\\'t even lively enough to be fun. something is out there, ripping people off (off-screen) after a spaceship crash (off-screen) while government executives investigates (off-screen) and bad actors says stupid lines (on-screen), including a guy who looks like jim carrey with a hangover. the \"monster\", when it finally is shown, looks like an extra from \"robot monster\", but there ain\\'t enough monster fu anyway. fortunately, it\\'s pretty short. skip it, unless you want to get bored out of your skull by this gary busey is superb in this musical biography. great singing and excellent soundtrack. the buddy holly story is a much better movie than la bamba. from reading other comments, there may be some historical inaccuracies. regardless, it is a fun toe-tapping film, and a good introduction to buddy holly\\'s music. jean dujardin gets connery\\'s mannerisms down pat: the adjusting the cuff links when entering a club as all the women turn to admire him, the nonchalant straightening and smoothing down of the tie, the swaggering, steely gait. it\\'s uncanny, and you come to realise just how much of bond in the sixties was connery\\'s creation and not really ian fleming\\'s character. the cinematography is a nod to those early films, the movie takes off from russia with love and thunderball mainly. the main joke is how chauvinistic the hero is, not just in terms of sexism but nationalism and colonialism, and how he puts noses out of joint when he is sent to egypt. it\\'s not perfect - about 20 mins in it seems a one-joke movie and bits of it remind one of spoofs of the day, of which there were plenty. morcecambe and wise\\'s the intelligence men had suspect-looking men in fez\\'s following their heroes around too, and that\\'s going back a bit. unlike sellers\\' clouseau or baron cohen\\'s borat, dujardin doesn\\'t give his character that layer of realness or genuine pathos - he is too busy perfecting his connery mannerisms. it doesn\\'t do enough with the credits or a big song, and there\\'s no funny or serious villain, like mike myers\\' dr evil or ricardo montalban\\'s naked gun nemesis, for the hero to go up against. but the scene where oss117 wakes up in cairo one morning had me laughing out loud in the three-quarters empty cinema, and the whole thing looks wonderful, plus you\\'ll never get a chance to see operation kid brother on the screen, and the women are ace crumpet, really hot. it\\'s a bond spoof without falling into the mad scientist/ken adam sets or funny gadgets routine. throughly recommended. first, i would like to apologize for my rating of \"1\"... the only reason i give this film such a high rating is that i can\\'t delve into negative integers. all \"this is a spoof\" musings aside, and while i certainly have tried to give it due consideration, have left me with a certain notion, namely; \"this is quite possibly the worst film ever made.\" on any level and in any plausible quantification of qualitative measurement... seriously, i tried, i\\'m just as in to any indie born-for-cult-video-distribution film as the next buff, but seriously, this movie sucked rhino balls... honestly, if i had directed this \"film\" i would have seen it as a legitimate cause for suicide. - a newlywed couple move into the home of the husband\\'s dead former wife. it\\'s not long before the new wife begins to have the feeling that someone doesn\\'t want her in the house. she sees skulls all around the house. but when the husband investigates, he can\\'t find anything. is someone trying to drive her back to the asylum that she was recently discharged from? or, is the ghost of the dead wife trying to get the new wife out of her house? - this is the first time that i\\'ve watched the screaming skull without the assistance of the mst3k crew. and, it will in all likelihood be the last time i watch it this way. can you say dull? i\\'m not talking ordinary dull - i\\'m talking watching grass grow dull. there are great stretches of the movie where nothing happens. the screen could have gone blank and i would have gotten as much entertainment out of it. the characters drone on and on with the most monotonous conversations imaginable. the screaming skull could probably be marketed as a sleep aide. - the actors don\\'t help matters much. most of them deliver lines with the conviction normally reserved for a grade school play. i haven\\'t looked it up, but i would be shocked to find that anyone associated with this movie ever appeared in anything of cinematic value. i won\\'t even go into the script the actors are given to work with. let\\'s just say that the characters are given some of the most idiotic lines ever uttered on film. - you\\'ve been warned! either avoid this one at all costs or, at least, seek out the mst3k version. i have seen so many bad reviews on supervivientes de los andes that i felt compelled to stand for it (or at least i\\'ll try). first of all, of course that it looks dated, it was made in the seventies with very low budget, but that\\'s part of it\\'s charm. i like contemporary films but also dig the old ones for what they worth. i\\'m not the one to feel the urge to only see or like movies with modern treatments and effects; besides, almost every movie buff likes old fashioned motion pictures (who doesn\\'t like films from el santo or plan 9 from outer space, no matter it\\'s overall quality?). in the aspect of pace, is just a tool for covering (again) it\\'s low cost, and i think the constant dialogs are in order of a better character and situations development. sure, alive has better fx, but i won\\'t despise the old one just because of that, and i don\\'t feel quite attracted to english speakers in an event involving people from uruguay and for me, that gives a plus to supervivientes de los andes. it\\'s like, even if canoa, from the seventies and based on a true event too, would have a better remake now due to the advance of technology, but i think i would stick to that one based on the emotions that offers regardless it\\'s production date. all of this is based in the impact that had on me because the first time i saw it was on tv, and nowadays i don\\'t think it has lost some of it\\'s primal force. of course it\\'s been a long time and i\\'ve seen tons of better movies in every aspect of cinema, but that doesn\\'t diminish it\\'s true value. it\\'s not a bad film, and i place it above alive without hesitation. just give it a break. this film is really bad. it maybe harsh, but it is. it really is. poor script, every vampire clichã© in the book is used, and no sympathy is given at all to the origins of the main character ... i.e. ole dracula. there have been some truly brilliant dracula/vampire movies in the past, but this doesn\\'t even make it into the \"dire\" slot. take a selection of people who seem to have dropped out of a teen-slasher move, add a dribble of dracula lore and mix in a heady tonic of religious/surreal day-dreaming ... and you get a confusing mess of a film - dracula 2000. i really cannot find any good things to say about this movie, as if it wasn\\'t bad enough that it was made in the first place, they seem to have made johnny lee miller effect an english accent ... whats the problem with that i hear you cry ... well, he is english, but he sounds like an american trying to do an english accent. all in all you may as well say your money (if you were thinking of buying it), or rent it out, watch it, and discover for yourself why it\\'s about as scary as the tellytubbies. p.s. although la la is pretty frightening! looking backwards to that year 2002 when \"furia\" was made, one can easily recognize the heralding sings of today\\'s new generation in romania. the main qualities of \"furia\" stand in a very solid script, with a substantial dramatic core and a really professional developing, plus a cast of excellent actors. all four leading roles are admirably performed, both with depth and casualness: dragos bucur and andy vasluianu confirmed, since then, being two of our best performers today, dorina chiriac follows them closely, and adrian tuli, a non-professional (in real life, a graveyard manager!) cast as gabonu, was a genuine revelation! further, radu muntean\\'s directing is skilled and expressive, creating in a very compelling style that feeling of \"a fateful night\" and inescapable destiny. one can easily pass over the few awkward and even failed moments, since time proved them to be only the uncertainties inherent to a debut, never repeated in his subsequent movies: \"hã¢rtia va fi albastrã¤\" and \"boogie\". one of the worst movies ever made... if you can get through this movies without falling asleep, then you are doing pretty good, considering no matter how hard you turn up the volume you cant hear what the \\'actors\\' (?) are saying and if you can acually see whats going on from the terrible film (i mean hell if you cant find anything that works better... use a home movie camara... at least you can acually tell whats going on!) it is beyond my imagination how people get a movie like this to slip through the cracks, and escape on video... and further more.. how do people making this not know how terrible it is... good god... (!) after what i have just told you... if you are waiting for me to give you a summary of this piece of trash movie, there is nothing to tell... a group of campers on motorcycles get lost in the woods and a bunch of people terrorize them... or somthing to that... whats more so an action movie than a horror... this \\'movie\\' (?) is of no interest... if someone acually likes this i litterally feel for you.... absolute trash... not even one of those cheap funny flicks to watch go rent.. \\'plan 9 from outerspace\\' and have a ball feeling minnesota, directed by steven baigelmann, and starring keanu reeves, cameron diaz and vincent d\\'onofrio: the strained relationship between two brothers, sam (d\\'onofrio) and jjaks (reeves), is pushed to breaking point when jjaks arrives at sam\\'s wedding and makes off with the bride, freddie (diaz), a former stripper, marrying sam to repay a gambling debt owed to night-club owner red (lindo). baigelman\\'s writing and directing debut is a frustrating mess, full of hateful characters and lacking coherence. putting keanu and diaz in the same movie should at least provide some eye candy, but baigelman even cops out on that score, grudging his actors up with little positive effect. very poor. the cell (2000) rating: 8/10 the cell, like antz, must be watched twice to be appreciated. the first time i saw this film i thought it was mediocre, but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing, i decided i had to rent it again. i did, and i found the film to be much more likeable. the cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched. the film\\'s script can be clunky at times, as can the acting, but the visuals are ingenious and bring the engaging story to an exotic and intriguing life. the oscar nominated makeup is also daring and careful, while the beautiful costumes and utterly brilliant set decoration went unnoticed. tarsem singh who has also directed music videos, goes totally crazy with his direction and it results well. he has major talent and this film has a lot of potential if you give it a chance. overall, the cell is a powerful, disturbing and avoids being too tacky which makes it a great, pleasurable watch. this movie, despite its list of b, c, and d list celebs, is a complete waste of 90 minutes. the plot, with its few peaks, was very predictable. it was so silly that i cannot believe that i am taking the time to even write a review of it. flex, to his credit, has grown in his ability to act since playing michael jackson in a made for tv movie a few years ago. tangi, on the other hand, has regressed, as she was more talented in her role as felicity\\'s flunkie some years ago. as i sat watching this train wreck of a film, with its pitiful production and horrible sound quality, other four letter words came to my mind to qualify what i thought of this film. however, in an effort to keep my writings g rated, i\\'ll simply say this film is another four letter word starting with an l. lame!!! i loved this movie! it was all i could do not to break down into tears while watching it, but it is really very uplifting. i was struck by the performance of ray liotta, but especially the talent of tom hulce portraying ray\\'s twin brother who is mentally slow due to a tragic and terrible childhood event. but tom\\'s character, though heartbreaking, knows no self pity and is so full of hope and life. this is a great movie, don\\'t miss it!! john garfield plays a marine who is blinded by a grenade while fighting on guadalcanal and who has to learn to live with his disability. he has all the stereotypical notions about blindness, and is sure he\\'ll be a burden to everyone. the hospital staff and his fellow wounded marines can\\'t get through to him. neither can his girl back home played by eleanor parker. he\\'s stubborn and blinded by his own fears, self pity, and prejudices. it\\'s a complex role that garfield carries off memorably in a great performance that keeps one watching in spite of the ever present syrupy melodrama. the best scenes are on guadalcanal, where he\\'s in a machine gun nest trying to fend off the advancing japanese soldiers in a hellish looking night time battle, and later a dream sequence in the hospital where he sees himself walking down a train platform with a white cane, dark glasses, and holding out a tin cup, all the while his girlfriend walks backward away from the camera.
